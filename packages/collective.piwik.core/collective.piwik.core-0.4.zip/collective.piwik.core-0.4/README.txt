Introduction
============

collective.piwik.core is the core package of the collective.piwik.* suite, that provides analytics data to Plone sites.

The `Piwik <http://piwik.org/>`_  open source analytics system is used to store and retrieve the usage data.

Works with Plone 4, not tested on Plone 3.

collective.piwik.core is not useful on its own. It is a dependency of the following products (version 0.2 or later): 

 * `collective.piwik.pageviews <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/collective.piwik.pageviews>`_ that displays pageviews and unique visits counters on all content objects 
 * collective.piwik.now (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/collective.piwik.now) that displays a portlet with the number of users currently using your Plone site.
 * `collective.piwik.flowplayer <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/collective.piwik.flowplayer>`_ that displays a video play counter in Plone sites that use flowplayer. Integrated in `Plumi <http://plumi.org>`_ 4.1. Works well with `Transcode Star <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/collective.transcode.star>`_
