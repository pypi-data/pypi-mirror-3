This is an small extension to the python kerberos package.
It adds support for "services for user to self/proxy" (s4u2s/s4u2p) kerberos functionality.
It adds authGSSImpersonation* functions that let you (as a server) act on behalf of a user.
No actual delegated ticket from a user needs to be forwarded to the server component.
Instead the server account needs to be set up as described here:
http://k5wiki.kerberos.org/wiki/Manual_Testing#Services4User_testing

For some overview of s4u see this:
