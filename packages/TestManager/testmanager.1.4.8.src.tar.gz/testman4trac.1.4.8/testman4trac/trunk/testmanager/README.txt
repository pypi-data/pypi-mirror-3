=================================================================================================  
Change History:

(Refer to the tickets on trac-hacks or SourceForge for complete descriptions.)

Release 1.4.8 (2011-10-23):
  o Strongly enhanced the upgrade mechanism. Now it's more robust, should work with all the databases and between arbitrary Test Manager versions.

    The only drawback is that upgrade is only supported from 1.4.7, not from previous versions.

  o Enhancement #9077 (Track-Hacks): Ability to separate and report on test plans by product

  o Enhancement #9208 (Track-Hacks): Test plan with only selected test cases from the catalog, take snapshot version of test cases.
                                     This is an important one. Many users were asking for a way of including only selected test cases into
                                     a Test Plan, for different reasons. Now you have it :D

  o Added French language catalog! Thanks to someone who doesn't want to be cited :D

  o Fixed Ticket #9141 (Track-Hacks): Update installation 1.4.6 -> 1.4.7 not possible
  o Fixed Ticket #9167 (Track-Hacks): installation of 1.4.7 with postgres database not possible
  o Fixed Ticket #9187 (Track-Hacks): Current test status report should consider only last result of a testcase in the plan. 
                                      Thanks to Andreas for his contribution to fixing this one!

Release 1.4.7 (2011-08-28):
  o Enhancement #8907 (Track-Hacks): Add template for "New TestCase" - Thanks a lot to Christian for the hard work on this enhancement!!!
                                     Now you can define templates for your new test catalogs and new test cases, and assign default templates based
                                     on each test catalog!
  o Enhancement #8908 (Track-Hacks): Possiblity to change test case status from the tree view.
                                     No more need to open each test case in a plan to set its result, you can now do this directly from the tree view!
  o Fixed Ticket #8869 (Track-Hacks): Loading of Test Manager takes too long and sometimes time out
  o Added Spanish and German catalogs! Thanks a lot to Christopher and Andreas for the translations!!! Italian was already part of the plugin.

Release 1.3.1 (2010-10-02):
  o Fixed a base-code bug that prevented test catalog modification with a PostgreSQL binding. (Thanks Rodel for reporting it).

Release 1.3.0 (2010-10-01):
  o The base Test Manager plugin has been separated and other plugins have been created to embed the functionalities of generic class framework and the workflow engine.
    Now we have four plugins:
      * Trac Generic Class plugin, providing the persistent class framework
      * Trac Generic Workflow plugin, providing the generic workflow engine applicable 
        to any Trac Resource. This plugin requires the Trac Generic Class plugin.
      * SQL Executor plugin, as a debugging tool when dealing with persistent data. Not to be enabled in a production environment.

    Moreover, the generic class framework has been added a set of new functionalities. 
    Refer to the README file in its package for more details.
      
Release 1.2.0 (2010-09-20):
  o The data model has been completely rewritten, now using python classes for all the test objects.
    A generic object supporting programmatic definition of its standard fields, declarative 
    definition of custom fields (in trac.ini) and keeping track of change history has been created, 
    by generalizing the base Ticket code.
    
    The specific object "type" is specified during construction
    as the "realm" parameter.
    This name must also correspond to the database table storing the
    corresponding objects, and is used as the base name for the 
    custom fields table and the change tracking table (see below).
    
    Features:
        * Support for custom fields, specified in the trac.ini file
          with the same syntax as for custom Ticket fields. Custom
          fields are kept in a "<schema>_custom" table
        * Keeping track of all changes to any field, into a separate
          "<schema>_change" table
        * A set of callbacks to allow for subclasses to control and 
          perform actions pre and post any operation pertaining the 
          object's lifecycle
        * Registering listeners, via the ITestObjectChangeListener
          interface, for object creation, modification and deletion.
        * Searching objects matching any set of valorized fields,
          (even non-key fields), applying the "dynamic record" pattern. 
          See the method list_matching_objects.
    
  o Enhancement #7704 (Track-Hacks): Add workflow capabilities, with custom states, transitions and operations, and state transition listeners support
      A generic Trac Resource workflow system has been implemented, allowing to add workflow capabilities 
      to any Trac resource.
      Test objects have been implemented as Trac resources as well, so they benefit of workflow capabilities.

      Available objects 'realms' to associate workflows to are: testcatalog, testcase, testcaseinplan, testplan.
      
      Note that the object with realm 'resourceworkflowstate', which manages the state of any resource in a
      workflow, also supports custom properties (see below), so plugins can augment a resource workflow state
      with additional context information and use it inside listener callbacks, for example.

      For example, add the following to your trac.ini file to associate a workflow with all Test Case objects.
      The sample_operation is currently provided by the Test Manager system itself, as an example.
      It just logs a debug message with the text input by the User in a text field.
      
        [testcase-resource_workflow]
        leave = * -> *
        leave.operations = sample_operation
        leave.default = 1

        accept = new -> accepted
        accept.permissions = TEST_MODIFY
        accept.operations = sample_operation

        resolve = accepted -> closed
        resolve.permissions = TEST_MODIFY
        resolve.operations = sample_operation

  o Enhancement #7705 (Track-Hacks): Add support for custom properties and change history to all of the test management objects
      A generic object supporting programmatic definition of its standard fields, declarative definition 
      of custom fields (in trac.ini) and keeping track of change history has been created, by generalizing 
      the base Ticket code.
      
      Only text type of properties are currently supported.

      For example, add the following to your trac.ini file to add custom properties to all of the four
      test objects.
      Note that the available realms to augment are, as above, testcatalog, testcase, testcaseinplan and testplan, 
      with the addition of resourceworkflowstate.

        [testcatalog-tm_custom]
        prop1 = text
        prop1.value = Default value

        [testcaseinplan-tm_custom]
        prop_strange = text
        prop_strange.value = windows

        [testcase-tm_custom]
        nice_prop = text
        nice_prop.value = My friend

        [testplan-tm_custom]
        good_prop = text
        good_prop.value = linux

  o Enhancement #7569 (Track-Hacks): Add listener interface to let other components react to test case status change
      Added listener interface for all of the test objects lifecycle:
       * Object created
       * Object modified (including custom properties)
       * Object deleted
      This applies to test catalogs, test cases, test plans and test cases in a plan (i.e. with a status).
  
Release 1.1.2 (2010-08-25):
  o Enhancement #7552 (Track-Hacks): Export test statistics in CSV and bookmark this chart features in the test stats chart
  o Fixed Ticket #7551 (Track-Hacks): Test statistics don't work on Trac 0.11

Release 1.1.1 (2010-08-20):
  o Enhancement #7526 (Track-Hacks): Add ability to duplicate a test case
  o Enhancement #7536 (Track-Hacks): Add test management statistics
  o Added "autosave=true" parameter to the RESTful API to create test catalogs 
    and test cases programmatically without need to later submit the wiki editing form.

Release 1.1.0 (2010-08-18):
  o Enhancement #7487 (Track-Hacks): Add multiple test plans capability
  o Enhancement #7507 (Track-Hacks): Implement security permissions
  o Enhancement #7484 (Track-Hacks): Reverse the order of changes in the test case status change history

Release 1.0.2 (2010-08-17):
  o Fixed Ticket #7485 (Track-Hacks): "Open ticket on this test case" should work without a patched TracTicketTemplatePlugin

Release 1.0.1 (2010-08-12):
  o First attempt at externalizing strings

Release 1.0 (2010-08-10):
  o First release publicly available
