=====================================
       membrane installation
=====================================

In order to install membrane into your Zope instance, simply place
the membrane source code in a directory named 'membrane' in your
Products directory and restart Zope.

membrane is installed into a Plone site via the use of a GenericSetup
extension profile.  You can either choose the membrane profile to be
installed at site creation time, or you can use the portal_setup
interface.  If using portal_setup, you'd browse to the properties tab
and make the 'membrane' profile the active configuration.  Then you
click on the 'import' tab and click the 'import all steps' button.

If you wish to install the basic sample content types, you'll need to
also install the 'membrane sample content types' extension profile.
These types are not intended to be used in production, as the use of
cleartext passwords should clearly indicate.

Go to a folder somewhere, or simply the root of your Plone site, and
add a SimpleMember. Enter the username and password, and preferably a
full name to see that the decorator plugin works.

Now, try to log in as the user you just added. The full name should
also show up wherever Plone usually displays full name.
