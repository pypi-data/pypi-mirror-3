Installation
============

#. Install dependencies
   
   For Ubuntu::

    sudo apt-get install python-numpy python-gdal python-nose

   For Mac OSX::

    pip install numpy nose
    brew install gdal
    

#. Install this package::

    pip install python-safe

   If you do not have ``pip`` installed but only ``easy_install``,
   you can do ``easy_install pip`` and then use it to install ``python-safe``.

#. Run the tests::

    nosetests safe

   Please note that nose can only find the tests if you did not use easy_installs, pip uses flat directories instead of eggs. If it says there are 0 tests, it means you probably installed the package without pip.
