Description: mltool: regression tool
        =======================
        
        mltool is a simple `Learning to Rank`_ tool to build a regression tree based ranking model.
        Currently mltool supports simple CART and `Random Forest`_. The implementation is strongly
        inspired by `rt-rank`_, but it lacks the support of `Gradient Boosting Regression Trees`_.

        Overview
        --------
        
        Features
        ~~~~~~~~
        
        Despite rt-rank, mltool provides:
        
        - A parameter to set the seed for the random number generator to make the training
          deterministic
        - Serializable model
        - Show feature information gain statistics at the end of the training
        - Can be used as an API
        
        Some highlights compared to other Random Forest implemented for Python:
        
        - The implementation of the Random Forest makes use of numpy and it is quite optimized
        - Parallel Random Forest training
        
        
        Installation
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Clone the repository, install dependencies using pip and install mltool::
        
           $ git clone git@bitbucket.org:duilio/mltool.git && cd mltool
           $ ./setup.py install
        
        At this point you can run mltool::
        
           $ mltool -h

        Future
        ~~~~~~
        
        - add support for Stochastic Gradient Boosting Regression Trees
        - add support for simple regression and/or classification (i.e. not just focus on ranking)
