Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        Install this package and get an alternative version of event view in your Plone site. Changes are minimal,
        just to add basic HTML 5 `microdata`__ information, taken from `schema.org`__ specification.

        Microdata available in Web pages can be used from search engines, enhancing the quality of information indexed.
        
        This package is a proper implementation of the `collective.microdata.core`__ product. Read it's documentation
        for more information.

        Details
        =======
        
        Follow a list supported properties:
        
        ``name``
            Taken from event title
        ``description``
            Taken from the event description
        ``url``
            Taken from the event URL field
        ``attendees``
            Taken from Attendees field (raw data, not as `Person`__ elements)
        ``location``
            Taken from event location
        ``startDate``
            Taken from the start date
        ``endDate``
            Taken from the end date
        ``duration``
            Taken from the difference from end and start date

        Support for folder content listing views
        ----------------------------------------
        
        This package supports also `collective.microdata.contentlisting`__ but not depends on it
        (you have to manually install that add-on yourself).
        
        __ https://github.com/keul/collective.microdata.contentlisting
        
        Then you will be able to provide microdata information about events also when listing folders content.

        See it's documentation for knowing what views are supported.
        
        Final notes
        ===========
        
        Providing microdata doesn't ensure that search engines will use it.
