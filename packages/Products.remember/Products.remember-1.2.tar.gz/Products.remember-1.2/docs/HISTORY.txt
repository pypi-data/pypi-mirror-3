Changelog
=========

1.2 (2011-12-01)
----------------

* Added doChangeUser method to the BaseMember class.  This is not the
  canonically correct place, but it is needed.
  [maurits]

* Introduce the 'remember: Can authenticate' permission instead of the
  not existing 'membrane: Can authenticate' permission.  Check this
  new permission in verifyCredentials.
  [maurits]

* Set default editor to Kupu (not TinyMCE) as this Products.remember
  version should be Plone 3 compatible and the tests should pass.
  [maurits]

* Protect the password field of members so the hash can not be seen.
  [maurits]

* Added getUserId method, which is apparently needed for more recent
  Products.membrane versions.
  [maurits]

* Modernized GenericSetup configuration, moving the profile and import
  step registration from python code and xml to zcml, and creating
  upgrade steps to get rid of persistent import steps and update the
  existing getRoles index from a FieldIndex to a KeywordIndex.
  [maurits]

* Changed getRoles from a FieldIndex to a KeywordIndex in the
  membrane_tool, so you can search for roles.
  [maurits]

* Use Plone 3's JS schemata/fieldset switching.

* allow usage of portal_registration tools  ALLOWED_MEMBER_ID_PATTERN. This 
  does not change any current behaviour, it may be made configurable ttw in 
  future. Introduced new config.py variable USE_PORTAL_REGISTRATION_PATTERN
  set to False by default. Setting to True switches to portal_registrations
  getIDPattern.
  [jensens]

* Fix inefficiency in prefs_users_overview where searchUsers is called when 
  no search string is supplied. The bug meant that the page would be extremely 
  slow even when just navigating to prefs_users_overview.
