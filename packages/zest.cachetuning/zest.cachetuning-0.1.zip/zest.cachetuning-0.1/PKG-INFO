Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This Plone product allows some cache tuning for your site.
        Currently it only allows username replacment, but we might add some
        more features in the future.
        
        
        Username replacement
        --------------------
        
        If you enable this option, you can cache the whole pages and an Ajax
        request will replace the username in the page in order to reduce the
        load.
        
        If you use a custom theme, you can specify the query used to select
        the HTML node containing the username. This query is written in the
        classic CSS format.
