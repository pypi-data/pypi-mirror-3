        ***************************
        
        Overview
        --------
            sc.contentrules.groupbydate is a very basic content rule action used to 
            organize content under a chronological-based hierarchy on a web site upon
            publication.
        
        Base use case
        -------------
            
            A news portal with a few dozen new content items per day needs to organize 
            its information in a chronological, yet human-readable, hierarchy.
            
            To do so this package is installed in a Plone Site and a new content rule is
            created. This content rule will be triggered by the publication of an News
            Item and will initialize a '''Move an item to a date-based folder 
            structure'''. 
            
            This action has a target (/news) and a structure ('ymd'), so as our News 
            Item, with id hello-world, is published on the site, it will be moved to a 
            a new folder structure under /news. Supposing it's December 19th, 2008, the
            item will end in /news/2009/12/19/hello-world.
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
            * Plone 3.1 and above (http://plone.org/products/plone)
            
            * Products.CMFPlacefulWorkflow (http://plone.org/products/plone)
            
        Installation
        ------------
            
        To enable this product,on a buildout based installation:
        
            1. Edit your buildout.cfg and add ``sc.contentrules.groupbydate``
               to the list of eggs to install ::
        
                [buildout]
                ...
                eggs = 
                    sc.contentrules.groupbydate
        
            2. For Plone 3.1 and Plone 3.2 tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe 
               to install a ZCML slug::
        
                [instance]
                ...
                zcml = 
                    ...
                    sc.contentrules.groupbydate
            
        
        If another package depends on the sc.contentrules.groupbydate egg or 
        includes its zcml directly you do not need to specify anything in the 
        buildout configuration: buildout will detect this automatically.
        
        After updating the configuration you need to run the ''bin/buildout'',
        which will take care of updating your system.
