Installing django-addons
========================

To install the package, you may follow the standard procedure for Python
packages. The simplest way is to use the Python utility ``setuptools`` which
may download and install it for you in one step::

    easy_install django-addons

Alternatively, clone the django_addons repository and install by hand::

    hg clone http://code.indifex.com/django-addons/
    cd django_addons
    python setup.py install

Alternatively, you can simply place the included ``django_addons`` directory
somewhere on your Python path, or symlink to it from somewhere on your Python
path; this is useful if you're working from a Mercurial checkout.
