Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This product add to the Plone administrator a new flag on the user profile: "**Block user password reset**".
        This check will mark a specific user as unable to change his own password.
        
        The Plone administrator can still reset the user password from the "*Users and Groups*" control panel.
        
        When you can need this
        ----------------------
        
        This can be useful only in some rare situation, when you need to share a single user account to a set of
        users (giving them all the same userid and password), and for whatever reason you can't/don't want create
        multiple users.
        Obviously you don't want that an evil guy inside this set of users can change the password.
        
        Plone security
        --------------
        
        Keep in mind that Plone can handle change password using its own security, playing with
        ``Set own password`` permission.
        
        Use this product only if you need to control the change password behavior only for specific(s)
        users.
        
        Compatibility
        =============
        
        This product has been tested on *Plone 3*. It will not work on Plone 4, due to deep changes
        in the user data infrastructure.
