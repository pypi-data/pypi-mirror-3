        RLFL. RogueLike Function Library
        
        ===========
        
        Version 2.3
        
        This is a collection of functions for roguelike games for use with the python programming language. FOV, 
        pathfinding, projection, LOS and various helper functions. This is here to aid me in my hobby to create
        a python roguelike. The aim is to build on alot more AI and fun stuff.
        
        There are a number of examples in the examples directory.
        
        This is not a display library and contains no display functions.
        
        Documentation available here:
        
        	http://packages.python.org/rlfl/index.html
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        	python3 setup.py install
        OR
        	python setup.py install
        
        Then 
        	import rlfl
        
        Compile instructions (makefile).
        --------------------------------
        
        create a makefile (see makefile_32x or makefile_64x examples) and simply `make rlfl-python`. To use
        with python place the `rlfl.so` file in your python path and `import rlfl`. Make sure to specify 
        the python lib version you wish to compile against. Currently tested against python2.7 and 
        python3.2
        
        You will need python development headers installed
        
        RLF can be built into a c lib without python support with `make rlfl`.
        
        This code has not been tested on windows.
