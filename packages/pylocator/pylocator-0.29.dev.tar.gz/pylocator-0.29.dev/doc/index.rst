PyLocator
=====================================================================
Localization of EEG-electrodes from MRI-volumes
-----------------------------------------------

PyLocator is a little program for localizing EEG electrodes from MR-images.
It uses VTK to show a neat GUI for marking electrode locations in 3d-space.

It is based on previous work by John D. Hunter and Michael Castell as
part of `pbrain <https://github.com/nipy/pbrain>`_, now maintained by Eli
Albert. PyLocator works as a stand-alone program without any dependencies
from pbrain.

Information on how to obtain and configure PyLocator correctly can be obtained
in the :doc:`Installation </install>` section.

To get a feeling of what PyLocator can do and in order to get used to the controls, 
we recommend our little :doc:`Tutorial </tutorial>`.

The :doc:`Frequently Asked Questions </faq>` will start with some little basis of 
obvious questions and will then grow with time.
