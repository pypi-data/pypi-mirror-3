Description: Version 0.1.0
        
        Unified object oriented interface for interacting with file system objects.
        File system operations in python are distributed across modules: os, os.path,
        fnamtch, shutil and distutils. This module attempts to make the right choices
        for common operations to provide a single interface.
        
        This was extracted from the `hyde project`_ with minor changes.
