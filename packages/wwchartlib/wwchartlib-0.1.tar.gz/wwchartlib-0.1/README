Collection of Qt chart widgets
------------------------------

Provides some colourful Qt chart widgets.  Requires the PySide_ Qt
bindings.

At this time, wwchartlib provides a couple of pie chart widgets.  More
widgets may come in time.  Feel free to contribute!

``wwchartlib.piechart.PieChart``
  A simple pie chart widget.

``wwchartlib.piechart.AdjustablePieChart``
  A pie chart whose slices are adjustable with click and drag mouse
  movement.

  Defines two additional signals:

  ``itemAdjusted``
    Emitted when an item is adjusted, with that item as the argument.
    If two slices are adjusted at the same time, two signals are
    emitted.
  ``finishedAdjusting``
    Emitted when an adjustment is finished (i.e., the user releases the
    mouse).  There are no arguments.
