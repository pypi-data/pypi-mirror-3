Description: ====================
        Supervisor wildcards
        ====================
        
        Description
        ===========
        
        Adds ``mstop``, ``mstart`` and ``mrestart`` commands to Supervisor_. Those commands works similar to ``stop``, ``start`` and ``restart`` respectively, but they:
        
        * add support for process name wildcarding,
        * sends the start/stop/restart signal in parallel (which makes the batch commands finish faster).
        
        In some usecases you can use groups support in Supervisor_, but it doesn't allow you to have one process in multiple groups. That's when wildcarding can be really useful.
        
        Example
        =======
        
        ::
        
          supervisor> status
          celery-a                                RUNNING    pid 15085, uptime 0:00:11
          celery-b                                RUNNING    pid 15086, uptime 0:00:12
          gunicorn-a                              RUNNING    pid 14151, uptime 0:05:18
          gunicorn-b                              RUNNING    pid 14237, uptime 0:04:45
          supervisor> mstop *-a
          celery-a: stopped
          gunicorn-a: stopped
          supervisor>
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        ::
        
          pip install supervisor-wildcards
        
        And then add into your supervisor.conf:
        
        ::
        
          [ctlplugin:wildcards]
          supervisor.ctl_factory = supervisorwildcards.controllerplugin:make_wildcards_controllerplugin
        
        Configuration
        =============
        
        ::
        
          [ctlplugin:wildcards]
          supervisor.ctl_factory = supervisorwildcards.controllerplugin:make_wildcards_controllerplugin
          match_group = 1
        
        By default, supervisorwildcards plugin match the wildcards just against process name (not group). Setting match_group = 1 will try to match the pattern against "group_name:process_name" instead.
