        ===========
        
        django-moat is a mini-app adds an additional layer of authentication via HTTP
        Basic Auth. It's primary use case is to prevent access staging, development, or
        otherwise private sites on the public internet. It is equivalent to configuring
        Basic Auth on your webserver (Apache, nginx) but works in environments where
        that is not possible (heroku).

            Set Basic Auth Realm
            
                HTTP_AUTH_REALM = 'App Staging'
        
        MOAT_ALWAYS_ALLOW_VIEWS
            A list of views to allow through ``moat``
        
                MOAT_ALWAYS_ALLOW_VIEWS = ['myapp.views.home']
            
        MOAT_ALWAYS_ALLOW_MODULES 
            A list of modules to allow through ``moat``

        MOAT_ALLOW_ADMIN

                MOAT_ALLOW_ADMIN = True
        
        MOAT_DEBUG_DISABLE_HTTPS
            Disable HTTPS. *For testing purposes only.* Don't ship with this on.
                
                MOAT_DEBUG_DISABLE_HTTPS = True
        
        
        Finally you may want to set the `SESSION_EXPIRE_AT_BROWSER_CLOSE <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.3/ref/settings/#std:setting-SESSION_EXPIRE_AT_BROWSER_CLOSE>`_ setting.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Your site now requires that your authenticate with a staff-level user before
        accessing any non-whitelisted view. It is recommended that your add a dedicate
        staff-level user in the django admin for moat authentication.
        
        By default, the admin views will be blocked by ``moat``. You'll either need to
        create a user with ``django-admin.py``, or set ``MOAT_ALLOW_ADMIN`` to
        ``True``.
