Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        ``collective.lastmodifier`` provides support for storing the user who made the 
        last modification on a content item. It extends Archetypes-based content types 
        with a `lastModifier` field using schemaextender. Further it registers an index 
        and a metadata column in `portal_catalog` and enables their usage in 
        collections.
