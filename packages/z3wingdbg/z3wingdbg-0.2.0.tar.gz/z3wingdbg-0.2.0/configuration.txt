Configurating the debugger
--------------------------

The debug service itself is not a persistent utility, but it's configuration
does need to be persisted somewhere.  Configuration is therefor looked up when
starting the debugger and connecting to the IDE, by querying for local 
utilities on the root application.

First a query is done for the IWingDebugConfiguration utility. It's servertype
attribute determines the debug server type, which is looked up with a query for
a named IWingDebugServerConfiguration utility where the servertype attribute is
used as the name. This allows different servertypes to add more type-specific 
configuration (e.g. keys for an SSH server).

If either fails, starting the debugger will fail.
