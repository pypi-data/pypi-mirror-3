Description: shell_command is a simple set of shell invocation tools intended to make it
        easy to build and execute shell commands from Python, automatically handling
        file names containing whitespace and protecting your code from inadvertent
        exposure to shell injection attacks.
        
        It's aim is to allow system administrators convenient access to the shell
        commands and syntax they already find familiar for individual operations,
        while using Python to manage their control flow and higher level
        data structures.
