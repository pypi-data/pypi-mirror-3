        ==============
        
        About
        -----
        
        **mongooplog-alt** is the Python remake of `official mongooplog utility`_
        (shipped with MongoDB starting from version 2.2.0). It reads oplog of a remote
        server, and applies operations to the local server. This can be used to keep
        independed replica set loosly synced (sort of one way replication), and may be
        useful in various backup and migration scenarios.
        
        ``mongooplog-alt`` implements basic functionality of the official utility and
        adds following features:
        
        * tailable oplog reader: runs forever polling new oplog event which is extremly
          useful for keeping two independent replica sets in almost real-time sync.
        
        * option to exclude one or more namespaces (i.e. dbs or collections) from
          being synced.
        
        * works on mongodb 1.8.x, 2.0.x, and 2.2.x. Official utility supports 2.2.x
          only.
        
        * at the time of writing (2.2.0), official ``mongooplog`` suffers from bug that
          limits its usage with replica sets (https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-6915)

        Installation
        ------------
        
        Using pip (preferred)::
        
            pip install --upgrade mongooplog-alt
        
        Using easy_install::
        
            easy_install -U mongooplog-alt
        
        
        Command-line options
        --------------------
        
        Options common to original ``mongooplog``:
        
        .. option:: --host <hostname><:port>, -h
        
            Hostname of the mongod server to which oplog operations are going to be
            applied. Default is "localhost"
        
        .. option:: --port <number>
        
            Port of the mongod server to which oplog operations are going to be
            applied, if not specified in ``--host``. Default is 27017.
        
        .. option:: --seconds <number>
            
            Number of seconds of latest operations to pull from the remote host.
            Default is 86400, or 24 hours.
        
        
        Options specific to ``mongooplog-alt``:
        
        .. option:: --follow, -f
        
           Wait for new data in oplog. Makes the utility polling oplog forever (until
           interrupted). New data is going to be applied immideately with at most one
           second delay.
        
        .. option:: --exclude, -x
        
            List of space separated namespaces which should be ignored. Can be in form
            of ``dname`` or ``dbname.collection``.
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Consider the following sample usage::
        
            mongooplog-alt --from prod.example.com:28000 --host dev.example.com:28500 -f --exclude logdb data.transactions --seconds 600
        
        This command is going to take operations from the last 10 minutes from prod,
        and apply them to dev. Database ``logdb`` and collection ``transactions`` of
        ``data`` database will be omitted. After operations for the last minutes will
        be applied, command will wait for new changes to come, keep running until
        Ctrl+C or other termination signal recieved.
