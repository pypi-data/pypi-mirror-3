Installation
=============

Do *not* just try to easy_install or pip install obdemo.  It has a lot
of specific dependencies which can't/shouldn't be captured by
setup.py.

Instead, see the full documentation at http://openblockproject.org/docs/install/index.html which includes links to pip requirements files
and instructions on preparing your system.
