ikaaro 0.62.3 (2010/11/04)
==========================

This is a Content Management System built on Python & itools, among
other features ikaaro provides:

 - content and document management (index&search, metadata, etc.)
 - multilingual user interfaces and content
 - high level modules: wiki, forum, tracker, etc.

Changes
-------

Two small new features have been added:

- the ability to extract the contents of archive files (ZIP, TAR) into
  the database

- the ability to restrict the roles that can be used in the tracker (to
  assign an issue to a user, or to set the CC file)

There are many small user interface improvements, like a better batch
interface (see bug #920).
