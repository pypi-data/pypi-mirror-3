Description: Welcome to Django on AppEngine!
        ===============================
        
        Motivation  to create  this project  was  the fact  of publication  by
        Google CloudSQL backend.  This library as  it is is not for production
        ready yet,  the same as  Google AppEngine  CloudSQL is not  ready for
        production as well being currently in development preview.
        
        Project originaly inspired by work  of Waldemar Kornewald and Thomas Wanschik
        from  `All  Buttons  Pressed <http://www.allbuttonspressed.com/projects/djangoappengine>`_,  some ideas  where  moved  from
        `djangoappengine <http://www.allbuttonspressed.com/projects/djangoappengine>`_  project.
