Description
===========

**Nagare** is an Open-Source framework, released under the BSD license,
dedicated to rich web applications development in Python.

*And Now For Something Completely Different*
--------------------------------------------

**Nagare** doesn't follow the statu quo established by the classic frameworks
of the Java, Python, Php and Ruby worlds:

  - no templating language
  - no explicit URL routing / mapping
  - no controllers proliferation
  - no manual management of the HTTP request / response cycles
  - no global session object
  - no REST by default
  
When you forget all of that, what do you get ?

  You get a powerful framework dedicated to web applications development, in
  opposition to simple content publishing.
 
  You get a truly component based framework where the application is a dynamic
  set of autonomous components, each one following its own independent control
  flow and maintaining its own private state.

  You get a framework where every web page is the composition of views from
  several components.

  You get a framework where the HTTP connectionless request / response cycle,
  the refresh, back and fork actions of the browser, don't break the normal
  control flow of the application.

  You get a framework with natively integrated Web 2.0 features.
  
  You get a framework where the web applications are developed in the same way
  as the desktop applications.

------------------------------------

Try it ! Play with it ! Adopt it !

And never look back.

--------

**Nagare** is the japanese word for "flow" or "smooth transition".

A reference to the control flow of an application, the name of the highest
creativity state of mind, and, in the "Ki no nagare" principle of martial arts,
the perfect association of energy and agility.
