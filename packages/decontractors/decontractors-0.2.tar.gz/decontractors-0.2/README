Decontractors: A Programming by Contract implementation using Decorators
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The implementation idea came to me while discussion Design by Contract
implementations (pyContract, pyDBC, ...) at the May 2011 meeting
of PyUGAT, the Python User Group Austria. Initial release: 2011-05-19

Python 3 support: This library has been tested with Python 3.2.2. You might
need to run the 2to3 utility to convert the sources, like this:

   2to3 -w decontractors.py examples/*.py

Thanks to the following people who provided valuable feedback:
