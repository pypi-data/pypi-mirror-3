Dynamodb-mapper -- a DynamoDB object mapper, based on boto.

Presentation
============

`DynamoDB <http://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/>`_ is a minimalistic NoSQL engine
provided by Amazon as a part of their AWS product.

**DynamoDB** allows you to stores documents composed of unicode strings or numbers
as well as sets of unicode strings and numbers. Each tables must define a hash
key and may define a range key. All other fields are optional.

**Dynamodb-mapper** brings a tiny abstraction layer over DynamoDB to overcome some
of the limitations with no performance compromise. It is highly inspired by the
mature `MoongoKit project <http://namlook.github.com/mongokit>`_

Requirements
============

The documentation currently assumes that you're running Boto 2.3.0 or later.
If you're not, then the API for query and scan changes. You will have to supply
raw condition dicts, as is done in boto itself.

Also note that Boto 2.3.1 or later is required for autoincrement_int hash keys.
Earlier versions will fail.

We assume you've correctly set your Boto credentials.

Example usage
=============


Quick install
-------------

::

    $ pip install dynamodb-mapper

If you have not yet configured Boto, you may simply

::

    $ export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<your id key here>
    $ export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<your secret key here>


First Model
-----------

::

    from dynamodb_mapper.model import DynamoDBModel


    class DoomMap(DynamoDBModel):
        __table__ = u"doom_map"
        __hash_key__ = u"episode"
        __range_key__ = u"map"
        __schema__ = {
            u"episode": int,
            u"map": int,
            u"name": unicode,
            u"cheats": set,
        }
        __defaults__ = {
            "cheats": set([u"Konami"]),
        }


Initial Table creation
----------------------

::

    conn = ConnectionBorg()
    conn.create_table(DoomMap, 10, 10, wait_for_active=True)


Model Usage
-----------

::

    e1m1 = DoomMap()
    e1m1.episode = 1
    e1m1.map = 1
    e1m1.name = u"Hangar"
    e1m1.cheats = set([u"idkfa", u"iddqd", u"idclip"])
    e1m1.save()


    # Later on, retrieve that same object from the DB...
    e1m1 = DoomMap.get(1, 1)

    # query all maps of episode 1
    e1_maps = DoomMap.query(hash_key=1)

    # query all maps of episode 1 with 'map' hash_key > 5
    from boto.dynamodb.condition import GT
    e1_maps_after_5 = DoomMap.query(
        hash_key=1,
        range_key_condition=GT(5))
