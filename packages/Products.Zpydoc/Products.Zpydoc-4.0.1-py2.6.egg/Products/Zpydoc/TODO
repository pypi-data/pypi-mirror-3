* push stylesheets through the default ZPT's

* a better implementation of Zope permissions - currently only permissions directly
  included in __ac_permissions__ is returned.  The SecurityManager declare* functions
  declarations need to be collected somehow.

* Product refresh gives an error in the utils::implementsMethod function - maybe this
  has something to do with reloading module into different memory address.  Moving
  this function into a class and using __setstate__ could fix this ...

* Provide a decent colour parser for source file syntax highlighting
