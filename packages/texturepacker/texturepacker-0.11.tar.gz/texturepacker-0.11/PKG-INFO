Description: Minecraft Texture-Pack Maker
        
        Purpose
        -------
        
        Texturepacker provides program ``maketexture`` for assembling
        texture packs for Minecraft using recipes written in a simple language
        expressed using JSON or as Python dicts, and a library of Python classes
        that can be used to do the same thing in your own programs.
        
        Texture packs can be created by combining image files in PNG format, or
        images extracted from existing texture packs. This enables you to remix
        texture packs to use alternative textures for some elements if the
        original artist included them, or even to combine textures from two or
        more separate packs. One use for this might be to upgrade a pack
        designed for an earlier version of Minecraft to work with newly added
        items.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Requirements:
        
        - Python 2.7
        - Distribute (or Setuptools might work)
        
        You should be able to install with the following command::
        
            $ python setup.py install
        
        You can test it worked by running it on an example recipe::
        
            $ maketexture -v examples/groovystipple.zip
        
        (These are included in the source distribution but will not be
        included in a binary install.)
        
        To run automated tests, you need to install 2 more packages and
        then use Nose::
        
            $ pip install nose mock
            $ nosetests tests
        
        This should print a lot of dots and then report OK at the end.
