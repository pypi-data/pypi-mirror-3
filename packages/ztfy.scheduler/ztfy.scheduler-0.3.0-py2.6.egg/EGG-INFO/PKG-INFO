        What is ztfy.scheduler ?
        ========================
        
        ztfy.scheduler is a base package for those which need to build scheduled tasks which can run inside
        a Zope3/Bluebream environment (ZEO is required !). These tasks can be scheduled:
        
         - on a cron-style base,
         - at a given date/time (like the "at" command)
         - or at a given interval.
        
        Scheduling is done through the APScheduler (http://packages.python.org/APScheduler/) package and
        so all these kinds of tasks can be scheduled with the same sets of settings. But tasks management
        is made through a simple web interface.
        
        Locks management allows the scheduler to be integrated in a multi-process environment (via file locks)
        or in a multi-hosts environment (via memcached locks), without the problem of tasks being run
        simultaneously by several processes.
        
        Tasks logs can be stored in the ZODB for a variable duration (based on a number of iterations).
        These log reports can also be sent by mail, on each run or only when errors are detected.
        
        
        How to use ztfy.scheduler ?
        ===========================
        
        A set of ztfy.scheduler usages are given as doctests in ztfy/scheduler/doctests/README.txt
        
        
        Known bugs
        ==========
        
         - Sometimes, deleting a task doesn't delete the matching job and the whole scheduler have to
           be restarted, generally via a whole server shutdown and restart.
        
        
        Changelog
        =========
        
        0.3.0
        -----
         - refactoring to follow last releases of ztfy.skin and ztfy.jqueryui packages
         - redefined interfaces so that tasks scheduling mode (cron-style,
           interval-style...) can be defined on a per-task basis and is not bound
           to the task class; new scheduling modes can also be added via registered
           utilities
         - store tasks execution log in tasks history
         - add an "URL getter" task, which can be used to call a remote "management"
           URL on periodic basis
         - add username/password/realm to ZEO connections
         - modify ZODB packer task to be able to pack another remote database
           instead of only those to which scheduler is defined
         - improved handling of transactions and conflict errors
