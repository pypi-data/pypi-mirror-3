Description: [Mozinstall](https://github.com/mozilla/mozbase/tree/master/mozinstall)
        is a python package for installing Mozilla applications on various platforms.
        
        For example, depending on the platform, Firefox can be distributed as a 
        zip, tar.bz2, exe or dmg file or cloned from a repository. Mozinstall takes the 
        hassle out of extracting and/or running these files and for convenience returns
        the full path to the application's binary in the install directory. In the case 
        that mozinstall is invoked from the command line, the binary path will be 
        printed to stdout.
        
        # Usage
        
        For command line options run mozinstall --help
        
        Mozinstall's main function is the install method
        
            import mozinstall
            mozinstall.install('path_to_install_file', dest='path_to_install_folder')
        
        The dest parameter defaults to the directory in which the install file is located.
        The install method accepts a third parameter called apps which tells mozinstall which 
        binary to search for. By default it will search for 'firefox', 'thunderbird' and 'fennec'
        so unless you are installing a different application, this parameter is unnecessary.
        
        # Dependencies
        
        Mozinstall depends on the [mozinfo](https://github.com/mozilla/mozbase/tree/master/mozinfo) 
        package which is also found in the mozbase repository.
