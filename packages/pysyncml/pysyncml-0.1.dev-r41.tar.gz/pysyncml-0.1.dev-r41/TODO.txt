Todo List
=========

* Use coverage to ensure that all code paths are tested in unit tests.
  OK, now that coverage has been added, bring that to 100%...

* If no logging is done, then configure the log subsystem for silence to
  avoid the "no logger configured" warning.

* The mapping table needs better management, e.g. if the peer store is
  rerouted, then all mappings should get dropped. There are more cases where
  the mappings will fall out of sync... rethink that.

* Make smarter determination of what syncmode to use during initialization.
  i.e. check last anchors with peer...

* Handle 508 (refresh-required) response to alert command.

* Soft deletes should be handled by the framework... one significant problem
  with this approach is that ID's may get recycled by the underlying agent,
  which would be a show-stopper.

* In server mode, set the "Target/LocName" to the current username, e.g.:
    <SyncML>
      <SyncHdr>
        <Target>
          <LocURI>IMEI:cc20f0e5-338b-42c1-8f51-137a15238892</LocURI>
          <LocName>USERNAME</LocName>
        </Target>
        ...

* Currently, the Adapter has a "peer" attribute that represents the peer that
  it is currently being synchronized with. This is good for ease-of-use, but
  bad when trying to re-use an Adapter either for multiple peers (i.e. for
  servers), or multiple synchronizations for clients. The current peer should
  become part of the "session" object or some other context-providing object.

* Implement conflict detection and handling, make sure that there is some
  kind of "policy" to control that.
