Description: runstatus - detect if a program is already running
        =============================================================
        
        Knowing if a program is already running can be useful in many situations.
        For example
        
        * avoid running operations that do not expect to be executed twice or more 
          simultaneously
        * improve the usability of a software so that the user does not end up having 
          multiple instances of the same program open at once.
        
        All of this in a cross-platform python library .
        
        The library is trivial to use::
        
            import runstatus
        
            if runstatus.already_running('myAppName'):
                print('do something, e.g. exiting')
                exit(0)
        
        The library comes with various functions:
        
        * ``already_running(codeName)`` tells you if this same program is running
          in a different process
        
        * ``get_system_start_time()`` will give you the time when the computer
          was turned on in unixtime
        
        * ``process_exists(pid)`` will tell you if a process with that id is
          running
        
        * ``process_kill(pid)`` will kill the process with that id if exists
