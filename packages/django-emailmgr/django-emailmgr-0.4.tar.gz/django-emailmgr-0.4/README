django-emailmgr
================

Django emailmgr is an application that helps with post registration email management".
``You can associate multiple email addresses to a single Django User.``

This application comes into the picture only after a user has been created, activated
and logged in.

If your requirements is for email management prior to user registration please take a 
look at ``django-registration`` or ``django-email-confirmation``.

This application was inspired by bitbucket.org's email management system as well as 
the mentioned applications.
