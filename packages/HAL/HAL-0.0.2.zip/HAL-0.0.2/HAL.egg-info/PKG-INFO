Description: =================
        The HAL AI Engine
        =================
        
        HAL is a matching AI engine that is designed to replace ALICE, Eliza, and
        like. It currently has three main backends: regex, matrix (or word index),
        and substring. It also has a few supplement backends: spam [1]_, oneword
        [2]_, and generic.
        
        Note that this is only a library, it doesn't have any fancy interfaces
        pre-installed. There is only one script, ``hal``.
        
        .. [1] detects keyboard spam and notify the user instead of giving
               a "I don't understand" response
        .. [2] *one*-word variant of matrix, designed to run after matrix, but in
               practice never used.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        To install, do: ``pip install HAL``.
        
        After install, run python in interactive mode and run ``import HAL.dbtest``.
        If it says you don't have fts (full-text search), then you should install
        the ``pysqlite2`` module from `here
        <http://code.google.com/p/pysqlite/downloads/list>`_.
        
        Now you need a dataset, the main set that I am developing is here:
        http://github.com/HALTeam/HALdata. Note that it was converted from an older
        version that I wrote a few months ago, which has only a regex engine. The
        dataset is based on the standard AIML set, which have a very different design
        compared to HAL. So I expect many bugs in the dataset, feel free to report
        them on GitHub.
