Using Wheelwright
=================

.. admonition:: Units

   Tensions are reported in `kilograms-force
   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram-force>`_ (kgf), a non-SI
   unit of force common in the bicycle industry.

   1 kgf = 9.81 N

Starting Wheelwright
--------------------

Click on the Wheelwright icon or use the ``wheelwright`` command to
start the application.

Specifying information about your wheel
---------------------------------------

First off, you need to set some information about your wheel.

* **Spoke Type**: Find your spokes in the pull-down menu. For butted spokes, use the smallest diameter.
* **Target Tension**: Ideally, this number should come from the rim manufacturer. For most rims 110 kgf is a good target. Some manufacturers recommend slightly tighter spokes for the rear wheel, for example, 115 kgf.
* **Target Accuracy**: This is the accuracy you choose for your wheel. For a target tension of 100 kgf, an accuracy of 0.10 means that tensions between 90--110 kgf will be considered in-spec. (This in-spec region is shown as a green band in the plots.)
* **Number of Spokes**: This is the number of spokes on each side of the wheel. Wheelwright assumes this is the same on each side.

Entering spoke tensions
-----------------------

Now you are ready to enter the tension of each spoke.

Pick a spoke and go around entering the deflection reading from Park
Tool's TM-1 tension meter. Wheelwright does the conversion to
kilograms-force.

.. admonition:: Interpolation accuracy

   Wheelwright interpolates to find the tension (in kgf) for a given
   TM-1 deflection reading. Like all interpolations, this can be quite
   poor outside of the calibration range. Especially for small
   deflection readings (less than 10), the interpolated tension
   shouldn't be trusted.

Which spokes you choose to call the *right* and *left* doesn't really
matter, although you might as well choose the drive- and
non-drive-side spokes, respectively. Also, where you start (spoke #1)
isn't important, but starting at the valve hole is a convenient way to
keep the spokes straight.

For a dished wheel --- such as a rear wheel or a front wheel with a
disc-brake hub --- the tension will be higher on one side. You want
the higher tension side to be within spec. Whatever tension the
non-dished side ends up at isn't important as long as it's roughly
uniform and the wheel is trued and dished.

Spoke tension plot
------------------

The primary result Wheelwright produces is the spoke tension plot in
the main window.

The spoke tension is shown for both the right (in blue) and left
(maroon) spokes on the wheel. The spoke are numbered
counter-clockwise. If you started with spoke #1 at the valve hole,
it's easy to locate a particular spoke.

Spokes that are in-spec (within the chosen target accuracy) are inside
the green region. Out-of-spec spokes are also marked by a red square.

The dashed lines designate the average tension. The dished side of the
wheel should be close to the target tension, and it's pretty close in
this example.

For this wheel, the left spokes are higher in tension than those on
the right. This is typical of a front wheel with a disc-brake hub. The
opposite is true for rear wheels, where the right (drive-side) spokes
have the higher tension.

Five spokes are out-of-spec in this example; there are five red
squares along the maroon curve. The largest errors appear to come from
the spokes #13 (at low tension) and #15 (high tension). Radial truing
will usually reign these in, so there is clearly more work that can be
done on this wheel.

Tension meter calibration plot
------------------------------

From the ``View`` menu select ``Show Tension Meter Calibration`` to
open a window showing the TM-1's calibration data for the chosen
spokes.

The vertical green line is the deflect reading corresponding to the
target tension. This is what you are aiming for on the TM-1 tension
meter. In this case, a reading of 21.5 would be perfect, and anything
between 19.5 and 23 is within the chosen accuracy. (Round the numbers
to the nearest half, which is about as good as you can read off the
TM-1.)

Notice the curve is non-linear. As your spokes get higher in tension,
small turns of your spoke wrench can really increase the tension
rapidly!

Generating a report
-------------------

From the ``Tools`` menu select ``Generate Report`` to save a PDF
report of the wheel.

Here is an :download:`example report <report.pdf>`.

This could be given to a customer to quantify the quality of the wheel
you built, or just hung on your refrigerator for giggles.

The first page shows the spoke tension plot, and the second page has a
table with numerical tensions for each spoke.


Customizing the report
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can add a header to the report by creating a configuration file
named ``wheelwright.cfg`` or ``.wheelwright`` in your home directory.

Modify the ``header`` variable in the ``Report`` section, as in the
following example.

.. literalinclude:: wheelwright.cfg
   :language: python

Saving your work
----------------

In the ``File`` menu you can ``Save`` your your work to ``Open`` it
later.
