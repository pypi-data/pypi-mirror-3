    With TurboGears Interface, the developer can write client code as if he 
    were writing it on the server with direct access to server-side models 
    and methods.
    
    It uses the most-excellent TGWebServices package to do the heavy lifting.
    Unfortunately, the latest egg doesn't seem to work so you'll need to 
    install TGWebServices with mercurial
    (``hg clone https://code.google.com/p/tgws.tgws-2/``) in the TurboGears 
    virtualenv (ie. server-side).
    
    Thanks to all who contributed to TGWebServices and TurboGears (and all
    packages contained therein).
    
    Thanks also to Frank v. Delft for his brain farts and SGC (http://www.thesgc.org/)
    for their support.

    
    Features
    --------
    Server-side:
    
     * Works seamlessly with TurboGears
     * Gives access to models and methods that you decorate
     * API automatically created and offered for download
     * If you expose a model and don't create a controller, one is created for you
     * Methods defined in Controllers automatically import and export complex types defined in the API
     * (Optional) Methods can change 'self' to be the the 'self' object that initiated the call client-side


    Client-side:
    
     * Automatically provides access to methods and models defined in the API
     * Code looks identical to server-side code (using SQLAlchemy's ORM)
     * Automatically guesses database relationships to keep client-data up-to-date
     * All calls are made asynchronously and the module is multithread-safe
     * Allows the developer to easily define callback functions for data being updated or server-side methods finishing

    To-do
    -----
    Server-side:
    
     * Implement autherisation in ``ServerSide.ExposeTable`` (should be easy enough to integrate TurboGear's autherisation system)

    Client-side:
    
     * Make it easy to gracefully tell the user of network outage / server error (at the moment, the developer can make error handlers for specific things going wrong, but there's probably a better way to let him know of general faults affecting many systems.)
