Description: Three sides of Mordor were bounded by mountain ranges, arranged in a rough
        rectangle: Ered Lithui, translated as 'Ash Mountains' in the north, Ephel
        Duath, translated as 'Fence of Shadow' in the west, and an unnamed (or was
        possibly still called Ephel Duath) range in the south. In the northwest corner
        of Mordor, the deep valley of Udun formed the region's gate and guard house.
        That was the only entrance for large armies, and was where Sauron built the
        Black Gate of Mordor, and later where Gondor built the Towers of the Teeth.
        Behind the Black Gate, these towers watched over Mordor during the time of
        peace between the Last Alliance and Sauron's return. In front of the Morannon
        lay the Dagorlad or the Battle Plain.
