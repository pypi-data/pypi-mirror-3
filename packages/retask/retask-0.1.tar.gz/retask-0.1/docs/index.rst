Retask: simple Task Queue
=============================
retask is a python module to create and manage distributed task queues.

It uses `Redis <http://redis.io>`_ to create task queues. User can enqueue
and dequeue tasks in the queues they manage. Each task can contain any 
serializable python objects. We use `JSON` internally to store the tasks
in the queues.

Dependencies
------------
- python-redis
- mock
- A running Redis server
