Installation Instructions
=========================

Binary packages for various platforms are available at:

    http://htsql.org/download.html

To install HTSQL from source, download the latest source package from:

    http://pypi.python.org/pypi/HTSQL/

Unpack the archive and run::

    # make install

HTSQL requires database adapters for each supported database backend.
To install all the adapters, run::

    # make install-deps

Installing HTSQL creates a ``htsql-ctl`` script.  For general help and
a list of commands, run::

    $ htsql-ctl help

To start a command-line HTSQL shell, run::

    $ htsql-ctl shell DBURI

To start an HTTP server running HTSQL, run::

    $ htsql-ctl server DBURI [HOST [PORT]]

Here, ``DBURI`` specifies how to connect to the database and must have
the form::

    ENGINE://USER:PASS@HOST:PORT/DATABASE
