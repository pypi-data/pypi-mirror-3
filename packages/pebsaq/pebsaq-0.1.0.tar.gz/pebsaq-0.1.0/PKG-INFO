        Installing
        ==========
        
        Way #1
        ------
        Just run this (requires that you have python-setuptools installed)::
        
          $ sudo easy_install pebsaq
        
        Way #2
        ------
        Get the newest version of pebsaq at
        http://metanohi.name/projects/pebsaq/ or at
        http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pebsaq
        
        Extract the downloaded file and run this in a terminal::
        
          # python setup.py install
        
        Dependencies
        ============
        
        Python 2.4+ is probably a requirement. In any case, it does not work with
        Python 3.
        
        ``pyalsaaudio``
         + Web address: http://pyalsaaudio.sourceforge.net/
         + License: Python Software License
         + Installing:
        
           + In general: ``$ sudo easy_install pyalsaaudio`` (requires
             ``libasound2-dev`` and ``python-dev``)
           + On DEB-based distributions: ``$ sudo apt-get install python-alsaaudio``
           + On RPM-based distributions: ``$ sudo yum install python-alsaaudio``
           + On other distributions: probably something similar
         + Author: Casper Wilstrup <cwi at aves dk>
        
        ``pygame``
         + Web address: http://www.pygame.org/
         + License: GNU Lesser General Public License
         + Installing:
        
           + In general: ``$ sudo easy_install pygame``
           + On DEB-based distributions: ``$ sudo apt-get install python-pygame``
           + On RPM-based distributions: ``$ sudo yum install pygame``
           + On other distributions: probably something similar
        
        ``qvikconfig``
         + Web address: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/qvikconfig/
         + License: GPLv3+
         + Installing: ``$ sudo easy_install qvikconfig``
         + Author: Niels G. W. Serup
        
        Note that ``qvikconfig`` is included with pebsaq, so you don't really
        have to install it.
        
        Optional extras
        ---------------
        If present, pebsaq will also use these Python modules:
        
        ``termcolor``
         + Web address: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/termcolor/
         + License: GPLv3+
         + Installing: ``$ sudo easy_install termcolor``
         + Author: Konstantin Lepa <konstantin lepa at gmail com>
        
        Note that ``termcolor`` is included with pebsaq, so you don't
        really have to install it.
         
        ``setproctitle``
         + Web address: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setproctitle/
         + License: New BSD License
         + Installing: ``$ sudo easy_install setproctitle``
         + Author: Daniele Varrazzo <daniele varrazzo at gmail com>
        
        
        Using
        =====
        
        Running ``pebsaq`` with no arguments will start the utility in
        interactive mode. In interactive mode you can interactively change the
        frequency and the strengths of the waves. A nice wave will also be
        drawn to the screen.
        
        Running ``pebsaq --help`` will show a list of available command-line
        options. These options can also be specified in config files. Config
        files use a ``property = value`` syntax (e.g. ``frequency = 367`` or
        ``square strength = 2``) separated by newlines.
        
        Press 3 to decrease the frequency by 10Hz.
        Press 6 to increase the frequency by 10Hz.
        Press down arrow key to decrease the amplitude by 0.1.
        Press down arrow key to increase the amplitude by 0.1.
        Press 1 to decrease the sine strength by 1.
        Press 2 to increase the sine strength by 1.
        Press 4 to decrease the square strength by 1.
        Press 5 to increase the square strength by 1.
        Press 7 to decrease the triangle strength by 1.
        Press 8 to increase the triangle strength by 1.
        Press 0 to mute pebsaq.
        Press ESC to exit pebsaq.
