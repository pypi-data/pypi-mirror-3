Description: 
        stompclient provides a simple and lighweight STOMP client API for Python. 
        
        stompclient supports both simplex (publisher-only) and duplex (publish-subscribe)
        communication with STOMP servers. This project started as a fork of the `stompy
        project by Benjamin W. Smith <https://bitbucket.org/asksol/python-stomp>`_) but 
        has evolved into a very distinct codebase, which combines a few ideas from 
        stompy with features from the Stomper library and CoilMQ broker.
        
        Changes in 0.3.2

        * Merged change from bmentges to use tests_require instead of install_requires
          (issue 6).
