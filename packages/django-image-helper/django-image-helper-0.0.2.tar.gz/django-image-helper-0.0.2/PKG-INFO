Description: 
        Django Image Helper
        
        Provides a model mixin that has 'image' and 'thumbnail' fields.
        The uploaded image will be scaled to the model's 'IMAGE_SIZE' and
        a thumbnail will be scaled and saved to the model's 'THUMBNAIL_SIZE'.
        
        Additionally, there is an admin mixin to help you display an image's thumbnail
        when in the admin's listview.
