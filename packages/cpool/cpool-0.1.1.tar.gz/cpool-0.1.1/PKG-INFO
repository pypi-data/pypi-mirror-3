Description: =====================
        Simple Connecton Pool
        =====================
        
        A simple connection pool handler that maintains a pool of connection objects
        (of whatever type you specify) attached to each thread.
        
        This was designed for managing oursql database connections in a thread-safe
        manner (under a multithreaded wsgi server) but will work for anything that
        needs a thread-safe connection manager.
        
        Sample usage
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        ::
        
            from mylibrary import MyConnectionClass
            from cpool import Pool
        
            PoolFactory = Pool(MyConnectionClass)
            PoolFactory.configure(host = 'myhost', port = '12345')
            conn = PoolFactory()
            conn.do_comething()
