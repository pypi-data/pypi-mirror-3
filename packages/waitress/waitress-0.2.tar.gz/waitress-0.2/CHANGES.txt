Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- Set up logging by calling logging.basicConfig() when ``serve`` is called
  (show tracebacks and other warnings to console by default).

- Disallow WSGI applications to set "hop-by-hop" headers (Connection,
  Transfer-Encoding, etc).

- Don't treat 304 status responses specially in HTTP/1.1 mode.

- Remove out of date ``interfaces.py`` file.

- Normalize logging (all output is now sent to the ``waitress`` logger rather
  than in degenerate cases some output being sent directly to stderr).

Features
~~~~~~~~

- Support HTTP/1.1 ``Transfer-Encoding: chunked`` responses.

- Slightly better docs about logging.
