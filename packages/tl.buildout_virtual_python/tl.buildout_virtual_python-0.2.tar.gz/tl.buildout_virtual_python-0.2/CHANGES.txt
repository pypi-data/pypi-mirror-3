=========================================
Change log for tl.buildout_virtual_python
=========================================

0.2 (2012-01-27)
================

- changed the implementation to make use of the ``virtualenv`` package,
  obsoleting the ``headers`` option and adding a package dependency on
  ``virtualenv``

- added the ``interpreter`` option for creating a Python interpreter by the
  given name in the buildout's ``bin`` directory, overtaking part of the
  ``executable-name`` option's effect

- moved project to Mercurial with new Bitbucket home at
  <https://bitbucket.org/tlotze/tl.buildout_virtual_python/>


0.1.3 (2008-08-21)
==================

Features:
  - added an option to install eggs into the newly created Python

Organisation:
  - moved project in Subversion to
    <https://svn.thomas-lotze.de/repos/public/tl.buildout_virtual_python/>
  - added some tests


0.1.2 (2007-11-20)
==================

Bug fixes:
  - added a stub update method to silence the buildout complaint
  - in setup.py, fixed path to glob for text files

Clean-up:
  - don't copy real Python path to another option as we don't seriously expect
    this to get broken


0.1.1 (2007-06-09)
==================

Bug fixes:
  - actually export the options promised
  - handle the extra-paths option correctly
