Guidelines

* Create issues, preferably before starting to hack, so that we can discuss as
  soon as possible.
* Work in branches, ideally one branch per issue.
* Write tests and run them with ``make test``.
* Write documentation in :file:`docs/`. Build it with ``make documentation``.
* Update the demo project in :file:`demo/`.
