Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This package integrates documentcloud's viewer and pdf processing
        into plone.
        
        Example viewer: https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/19864-goldman-sachs-internal-emails
        
        Besides displaying PDFs, it will also display:
        
         - Word
         - Excel
         - Powerpoint
         - HTML
         - RTF
        
        
        Install requirements
        --------------------
        
         - docsplit: http://documentcloud.github.com/docsplit/
         - graphicsmagick
         - ghostscript
         - poppler
         - tesseract
         - pdftk
         - openoffice(for doc, excel, ppt, etc types)
        
        
        Async Integration
        -----------------
        
        It it highly recommended to install and configure plone.app.async
        in combination with this package. Doing so will manage all pdf
        conversions processes asynchronously so the user isn't delayed
        so much when saving files.
        
        
        Settings
        --------
        
        The product can be configured via a control panel item
        `Document Viewer Settings`.
        
        Some interesting configuration options:
        
        Storage Type
            If you want to be able to serve you files via amazon cloud, 
            this will allow you to store the data in flat files that
            can be synced to another server.
        Storage Location
            Where are the server to store the files.
        OCR
            Use tesseract to scan the document for text. This process ca be
            slow so if your pdfs do not need to be OCR'd, you may disable.
        Auto Select Layout
            For pdf files added to the site, automatically select the
            document viewer display.
        Auto Convert
            When pdf files are added and modified, automatically convert.
        
        
        TODO
        ----
        
         - add text back to pdf(necessary?)
           - slow...
         - remove images after file is deleted for plain file storage
         - take hash of file to compare if it's already converted
