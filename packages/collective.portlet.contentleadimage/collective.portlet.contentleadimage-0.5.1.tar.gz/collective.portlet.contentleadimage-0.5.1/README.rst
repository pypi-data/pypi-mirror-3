Introduction
============

This portlet behaves like collection portlet, but shows the
contentleadimages and the title of each item. If the item has no lead
image but has a image field (like News Items, for example) then this field
is displayed.

This portlet has an extra option to display start dates instead of
publication dates.

Another extra option can be used to choose the scale of the images.

To install just add collective.portlet.contentleadimage to your buildout's
eggs and go to the products section of Plone's control panel.
