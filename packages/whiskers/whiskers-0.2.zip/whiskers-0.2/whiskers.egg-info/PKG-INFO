Description: Whiskers
        ========
        
        "Vibrissae (singular: vibrissa), or whiskers, are specialized hairs (or, in
        certain bird species, specialized feathers) usually employed for tactile
        sensation." - Wikipedia
        
        Whiskers is a Pyramid application for storing information about your buildouts.
        It is intended to use with buildout.sendpickedversions (PyPI_, Github_)
        extension.
        
        Reason behind Whiskers
        ----------------------
        
        Why? Shortly to automate your workflow.
        
        Think an environment where you're managing tens or hundereds of buildouts - say
        Plone instances. Most of them have probably almost same packages and almost same
        versions. Now you make an critical fix to some custom package and you need to
        know which buildouts you have to update. Whikers helps you here by knowing what
        is required and where.
        
        Installation using virtualenv
        -----------------------------
        
        ::
        
        virtualenv whiskers --no-site-packages
        cd whiskers
        bin/pip install whiskers
        wget https://github.com/pingviini/whiskers/raw/master/production.ini
        bin/pserve production.ini
        
        Future
        ------
        
        Whiskers is currently just storing buildout information. Future
        plans involve at least following features:
        
        * Have a buildout history so you can follow what packages have
        been updated, added or removed.
