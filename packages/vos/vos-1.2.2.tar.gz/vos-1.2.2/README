cadcVOFS is filesystem client for access the CADC VOSpace webservice.  

This client uses the python binders on the FUSE library.

Requirements: 
	       A CADC VOSpace account
	       fuse (likely fuse-devel) installed 
	       fuse kernel bindings (part of Linux 2.4 and newer)
	       python2.6 or newer.

There isn't much in here that depends on 2.6.


Install:


sudo python setup.py install

Usage:

mountvofs vos:VOSPACE /mountPoint

Help:
mountvofs --help 

options like -v and -d provide lots of feedback.

--- Note: by default mountvofs will create a cache of your VOSpace at
    the location ${HOME}/vos:VOSPACE where VOSPACE is the name of your
    VOSpace. You can change this default location and the size of the
    cache from the command line.
