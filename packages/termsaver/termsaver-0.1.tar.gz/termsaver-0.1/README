----------
Background
----------

The motivation behind this project is basically pure boredom (laughs). 
Seriously, it may look like nonsense to have a screensaver look-alike program
running on a terminal window. Nonetheless, sometimes, we still want to see some
kind of movement, or action on the screen... which invigorates one's state of
mind and helps concentration back to the black screen (well, some people like 
it white, meh!).

If you are:

  * looking for some extra display on your main terminal window, to keep the 
    screen busy while you are up to something else; or
  * looking for some distractions that may entertain you after too many hours
    in front of the terminal; or
  * with plenty of screen space (so long 80x25 default terminal window! long 
    live 1920px...), and use many terminals on screen; or
  * just wanting to pretend you are busy with something (this is terrible)

then, TermSaver is the **right** application for you.


------------
Requirements
------------

  * Linux, or Mac
  * Python 2.4+ (and < 3.x)

**Note**: Windows support is in the roadmap.


------------

------------

document, here is the installation procedure, plain and simple:

1. Download the Source here_:

2. Unpack it

3. Install it

Features
--------

The TermSaver is a very simple application, built with the idea to allow more 
screensavers to be added to its core. Developers, please read the section below. 

The current published screensavers are:

Ascii Art Farts
---------------

This is a screensaver that displays ascii art from asciiartfarts.com 
RSS feed in an animation format. 

Dot
---

A extremely simple screensaver, created more with the idea to guide developers 
on how to use the termsaver libraries to build their own, and help grow the 
termsaver screensaver gallery in future.

This screensaver only displays a running dot that appears in random locations 
and sizes.

Jokes For All
-------------

This is a screensaver that displays recent jokes from http://jokes4all.net
website, from its hourly updated RSS_ feed.

Request for Change

This is a screensaver that fetches documents from RFC (Request for Comments)
in visual animation, which are documents elaborated by the  Internet 
Engineering Task Force, available at http://tools.ietf.org/rfc/. This 
screensaver randomizes documents to display, from a list of latest valid
documents. See more information about this in Wikipedia_.

screensavers for termsaver will be available soon.

Roadmap
-------

There is no current roadmap defined, besides improvement tickets created in
Issues_ tab in GitHub.

Translation
-----------

The internationalization of this application follows same standards of most
applications out there, by using *gettext* and MO/PO files.

The translation is still being finished up, and when it is ready for 
contributor calls, we will post detailed information about the procedure.

Let us know you want to help: support@termsaver.info


Screensavers (plugin)
---------------------

As of this moment, all screensavers are part of the termsaver library, but it
was initially designed to predict the implementation of additional screensavers
as plug-ins to the main application. 

This is, however, not fully defined, so feel free to start now by forking this
code and implementing it directly inside termsaver. Your contribution will be
reflected in the list of authors of this application.
