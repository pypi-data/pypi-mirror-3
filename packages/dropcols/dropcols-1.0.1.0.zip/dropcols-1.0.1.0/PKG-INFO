Description: ``dropcols.py`` is a Python module and program
        that removes (or conversely, extracts)
        selected columns from a delimited text file, such as a CSV file. It is analogous
        to the *nix "cut" program, except that it works on CSV files and allows columns
        to be selected by name (regular expressions) in addition to by number. Either the
        columns to keep, or the columns to remove, or both, can be specified.
