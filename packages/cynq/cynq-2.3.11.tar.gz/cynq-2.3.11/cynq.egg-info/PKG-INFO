Description: cynq
        ====
        
        cynq is a core framework to aide in syncing of remote data stores.
        
        You are able to sync 1 or many remote sources of data with a local source.  
        It takes care of bidirectional syncing for you so you don't have to worry
        about it.
        
        still more work to be done to make this completely client friendly, but it
        is viable as it exists today
        
        still lots more docs to add
        
        TODO: add docs so someone else can grok (or I can grok after a couple months off)
