Description: ========================================================
        GLIMPSE - The General Layer-wise IMage ProceSsing Engine
        ========================================================
        
        The GLIMPSE project is a library for implementing hierarchical visual models in
        C++ and Python. The goal of this project is to allow a broad range of
        feed-forward, hierarchical models to be encoded in a high-level declarative
        manner, with low-level details of the implementation hidden from view. GLIMPSE
        combines an efficient implementation with the ability to leverage parallel
        processing facilities and is designed to run on multiple operating systems using
        only common, freely-available components. A prototype of GLIMPSE has been used
        to encode an HMAX-like model, achieving results comparable with those found in
        the literature.
        
        The GLIMPSE library began as a port of the Petascale Artificial Neural Network
        project [1]_, and owes a great deal to that work. Additionally, we acknowledge
        NSF Grant 1018967 (PIs: Melanie Mitchell and Garrett Kenyon) for support.
