        Python bindings for SpinRewriter API
        ====================================
        
        `Spin Rewriter <http://www.spinrewriter.com/bigcontentsearch>`_ is an online
        service for spinning text (synonym substitution) that creates unique version(s)
        of existing text. This package provides a way to easily interact with
        `SpinRewriter API <http://www.spinrewriter.com/api>`_. Usage requires an
        account, `get one here <http://www.spinrewriter.com/registration>`_.
