There is entry box on the main Task LIst Browser (it's left of the Add button, hard to miss.)  You can enter new tasks there.

Tasks can be assigned to projects like this:

"taskhelm - Contribute something back to taskhelm."

The word before the '-' becomes the project name.  Note that spaces are not allowed in project names.
