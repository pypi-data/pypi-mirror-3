ikaaro 0.62.1 (2010/08/26)
==========================

This is a Content Management System built on Python & itools, among
other features ikaaro provides:

 - content and document management (index&search, metadata, etc.)
 - multilingual user interfaces and content
 - high level modules: wiki, forum, tracker, etc.

Changes
-------

The edit view has been improved; most visible: now it is possible to
select what fields are to be edited with a form in the right column.

The "commit_log" and "changes" views have been much optimized, they
run at least twice faster than before.  These views allow to see the
contents of the database transactions (Git commits).

Now the access and event logs rotates automatically, once every three
weeks.

Several bugs have been fixed, including:

 #578 The div "location" break the layout under IEx
 #777 Language negotiation does not work properly with title field...
 #855 Bug in translation of PO resource
 #947 Fix spelling of the word "attachment"
