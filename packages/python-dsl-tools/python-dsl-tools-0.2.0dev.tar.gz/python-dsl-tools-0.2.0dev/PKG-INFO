Description: Helpers for creating Domain Specific Languages (a.k.a. pretty APIs) embedded in Python
        
        currently contains:
        
            - a function to create DeclarativeMetaClasses
            - a base class/mixin to save kwargs passed to init on the object
            - a classinstancemethod decorator, which allows an instancemethod
              to be called on an uninstantiated class by automatically creating
              an instance.
        
        
        TODO
        
        At the moment, classinstancemethod just instantiates the class with no
        parameters, but ideally it should be possible to pass it args and kwargs
        with which to instantiate.
