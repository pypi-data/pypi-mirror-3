Description: Overview
        ========
        
        Eye provides a browser-based UI to browse the contents of a ZODB database.
        
        .. image:: https://github.com/davisagli/eye/raw/master/screenshot.png
        
        It can browse "broken" ZODB objects, so you don't have to have your
        application code present in the Python environment to use the tool.
        
        It can also be used as a generic Python object browser.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        At this point Eye has been tested on Python 2.6.
        
        Eye has a few dependencies. Therefore it's recommended to install it in a
        virtualenv or buildout to keep it isolated from other software on your system.
        
        Assuming you have virtualenv installed, the following commands will install Eye::
        
          $ virtualenv --no-site-packages eye
          $ cd eye
          $ bin/pip install eye
        
        This creates a new virtualenv in the ``eye`` directory, and installs the ``eye``
        console script into the ``bin`` subdirectory.
        
        Basic usage
        -----------
        
        Inspect a ZODB filestorage
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        ::
        
          $ bin/eye [path to Data.fs]
        
        Then open your browser to http://localhost:8080/
        
        Persistent objects are shown in blue; other objects included in the pickles of
        persistent objects are shown in black.
        
        Inspect an arbitrary object
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        ::
        
          >>> from datetime import datetime
          >>> foo = datetime.now()
          >>> import eye; eye.eye(foo)
