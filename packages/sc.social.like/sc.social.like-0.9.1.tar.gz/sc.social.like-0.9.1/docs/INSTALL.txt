sc.social.like Installation
===========================

To install sc.social.like into the global Python environment (or a workingenv),
using a traditional Zope 2 instance, you can do this:

 * When you're reading this you have probably already run 
   ``easy_install sc.social.like``. Find out how to install setuptools
   (and EasyInstall) here:
   http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall

 * If you are using Zope 2.9 (not 2.10), get `pythonproducts`_ and install it 
   via::

       python setup.py install --home /path/to/instance

   into your Zope instance.

 * Create a file called ``sc.social.like-configure.zcml`` in the
   ``/path/to/instance/etc/package-includes`` directory.  The file
   should only contain this::

       <include package="sc.like" />

.. _pythonproducts: http://plone.org/products/pythonproducts


Alternatively, if you are using zc.buildout and the plone.recipe.zope2instance
recipe to manage your project, you can do this:

 * Add ``sc.social.like`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.:
 
    [buildout]
    ...
    eggs =
        ...
        sc.social.like
  * Not is necessary tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug.
  
  * Re-run buildout, e.g. with:
  
    $ ./bin/buildout
