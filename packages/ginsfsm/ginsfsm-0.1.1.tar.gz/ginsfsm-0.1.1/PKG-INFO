Description: GinsFSM
        =======
        
        GinsFSM is a python library to develop systems based in finite-state machines
        (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine).
        This model is really useful when writing networking and communication
        applications.
        
        The idea is very simple:
        
            * All objects, called `gobj`, are instances of a derived
              `ginsfsm.gobj.GObj` class, that we call `gclass`.
            * The `gclass` has an inner `simple-machine`
              that defines its behavior.
            * The communication between `gobj`'s happens via `event`'s.
        
        Thus, the nature of this system is fully asynchronous and event-driven.
        
        The interface is simple and common to all objects; you just have to change the
        name of the event and the data they carry.
