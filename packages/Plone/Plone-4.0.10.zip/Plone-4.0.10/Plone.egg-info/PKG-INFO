        aims to be *the* open source out-of-the-box publishing system.
        
        What is Plone?
        --------------
        
        Plone is a ready-to-run content management system that is built on the powerful
        and free Zope application server. Plone is easy to set up, extremely flexible,
        and provides you with a system for managing web content that is ideal for

          and tools exist for managing multilingual content.
        
        - *Plone is standard.* Plone carefully follows standards for usability and
          accessibility. Plone pages are compliant with US Section 508, and the W3C's
          AAA rating for accessibility.

        Technical overview
        ------------------
        
        Plone is a content management framework that works hand-in-hand and sits on top
        of Zope, a widely-used Open Source web application server and development
        system. To use Plone, you don't need to learn anything about Zope; to develop
        new Plone content types, a small amount of Zope knowledge is helpful, and it is
        covered in the `documentation`_.
        
        Zope itself is written in Python, an easy-to-learn, widely-used and supported
        Open Source programming language. Python can be used to add new features to
        Plone, and used to understand or make changes to the way that Zope and Plone
        work.
        
        By default, Plone stores its contents in Zope's built in transactional object
        database, the ZODB. There are products and techniques, however, to share
        information with other sources, such as relational databases, LDAP, filesystem
        files, etc.
        
        Plone runs on Windows, Linux, BSD, Mac OS X, and many other platforms;
        double-click installers are available for Windows and Mac OS X, and RPM
        packages are available for Linux. For full information, see the
        `plone.org product page`_.

          [hannosch]
        
        - No longer mention `textile` as a supported markup style. We don't ship with

          [hannosch]

        4.0b5 - 2010-07-07
        ------------------
        
        - Don't show the site's logo on the upgrade screen. Trying to render it can
          cause problems on not yet upgraded sites.
          [hannosch]
        
        - No longer show relevance percentage numbers in search results. What matters
          to users is the search results order; the numbers are meaningless.
          [hannosch]
        
        - No longer include a searchterm parameter in the query string when linking
          from the search results page, as it will be picked up from the referer.
          [davisagli]
        
        - Fix the highlightsearchterms script to not apply highlighting within
          textareas, to avoid data loss. Fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10573
          [davisagli]
        
        - Improved comment display and behavior: Now opens "Add comment" in an
          overlay, no longer insists on a Subject for every comment, and more readable
          layout. Also improved the error messages.
          [limi]
        
        - Switching the default modal window effect to be a white-out instead of a
          darkened effect. With large windows, the darkening is very distracting, and
          it also reminds people of the UAC prompts from Windows Vista/7, which is not
          a good thing. ;)
          [limi]
        
        - Removing action links from Events, since they are in the template (and were
          never supposed to have actions in the first place). This fixes
          http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10540.
          [limi]
        
        - Better icon for the theme control panel. (Thanks, Tango!)
          [limi]
        
        - Added normalizeString to the Plone view interface, where the declaration was
          missing.
          [davisagli]
        
        - Add a contenttype class to the items listed in select_default_page.cpt, so

        - Make the jQueryTools overlay configuration options in popupforms.js be

        4.0b4 - 2010-06-03
        ------------------
        
        - Fix FactoryTool to mangle REQUEST.BASEn correctly.
          [elro]
        
        - Updated the description_user_management default message in
          plone_deprecated/prefs_users_overview.cpt to be the same as
          plone/app/controlpanel/usergroups_usersoverview.pt
          [vincentfretin]
        
        - Ensure text is shown for the various Collection views. This fixes

        - Set the correct meta_type for files and images.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Removed the Large Plone Folder portal_type and LargePloneFolder class.
          Instead, use a normal ATFolder from plone.app.folder, with its ``ordering``
          attribute set to u'unordered'. Existing Large Plone Folders will get
          migrated when upgrading from older versions of Plone.
          [davisagli]
        
        - Removed empty HTML tags from listings when an item in the listing has no
          description.

        - Remove deprecated IndexIterator class and tabindex html attribute
          [edegoute]
        
        - Use a mask to visually highlight modal overlays. Configurable in
          popupforms.js. Set a common set of configuration options, defaulting
          to overlays that use absolute positioning.
          [smcmahon]
        
        - Update the ZMI security tab warning so it doesn't display outside of a Plone
          site.  This fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10521.
          [davisagli]
        
        - Get configlet icons directly from the action, rather than using the
          getIconFor helper.  This breaks the backwards-compatible fallback to the
          action icons tool, but avoids re-evaluating all action conditions for each
          configlet.
          [davisagli]
        
        - Report expiration of password resets for registration as an absolute time,
          rather than a number of hours.

        4.0b3 - 2010-05-03
        ------------------
        
        - "(Requires Javascript)" is now translatable in accessibility-info.pt.

          [vincentfretin]
        
        - Revert changes from changeset 34269, which prevented the calendar widget
          from properly saving results. Add another hidden field for the purposes
          of handling the label's for attribute.
          Fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10450
          [esteele]
        
        - Update capitalization of i18n:translate-d tags in deprecated templates to
          avoid i18ndude warnings on new templates.
          [esteele]
        
        - Updated default_error_message.pt to provide a better 404 Error page as per

          [cwainwright, dunlapm]
        
        - Fixed newsitem_view to not render the caption if the field is empty.
          [limi]
        
        - Moved old GIF variants of the icons to plone_deprecated, since Plone itself
          uses the PNG variants now.
          [limi]
        
        - Added touch_icon.png for iPhone/iPad home screen support.
          [limi]
        
        - Fixed clipped icons for most of the content type sprites by centralizing the
          definitions and setting line-height to 2em. There's still an issue where
          tal:replace="structure item_icon/html_tag" renders an img tag without src or
          points to the root, which makes the layout have an empty element. Probably
          needs to be fixed in the html_tag expression (e.g. if there isn't anything
          there, don't render). Should be good enough for beta3, but needs to be fixed
          before RC. See LiveSearch results + Advanced Workflow + Collection view
          (e.g. "Events") for examples of this. References

        - Don't take values directly from the request in ``getFolderContents``.
          request.form can include arbitrary data and request.other contains a whole
          lot of data, which isn't valid catalog indexes.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Don't send Bcc header with Mailhost.secureSend. Renamed CC header to Cc.
          [vincentfretin]
        
        - Fixed folder_listing.pt so it doesn't stringify and then reparse the start
          and end dates of events (this also fixes a timezone issue,
          http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10445)
          [davisagli]
        
        - Fixed folder_listing.pt so that it shows event dates in a cleaner way
          (no more redundant listing of times + dates when and event is on one day
          has same start + end time)
          [jonstahl]
        
        - Change the title of the Users folder to be more in line with its actual
          function.
          Fixes: http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9693
          [cwainwright]
        
        - Inject contentFilter as `**kw` params to topic's queryCatalog and not as first
          argument which should be the REQUEST, if given. With that in place, batching
          on contentFiltered topics works again.

          [davisagli]
        
        - Added overlays for Rename and selecting default folder views.
          [limi]
        
        - Made the core content types use CSS sprites instead of individual images,
          which cuts down the number of image HTTP requests from 11 to 2.

        - Fix several issues in the RSS template: don't get the logo name from

          only specify the publishing date in the output.
          [davisagli]
        
        - Add and adapt tests for moving dates bug which was caused by date
          conversion without respect to Daylight Saving Times.

        - Added in support WebKit- and Gecko-based small-screen devices
          (iPhone, Android, Firefox Mobile)
          [limi]
        
        - Make prefs_main_template fill portlets_one_slot instead of column_one_slot
          to add its portlet, for compatibility with Sunburst.  Also make it
          unnecessary for custom configlet templates to set display_border.
          [davisagli]
        
        - Adjusted viewlet configuration so that the Sunburst theme uses the viewlets
          defined in plone.app.layout, and the Classic theme overrides that
          configuration to achieve the old viewlet positions.
          [davisagli]
        
        - batch_macros.pt: Use request/ACTUAL_URL instead of context/absolute_url as
          batching base url so that batching works for diffent views and FSPageTemplates
          appended to context/absolute_url.
          The approach ${context/absolute_url}/${template/getId} didn't work for views.

        - Simplify folder_tabular_view to use the folder_listing macros.
          [elro]

          This was introduced to fix #7937 but it no longer seems to be a problem.
          [elro]
        
        - Simplified the "Event when" i18n introduced in 4.0b1.

        - Fixed DYNAMIC_CONTENT in heading_prefs_user_details message.
          [vincentfretin]
        
        - Updated the table_sorter.js to use Unicode for its arrows instead of images.

        - Stop removing the $ alias for jQuery, since many plugins rely on it. Users

        - Fixed livesearch_reply.py to give the context to ts.translate method.

        - Internationalized the backup-warning message in plone-upgrade.pt.
          [vincentfretin]
        
        - Removed template_id from batch_base_url in batch_macros.pt because it breaks
          when overloading the folder_listing template via zcml.
          [thet]

        4.0a5 - 2010-02-19
        ------------------
        
        - Replace `getObjPositionInParent` with stub index capable of sorting search
          results according to their position in the container, a.k.a. "nogopip".
          [witsch]
        
        - Move `isExpiry` into `CMFPlone.utils` so it can be called directly,
          i.e. without searching the skin.
          [witsch]

        - Removed deprecated 'sub' slot from discussionitem_view.pt.
          [spliter]
        
        - Added a condition to the automatic loading of ZCML configuration (via the
          ``[z3c.autoinclude.plugin]`` ``target = plone`` entry point), so that it
          is possible to disable automatic loading. This is particularly useful in
          tests, where automatically included packages can cause leakage of state or
          unrelated errors if Plone's ZCML is loaded. To disable auto-inclusion,
          you can add a ZCML statement like the following::
        
            <configure xmlns="http://namespaces.zope.org/zope"
                       xmlns:meta="http://namespaces.zope.org/meta">
                <meta:provides feature="no-autoinclude" />
            </configure>
        
          You need to do this "early", i.e. before Plone's ZCML is loaded.
          [optilude]
        
        - Fix a test regression in discussion_reply_form if the layout for the
          item being discussed has no content-core macro.  (Such as the
          link_redirect_view.py script for a Link item).
          [davisagli]
        
        - Wrapped .contentViews and .contentActions with <div id="edit-bar"> in views.

        - Add a `meta:provides` directive to `meta.zcml` that provides the feature

          [hannosch]
        
        - Depend on ``plone.app.upgrade`` so it gets installed by default. Keeping
          the upgrade package separate only made sense when it had massively more
          dependencies than Plone itself. That cleanup isn't part of Plone 4.0.
          [hannosch]

        - Adjust the _createObjectByType functions in utils and FactoryTool to use the

          logic.
          [davisagli]
        
        - By default hide the "Subfolders" tab on collections. They don't behave in a
          way understandable to users. Existing sites aren't changed.

        - Converted ``plone_javascript_variables.js`` to a browser page. Dynamically

          special ``escape_for_js`` handling of the translate script.

        - "Relevance" was not internationalized in search_form.pt. This closes
          http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9747
          [vincentfretin]
        
        - "Your Plone site is up to date" was not internationalized in plone-upgrade.pt.
          This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9746
          [vincentfretin]
        
        - "Preferences" link should go directly to the personal prefs, the memberprefs
          panel is an unnecessary abstraction here. Add-on products can easily add new
          links to the personal menu now, so that's the pattern we want to encourage.
        
        - Removed the login portlet from the default setup now that the login link opens
          an inline window.
          [limi]
        
        - Fixed a DYNAMIC_CONTENT in site_feedback_template.pt
          [vincentfretin]
        
        - Make sure the 'Portlets: View dashboard' permission is set for Members.
          [davisagli]
        
        - Make sure the mock MailHost used in tests is registered as a local utility
          so that it can be found via getToolByName.
          [davisagli]
        
        - Moved all CSS styles to plonetheme.classic package. plonetheme.sunburst is
          now default theme, both are installed by default, classic theme may be
          uninstalled, sunburst theme can't be uninstalled.
          [limi, naro]
        
        - Added site_encoding and bodyClass methods to the @@plone view. These should
          simplify main template a bit.
          [naro]
        
        - Avoid AttributeError while getting the CMF version for the
          plone_control_panel when enable-product-installation is off in
          zope.conf.
          [maurits]
        
        - Fixed bad internationalized messages in logged_out.pt
          [vincentfretin]
        
        - Changed default message for label_show_all msgid from "Show all..." to
          "Show all items" in livesearch_reply.py to be the same as in folder_contents
          view which use the same msgid.
          [vincentfretin]
        
        - Use the new ``pas_member`` view in the overview templates. This avoids
          getting the member info for each item in the listing from the PAS internals.
          [hannosch]
        
        - registerNotify and mailPassword now send properly encoded emails.
          Fixes http://dev.plone.org/old/plone/ticket/9659
          [alecm]
        
        - Deprecated register.py and join_form.cpt. This functionality has been moved
          to plone.app.users.
          [esteele]
        
        - Changed ``listActions`` on the workflow tool to no longer call the
          ``listGlobalActions`` method on every installed workflow. This method would
          internally call and calculate the worklist (reviewer_queue) for every
          workflow. The listActions method is called by the workflow menu to show the
          state drop down menu on almost all pages.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Deprecated the ``selectedTabs`` script in favor of a method on the
          GlobalSectionsViewlet.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Micro-optimize the CatalogNavigationTabs view.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Added a more prominent upgrade warning to the top of the ZMI screen, instead
          of the old tiny note on the portal migration tool.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Added a new ``@@plone-upgrade`` view, which replaces the old migration tool
          DTML ZMI screens.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Added a simple ``advanced`` mode to the add site form. If advanced is passed
          as a query argument to the ``@@plone-addsite`` more options are available.
          The button in the ZMI uses the advanced mode by default. Currently the choice
          of omitting the default content and deselecting any of the default extension
          profiles are limited to the advanced mode.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Expose the site language in the add site form and refactor the language
          guessing based on the browser language into that view. The addPloneSite
          function takes an explicit argument for the language now.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Hardcode utf-8 for UnicodeSplitter, since Hanno says that's all we
          can accept and there's no way to use getSiteEncoding from the splitter.
          [alecm]
        
        - Added option to skip the creation of the default example content in the new
          add site form. Grouped the add-ons selection via a fieldset.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Refactored the old factory dispatcher / addPloneSiteForm to use a modern
          browser page instead.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Removed the special default page and translation handling. LinguaPlone uses
          a content language negotiator per default instead.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Replaced highlightsearchterms.js with the Plone trunk
          jquery.highlightsearchterms.js plugin. This removes the need to add
          searchterm= query parameters to search.pt results.
          Refs. http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8770
          [mj]
        
        - Add a link to log out from the logged_out template if logged in as a Zope
          user via basic HTTP Authentication and the standard logout failed.
          [davisagli]
        
        - Removed the cut/copy/paste icons from the action menu in new sites, as they
          just add noise + more HTTP requests.
          [limi]
        
        - Moved happytalk in site_feedback_template.pt and author_feedback_template.pt
          to bottom of emails, per http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7001
          [jonstahl]
        
        - Added precedence: bulk header to several PasswordReset's
          mail_password_template, per http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7000 - still
          haven't added this header to CMFPlone templates.
          [jonstahl]
        
        - Added the upgrade warning to the main control panel screen. This is the same
          as found on the new overview page.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Changed the new default overview page to be a normal browser page and made
          it aware of multiple Plone sites in the root or in ZODB mountpoints.
          [hannosch, davisagli]
        
        - Overwrote the Zope quick start page, with a more helpful Plone specific
          version as already found in the unified installer.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Turned the new add Plone site button in the ZMI into a link. This allows us
          to get out of the frameset to the top.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Add jQueryTools integration, using plone.app.jquerytools.
          [smcmahon]
        
        - Updated our add site ZMI screen.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Changed search.pt (plone_forms) and rss_template.pt (plone_templates) so they
          display fullname instead of creator.
          [ralphjacobs]
        
        - Cleaned up old an unused scripts to edit the plone site object itself. This
          is done via the site control panel now.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Hide the TinyMCE profiles hidden from the Plone site add form.
          [robgietema]
        
        - Added 'Use site default' to the wysiwyg_editor field in the Personal
          Preferences view.
          [robgietema]
        
        - Set default value of wysiwyg_editor to blank (use site default).
          [robgietema]
        
        - Added default editor property to the site properties.
          [robgietema]
        
        - Added TinyMCE and set TinyMCE as default visual editor.
          [robgietema]
        
        - Removed getProductInfo method from the migration tool. It wasn't used
          anymore and depended on the persistent product registry.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Inlined the enableSyndication function into importFinalSteps in
          setuphandlers. Avoid an unneeded catalog search.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Simplified portal creation code and got rid of the PloneGenerator class in
          setuphandlers. It was a useless closure for independent functions.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Removed the `plone-site` import step and stop overriding the
          `componentregistry` step. The portal object directly implements the
          IObjectManagerSite interface, so we don't need to activate it as a site
          manager in an extra step anymore.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Updated and added various ZMI-visible tool titles.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Removed the `plone-archetypes` import step. This is handled via a normal
          GenericSetup dependency in metadata.xml.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Merged the `plone_various` import step into the `plone-final` step and
          install more packages directly by their profiles.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Removed the zserverPatch. There's not many people running ZServer as the
          front-end web server anymore, so this isn't particular useful.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Fixed the default portlet blacklisting for the `Members` folder.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Replaced Products.ATReferenceBrowserWidget with
          archetypes.referencebrowserwidget. This is PLIP 9258
          http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9258
          [tom_gross]
        
        - Clarified help text for extension profiles on the add site form.
          [davisagli]
        
        - Added a mechanism for specifying profiles that are selected by default on
          the add site form. This should be kept in sync with PloneTestCase's list
          of default extension profiles.
          [davisagli]
        
        - Hide the plonetheme.sunburst uninstall profile from the add site form.
          [davisagli]
        
        - Default to plonetheme.sunburst for new sites.
          [esteele, davisagli]
        
        - Allow email addresses as login name, with a switch on the security
          panel. This is plip 9214: Refs http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9214.
          [maurits]
        
        - Extend the language specific default configuration to set a reasonable first
          day of week on the calendar tool.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Stop pretending to use GenericSetup's content import. As a last item we now
          create the translated front-page purely in imperative code. As a bonus we
          moved the body text of the front-page to a page template, so i18ndude can
          automatically extract it.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Create and configure `Members` folder purely in setupPortalContent.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Converted import and export steps XML files to use ZCML registrations.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Made sure to have a complete list of non-installable profiles. No longer
          apply the filter to base profiles and ignore our default profile. This works
          in combination with the corresponding changes in quick installer to reduce
          portal creation time.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Make use of the new `authenticated` flag for ResourceRegistries entries
          instead of specifying verbose condition expressions.
          [hannosch]
        
        - "Categories" are now "Tags", in line with common usage and terminology.
          [limi]
        
        - Changed workflow actor variable from user/getUserName to user/getId.
          http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7398.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Removed the AT graphviz references action from all content types.
          [davisagli]
        
        - Finished switching tool and action icons to use PNG format.
          [davisagli]
        
        - Exclude some of the CMFDefault functionality, that isn't used or usable
          inside Plone sites. The CMFDefault types are no longer supported.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Move prefs_users_overview and prefs_groups_overview pages to
          plone.app.controlpanel (@@usergroup-userprefs and @@usergroup-groupprefs
          respectively).
          [esteele]
        
        - Adjust to CMF's splitting of CMFCatalogAware into separate CatalogAware,
          WorkflowAware, and OpaqueItemManager mixins.
          [davisagli]
        
        - Added zope.app.locales dependency, some strings are in zope domain such as
          'Invalid value' and '(no value)' found in portlet EditForm.
          [vincentfretin]
        
        - Moved membershipRolemapping.dtml and portrait_fix.dtml to PlonePAS.
          [davisagli]
        
        - Added icon_expr property to the Plone control panel tool actions, and
          switched to registering configlet icons here instead of in the action
          icons tool.
          [davisagli]
        
        - Moved the diff tool registration to this package, so it can still be a tool
          for Plone 4.
          [davisagli]
        
        - Use the new zope.ramcache in favor of zope.app.cache.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Removed GroupUserFolder skin layers.
          [davisagli]
        
        - Silenced the deprecation warning about old-style actions from CMFCore's
          ActionProviderBase when listing configlets with the control panel tool.
          [davisagli]
        
        - Added the _IMREALLYPLONE4 hint to factory.py for PloneTestCase to use.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Removed the calendar and review portlets from the standard global
          assignments. The review list is better put onto a personal dashboard and the
          calendar is exceptionally slow and rather user unfriendly. The news and
          events portlets are a better fit to show-case the portlets system.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Include the `overrides.zcml` from `Products.PlacelessTranslationService` to
          actually make PTS' language negotiator available to the zope.i18n machinery.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Got rid of the ToolNames indirection and declared the meta_types directly
          in the relevant tool class themselves.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Moved ATCT specific exportimport code into the ATCT package itself.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Made sure the plone.indexer registration works by introducing a more
          specific IPloneCatalogTool marker interface and registering the indexable
          object wrapper for this.
          [optilude]
        
        - Added a restricted version of the opaqueItems method for CMFCatalogAware.
          This takes the idea of experimental.opaquespeedup one step further.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Actually made the types tool action lookup optimization effective. Slightly
          optimized the add items drop-down menu.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Removed the `ResourceRegistries` skin layer. It only contained test code.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Make use of the new IContainer API of object managers and replace objectIds
          and objectValues calls.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Finally removed the interfacePatch for the IContainer interface of
          OFS.ObjectManager after it has been merged upstream.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Removed CMFTopic from our dependency list, it turns out that we aren't
          actually using any of it.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Added proper deprecation warnings for the IBrowserDefault,
          IDynamicViewTypeInformation and ISelectableBrowserDefault interfaces, who
          has always come from Products.CMFDynamicViewFTI.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Use the `replace_local_role_manager` method from borg.localrole.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Deprecate our own IOrderedContainer interface in favor of the original one
          from OFS.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Avoid dependency on the zope.app.zapi package.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Declare package dependencies and fixed deprecation warnings for use
          of Globals.
          [hannosch]
        
        - No longer depend on the PageTemplates.GlobalTranslationService but use
          zope.i18n directly.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Merged in more performance optimizations from experimental.contentcreation.
          We don't restrict the permissions for the temporary folder anymore, but
          only care about the permissions of the actual target folder.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Use the new `icon_expr` for specifying icons for content types instead.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Prefer path expressions over Python expressions for persistent expressions.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Fixed the content_status_history form to include the required content table.
          The old_folder_contents template is gone.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Fixed the browserDefault tests to use actual traversal to look up views
          for content items instead of relying on Acquisition.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Moved the `scale_image` function from utils into the PlonePAS.utils
          module, as PlonePAS is the only user of it.
          [hannosch]
        
        - The remaining functionality from GroupUserFolder has been merged into
          the PlonePAS package. GroupUserFolder is no longer required.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Removed the groups, groupdata, membership and memberdata tools from this
          package. All code is now in a central place inside PlonePAS. The persistent
          tools have been from the PlonePAS package since Plone 2.5.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Replaced has_key method calls with containment checks via `in`.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Replaced a direct interface invocation with a queryAdapter call, to avoid
          an internal getattr call and make the pattern clearer.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Replaced here with context in all templates and scripts. The old spelling is
          still supported, but we need to settle on one to avoid confusion.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Optimized the types tool action lookup further to avoid Acquisition lookups.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Simplified the normalizeString method.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Optimized the action lookup code and implemented category restriction for
          the types tool in the same way it was available for the actions tool.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Removed remaining sys.modules hacks to provide the browser.ploneview as
          browser.plone.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Removed last unused external methods and PloneInitialize code. To my
          knowledge the Windows installer doesn't use this code anymore.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Write the doctype definition in the main_template in a way that does not
          claim to be valid XML, as the main_template really isn't.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Worked around `sys._getframe` call in mark_view.
          [malthe, hannosch]
        
        - Removed macro slot for changing the document type; this was not
          correct XML and should this flexibility be required, it's
          recommended to customize `main_template.pt`.
          [malthe]
        
        - Turned deprecated string 'Unauthorized' exceptions into real exceptions.
          [davisagli]
        
        - Removed module alias for the ploneview formerly named plone.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Clarified content language versus response language handling.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Removed unmaintained and unused Favorite content type.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Removed our own home-grown dependency checking code.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Exposed option to honour exclude from navigation even in subfolders from
          navtree_preferences.  Request from theming sprinter at ploneconf2008.
          [MatthewWilkes]
        
        - Made the fieldset tabbing code faster on startup (especially for IE) by
          constructing a big string and creating the HTML elements in one bunch
          instead of using DOM functions to add them step by step.
          [fschulze]
        
        - Added uniqueItemIndex as a method to the plone view.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Added back ``global_defines.pt`` as a template including the (empty)
          macro definition. This allows main templates to be compatible with both
          Plone 3.x and 4.0 at the same time.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Removed ``global_defines.pt`` and the globalize-hack. Templates
          now bring in their tool and function dependency using the
          standard utility views or via normal Acquisition of tools.
          [malthe, hannosch]
        
        - Fixed test for editing language fields. This refs
          http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8342.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Removed deprecated context parameter in getDefaultPage and
          isDefaultPage in utils.py.
          [maurits]
        
        - Made sure the export order of the factory tool GS step is consistent.
          This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7892.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Replaced lock_icon with smaller version with one third of the size.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Removed backwards-compatibility code in calendar_formfields.js introduced
          in Plone 3.1.4. Any date-time picker not based on calendar_macros.pt
          using the old-style (no plone.jscalendar namespace) methods will no
          longer work until adjusted.
          [mj]
        
        - Don't show relevance information of one percent in the search form,
          since sort_on searches will always show this for all entries
          This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/4325
          [hannosch]
        
        - Removed duplicated isMemberIdAllowed method from registration tool.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Fixed mailto link in event view and enhanced the spam protect script to
          allow setting css ids on the generated anchor tag. This closes
          http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8219
          [hannosch]
        
        - Fixed contact form to be usable for authenticated users which have no
          email address stored in their member data. This closes
          http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/5766
          [hannosch]
        
        - Avoid empty tags in the contact form. This closes
          http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8182
          [hannosch]
        
        - Avoid an empty div in login_form. This closes
          http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8192
          [hannosch]
        
        - Avoid an empty dd in recently modified.pt. This closes
          http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8186
          [hannosch]
        
        - Avoid an empty span in folder_summary_view. This closes
          http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8181
          [hannosch]
        
        - Changed wording in personalize form to remove reference to external
          editor icon and add a note about ZopeEditManager. This closes
          http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7390
          [hannosch]
        
        - Changed webstats_js in portal properties to a text field.
          This refs http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7781
          [hannosch]
        
        - Added option to the error log control panel to search for an error log
          entry by number, since the number is the only thing that is exposed to
          normal users. This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7234
          [hannosch]
        
        - Changed title of collections control panel to plural form. This
          closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8096
          [hannosch]
        
        - Include link to the plone.org upgrade manual from the migration tool
          inside the ZMI. This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8075
          [hannosch]
        
        - Clarify help text in content_status_history. This closes
          http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8218
          [hannosch]
        
        - Let default RSS list publication date, not modified date and include
          the body text. This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7952
          [hannosch]
        
        - Updated the check_id script to disallowed content by the name of
          properties. This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6005
          [hannosch]
        
        - Fixed invalid markup in membershipRolemapping.dtml. This closes
          http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6222
          [hannosch]
        
        - Removed long unused getObjPositionInParent.py script which wasn't
          functional at all anymore, since it used Zope 2 interfaces. Also
          simplified the getObjPositionInParent function in the CatalogTool.
          This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6081
          [hannosch]
        
        - Removed getActionObject call from createObject script. It was a private
          method and would always fail. This closes
          http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7172
          [hannosch]
        
        - Removed testing of sendto action visibilty from sendto.cpy. There's a
          permission to use to restrict sending mail. This closes
          http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/5377
          [hannosch]
        
        - Disable external editor icon for structural folders. This closes
          http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6871
          [hannosch]
        
        - Updated the check_id script to disallowed content by the name of zip or
          plone since this shadows the views by those names. This closes
          http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6105
          [hannosch]
        
        - Purged old Zope 2 Interface interfaces for Zope 2.12 compatibility.
          [elro]
        
        - Make use of upgrade steps with a source '*' version and an explicit
          destination, to register the 'enable site' and 'register tools as
          utilities' only once.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Added support for upgrade step groups to the migration tool and started
          exposing the individual upgrade methods as steps.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Changed the way messages are handled during migration. We don't pass an
          `out` list around anymore, but use the logging framework.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Replaced our own migration step registration by using GenericSetup steps
          directly. Changed the migration tool to integrate with GS instead.
          Added BBB code to read the instance version from the migration tool if
          the last profile version isn't set yet inside the GS tool.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Exposed all our migration steps as GenericSetup upgrade steps.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Hide the deprecation warning about the moved ITranslatable interface
          for our own code.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Use png icons instead of gif icons since they are much more flexible
          for styling.
          [dannyb, wichert]
        
        - Fixed the coreVersions method in MigrationTool to return strings and not
          bound methods for the Zope and Python version.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Fixed off-by-two error in transaction_note. This closes
          http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7610
          [hannosch]
        
        - Moved all icons for real actions from the action icons tool to the
          actions themselves.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Changed PloneTool's getIconFor method to prefer the icon expression set
          on the action itself instead of looking it up in the action icons tool.
          This finally makes use of the new icon expression on actions introduced
          in CMF 2.1.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Avoid unneeded line breaks in TAL output, by effectively disabling the
          internal beautified wrapping inside tags. This reduces the HTML output
          by 5% - 10% for normal Plone pages.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Memoize the installed products and packages in App.FactoryDispatcher
          for the duration of the process runtime.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Hiding page history, page navigation, and busy icon (spinner) in print.css
          Related to http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7433
          http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7402
          [siebo]
        
        - Updated webdav_enabled method in utils.py to check for
          webdav.interfaces.IWriteLock interface in addition to the old Zope2
          interface.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Use a FauxArchetypeTool which returns no catalogs for CatalogMultiplex
          aware objects in portal factory. This prevents most temporary objects
          from being indexed in the first place.
          [tesdal, hannosch]
        
        - Move our GenericSetup import step registrations to zcml.
          [wichert]
        
        - Added a 'do-not-use' warning to the ZMI security screen for Plone content
          objects. Sharing tab or workflows are what you are looking for.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Moved interface declarations for factorytool from ZCML to the class.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Added BBB code for ITranslatable, which is now part of LinguaPlone.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Added an explicit button to add a new Plone site to the ZMI for faster
          access. If you have installed Plone this is probably what you want to
          add most of the time. The button only shows up in the root folder.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Deprecate the ITranslatable interface. This interface is LinguaPlone-
          specific and has thus been moved to LinguaPlone.
          [wichert]
        
        - Removed tests for isRTL method of PTS. The method was deprecated in the
          last release and is gone now.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Removed PTSTranslationDomain utilities. PTS exposes all translation files
          as pure Zope3 translation utilities now, so these aren't needed anymore.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Replaced our FasterStringIO implementation by one based on
          collections.deque, which is a faster than StringIO.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Removed more deprecated code, adjusted some comments.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Tweaked sortable_title method to give reasonable results for titles with
          many numbers in them, like '1.2.3 document'.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Moved CMF skins registration into configure.zcml, removed security
          declaration for no-longer extant listPolicies of the portal.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Refactored initial content creation into a separate extension profile,
          thus making it possible to skip it. This refs
          http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6948
          [hannosch]
        
        - Removed some outdated Extension scripts.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Removed deprecated tool related Zope2 interfaces. Extended the
          deprecation period for ConstrainTypes and NonStructuralFolder as these
          are still used in Plone Core.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Removed work-around code for insertion of non-unicode non-ascii non-utf8
          encoded text in TAL. This will produce an error now. Always use Unicode
          when using data in page templates and TAL.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Removed lots of deprecated code and zcml registrations.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Fixed ticket #9420 DC.date.valid_range not emitted if only Publishing Date is set.
