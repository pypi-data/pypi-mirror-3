        ===============
        
        The `grokcore.layout` package provides a simple way to write view
        components which can be included into a defined layout. It turns
        around two main components : the Page and the Layout.
        
        Layout
        ======
        
        The layout is a component allowing you to design your site. Often,
        it's the common structure shared between all the pages. Technically,
        it is a class based on the view components interface, providing a
        'render' and 'update' method.
        
        Let's implement a simple Layout:
        
          >>> from grokcore.layout import Layout
          >>> from zope.interface import Interface
          >>> import grokcore.component as grok
        
          >>> class MyLayout(Layout):
          ...     grok.name('mylayout')
          ...     grok.context(Interface)
          ...
          ...     def render(self):
          ...         return u"a simple layout"
        
        We grok our component:
        
          >>> grok_component('MyLayout', MyLayout)
          True
        
        We check it has been correctly registered:
        
          >>> from grokcore.layout import ILayout
          >>> from zope.component import getMultiAdapter
          >>> from zope.publisher.browser import TestRequest
        
          >>> layout = getMultiAdapter((TestRequest(), Interface), ILayout)
          >>> isinstance(layout, MyLayout)
          True
          >>> layout.render()
          u'a simple layout'
        
        Now let's see how to use this Layout in a specific context using a Page.
        
        Page
        ====
        
        The page is the specific code that you want to control. It is based on
        the grokcore.View browser page implementation and therefore provides a
        ``render`` and ``update`` method. The ``render`` method will simply
        return the specific HTML code generated by the template or the
        ``render`` method code while ``__call__`` will lookup for a Layout
        component and renders itself inside it.
        
        First, we'll create 2 models that will serve as exemples.
        
          >>> class Aurochs(grok.Context):
          ...    description = u'Looks like a bull'
        
          >>> class Mammoth(grok.Context):
          ...    description = u'Looks like an elephant'
        
        Let's create now a page that will display their description.
        
          >>> from grokcore.layout import Page
          >>> class AnimalDisplay(Page):
          ...    grok.name('display')
          ... 	 grok.context(Interface)
          ...
          ...    def render(self):
          ...        return self.context.description
        
        Grokking our Page will let us use it.
        
          >>> grok_component('AnimalDisplay', AnimalDisplay)
          True
          >>> wooly = Mammoth()
          >>> page = getMultiAdapter((wooly, TestRequest()), name='display')
          >>> page.content()
          u'Looks like an elephant'
          >>> page()
          u'a simple layout'
        
        As we can see, the page is using the layout, on the __call__ to
        render. Of course, this example Layout doesn't provide any interesting
        feature. Let's create something more interesting, by using our page
        with the help of the 'content' method:
        
          >>> class MammothLayout(Layout):
          ...     grok.context(Mammoth)
          ...
          ...	  def render(self):
          ...	      return u'Header. Page: %s. Footer' % self.view.content()
        
          >>> grok_component('MammothLayout', MammothLayout)
          True
          >>> page()
          u'Header. Page: Looks like an elephant. Footer'
        
        Forms & Errorpages
        ==================
        
        Baseclasses for Form views (FormPage, AddFormPage, EditFormPage and DisplayFormPage) and Error
        views (NotFoundPage, ExceptionPage, UnauthorizedPage) are available which are
        all aware of Layout components like Page is.
        
        
        Changelog
        =========
        
        1.6 (2012-05-10)
        ----------------
        
        - Moved the lookup for a specific layout to a helper method, so other
          layout aware components can use the same lookup.
        
        1.5.1 (2012-05-02)
        ------------------
        
        - Do not require the [role] extra of grokcore.security anymore.
        
        1.5 (2012-05-02)
        ----------------
        
        - Move the layout-aware form components to the grok package where the
          dependency with grokcore.formib can be mixed in.
        
        - Add a directive ``layout`` to select a different type of layout. A layout
          type is defined on a ``Layout`` component with the help of the
          ``grokcore.component.provides`` directive. It defaults to ``ILayout``
          for compatibility.
        
        - Change how the static resources are associated to a ``Layout``,
          using the new name ``__static_name__`` set by the template grokker.
        
        1.4 (2011-07-13)
        ----------------
        
        - Rename megrok.layout to grokcore.layout. ``application_url`` and ``flash``
          utilities have been removed, \*Form components have been renamed to
          \*FormPage.
        
        - Added ExceptionPage, NotFoundPage and UnauthorizedPage layout-aware
          components.
        
        - Fixed default template for grokcore.layout.Form component.
        
        1.3 (2011-01-12)
        ----------------
        
        - Compatibility with grokcore.view 2.3.
        
        1.2.0 (2010-12-16)
        ------------------
        
        - Update to use the new TemplateGrokker from grokcore.view.
        
        1.1.0 (2010-03-03)
        ------------------
        
        - ``z3c.flashmessage`` has been dropped in favor of
          ``grokcore.message``. This new package takes in charge the
          registration of the utilities and retains the existing API. The
          back-compatibility is assured.
        
        1.0.2 (2010-02-26)
        ------------------
        
        - The existence test for the `application_url` site-lookup was
          wrongly using a "if not" statement. In a case of a container, the object
          is evaluated to False if it's empty. We now use a proper "if .. is
          None". [trollfot]
        
        1.0.1 (2010-02-25)
        ------------------
        
        - Forms now inherit from `UtilityView` and therefore get the
          `application_url` and `flash` methods. Tests have been added to
          garanty the behavior. [trollfot]
        
        1.0 (2010-02-25)
        ----------------
        
        - The dependencies have been heavily cleaned up. All zope.app packages
          have been removed. We are now running with minimal dependencies and
          using the latest ZTK. This release will probably *not* run on
          `Grok 1.0`. You will need `Grok 1.1rc1` to be able to use
          it. [trollfot]
        
        - Added a component called UtilityView that provides two useful
          methods : application_url, flash. These methods are almost a copy of
          what can be found in the `Grok` package. The application_url is
          using a simple getSite hook to get the root of the application. This
          might be irrelevant for some applications and can be overriden.
          [trollfot]
        
        - Added a module called 'messages' that contains the flash messages
          utilities. This module is *NOT* grokked and must be grokked
          manually. This prevents conflicts with grokui.admin's own
          definitions of the very same components. It also allows you to
          override the `flash` method to use something else than
          z3c.flashmessage and then not be bothered by useless utilities. The
          flash messages utilities can be registered by including the
          ``messages.zcml`` file in your own project or package ZCML file.
          [trollfot]
        
        0.9 (2009-09-26)
        ----------------
        
        - Add default templates to form which doesn't contain an html and body
          tag.
          [sylvain]
        
        - Add an AddForm, EditForm and DisplayForm, all aware of the layout
          component.
          [sylvain]
        
        0.8 (2009-09-17)
        ----------------
        
        - Remove the CodePage, since CodeView have been removed from
          grokcore.view.
          [sylvain]
        
        0.7 (2009-09-15)
        ----------------
        
        - Add a CodePage to be compatible with the last version of
          grokcore.view (higher than 1.9). This breaks compatibility with
          previous release. You need to change any Page using a render method
          to a CodePage.
          [sylvain]
        
        - The content property on a Page is no longer a property, but a method
          as it's hidding exceptions. You might need to update your code to
          reflect that change as well.
          [sylvain]
        
        - Fix MANIFEST.in.
          [sylvain]
        
        0.6 (2009-09-14)
        ----------------
        
        - switch the arguments order in calling the layout
          [cklinger, sylvain]
        
        - add the CHANGES.txt
          [cklinger]
        
        0.5 (2009-07-24)
        ----------------
        
        - remove the grok dependency
          [cklinger trollfot]
