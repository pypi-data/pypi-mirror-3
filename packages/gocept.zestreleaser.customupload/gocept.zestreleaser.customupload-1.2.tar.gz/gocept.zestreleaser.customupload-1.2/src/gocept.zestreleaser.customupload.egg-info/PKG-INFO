Description: =================
        Custom egg upload
        =================
        
        This package provides a plugin for ``zest.releaser`` that offers to upload the
        released egg via SCP or HTTP PUT (WebDAV) to a custom location (instead of or
        in addition to PyPI).
        
        To use, add a section to your ``~/.pypirc`` like the following::
        
            [gocept.zestreleaser.customupload]
            gocept = scp://download.gocept.com:/var/www/packages
            gocept.special = http://dav.gocept.com/special
        
        If the name of the package being released starts with one of the keys in that
        section (longest match wins, case insensitive), you will be prompted whether to
        upload the egg (that was created by zest.releaser by checking out the tag) to
        the given server.
        
        
        Uploading Documentation
        =======================
        
        In addition to uploading the egg, the plugin also offers to upload generated
        documentation.
        
        To use this functionality, create a ``~/.zestreleaserrc`` that contains
        something like the following::
        
            [gocept.zestreleaser.customupload.doc]
            gocept = docs.gocept.com:/var/www/doc
        
        If the name of the package being released starts with one of the keys in that
        section, the plugin will run ``./bin/doc`` to generate the documentation and
        then prompt to upload the contents of ``./build/doc``. The upload destination
        is assembled from the configured prefix, the package name and version. In the
        example, the upload location would be ``/var/www/doc/gocept.foo/1.3``.
