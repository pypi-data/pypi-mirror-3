        Overview
        ========
        
        This plone product allows you to import / export portal's members within CSV
        files. Few properties may equally been set.
        
        
        Description
        ===========
        
        * after being installed with the Quickinstaller tool, it adds an additional
          item in the control panel.
          
        * Informations concerned are those managed by portal_registration and portal_membership.
          (i.e. username, password, roles, emails, location, description ...)
        
        * A CSV template is directly available via the control panel, to use as a base
          for your own CSV file.
        
        * There is no pretreatment. Data are used out-of-the-box. If any error occured
          in the CSV while importing, you have to correct those yourself.
          
        * On errors, this product allows you to download a CSV file only filled with the
          matching lines. Use it to correct your errors, then retry.
