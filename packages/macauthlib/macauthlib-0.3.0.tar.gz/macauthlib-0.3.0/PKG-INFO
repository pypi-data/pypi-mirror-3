        macauthlib:  library for implementing MAC Access Authentication
        ===============================================================
        
        This is a low-level library for implementing MAC Access Authentication, a
        simple HTTP request-signing scheme described in:
        
            http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-http-mac-01
        
        To access resources using MAC Access Authentication, the client must have
        obtained a set of MAC credentials including an id and secret key.  They use
        these credentials to make signed requests to the server.
        
        When accessing a protected resource, the server will generate a 401 challenge
        response with the scheme "MAC" as follows::
        
            > GET /protected_resource HTTP/1.1
            > Host: example.com
        
            < HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
            < WWW-Authenticate: MAC
        
        The client will use their MAC credentials to build a request signature and
        include it in the Authorization header like so::
        
            > GET /protected_resource HTTP/1.1
            > Host: example.com
            > Authorization: MAC id="h480djs93hd8",
            >                    ts="1336363200",
            >                    nonce="dj83hs9s",
            >                    mac="bhCQXTVyfj5cmA9uKkPFx1zeOXM="
        
            < HTTP/1.1 200 OK
            < Content-Type: text/plain
            <
            < For your eyes only:  secret data!
        
        
        This library provices the low-level functions necessary to implement such
        an authentication scheme.  For MAC Auth clients, it provides the following
        function:
        
            * sign_request(req, id, key, hashmod=sha1):  sign a request using
                                                         MAC Access Auth.
        
        For MAC Auth servers, it provides the following functions:
        
            * get_id(req):  get the claimed MAC Auth id
                            from the request.
        
            * check_signature(req, key, hashmod=sha1):  check that the request was
                                                        signed with the given key.
        
        
        
        0.3.0 - 2012-07-11
        ==================
        
         * Simplify API of the NonceCache class; it now provides a single method
           check_nonce() rather than separate is_fresh() and add_nonce() methods.
        
        
        0.2.0 - 2012-06-01
        ==================
        
         * Fix a race condition bug in NonceCache.
        
        
        0.1.0 - 2012-02-27
        ==================
        
         * Initial release.
