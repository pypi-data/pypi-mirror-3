Description: 
        Starting as a bored-one-night hack home feed scraper, YATI is now (turning
        into?) a full-blown twitter CLI, with the ability to retrieve any number of
        tweets from your home timeline, post status updates, and retweet statuses. You
        can do cool things with YATI, like hooking it up to a crontab and embedding a
        subshell on your desktop to get the latest tweets right there, or integrate it
        into your Jenkins servers for up-to-the-minute broadcasts on your build
        statuses.
        
        More features, such as being able to retrieve tweets from specific friends, get
        mentions, etc. will be added in the future!
