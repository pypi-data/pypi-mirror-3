Description: Project Description
        ===================
        
        Taghelper uses Zemanta, OpenAmplify, Evri, OpenCalais, Yahoo, SiLLC
        and tagthe.net
        
        
        Installation with buildout
        ==========================
        
        Add collective.taghelper to the eggs section of you buildout: ::
        
            eggs =
                collective.taghelper
        
        
        Activate the product in your add ons section. This will install a Tag Helper
        controlpanel in you site setup. You have to fill in the API Keys for the
        webservices you want to use and choose if you want to use the local content
        or the destination of a link if your content type has an attribute remote_url
        (In Plone OOTB this would be the link type). The product adds
        a new tab for your content named tagging. In this form you can choose the
        keywords you want to add to your content. Keywords assigned earlier
        manually will be preserved.
