Description: Voltron Fork of MongoAlchemy
        ============================
        
        This is a fork of the awesome MongoAlchemy project, containing a number of new
        features which are very poorly, if at all documented. Hopefully that will be
        fixed in the near future.
        
        A big thanks goes out to Jeff Jenkins (jeff@qcircles.net) as the original
        creator of MongoAlchemy. The documentation linked to below is the normal
        documentation for MongoAlchemy.

        This project is almost entirely driven by what people need.  There are still 
        quite a few things which MA can't do that the standard mongo driver can, but 
        they are largely things which I don't need to do (in particular, I basically 
        never do server-side code execution for performance reasons) and so I don't
        have as good of a grasp of what the common use-cases are or how to best make 
        them easier to deal with.  If MongoAlchemy doesn't do something you need it to,
        **please file a bug/feature request**.  I'm very responsive and **will typically 
        turn around a case within a day or two**.
