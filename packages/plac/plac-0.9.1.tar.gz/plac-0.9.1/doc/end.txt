There is more to plac. I did not talk about:

1. an utility to run commands in parallel (runp)
2. an experimental server to run plac interpreters remotely
3. a builtin support for writing GUI monitors (in fieri)
4. various details and technicalities

Everything is explained in the documentation:

http://plac.googlecode.com/hg/doc/plac.pdf

Starting from release 0.9 plac has its own
GoogleCode project:

Please, easy_install plac and enjoy!
