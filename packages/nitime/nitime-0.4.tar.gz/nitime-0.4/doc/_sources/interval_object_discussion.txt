==================
 Interval objects
==================

Intervals are very useful!


Should interval objects contain a slice object? 

slice(t_start,t_end,t_offset) ,where t_offset is an optional input

OR: It can be an original object with the default constructor as similar as
possible to the constructor of the slice object, so that we can use slice-like
operations, but still maintain slice algebra and such.
