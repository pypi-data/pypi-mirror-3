Description: Faculty Staff Directory: Core
        =============================

        Faculty Staff Directory is a personnel directory that provides a way of
        creating and grouping personnel.
        
        This package is a part of the next generation `FacultyStaffDirectory`_. It
        will only work with Plone 4.1 and greater.
        
        The ``fsd.core`` package provides three types of content: Person,
        Group and Person Group Data. The Person and Group content-types makes up the
        majority of the functionality required to build a rudimentary personnel
        directory.
        
        The Person Group Data content-type is used to provide metadata
        about the Person to Group relationship (e.g. Affiliation -> 'President',
        Title -> 'Store Manager'). This content-type is not directly addable through
        the Plone interface. Group data can only be applied through the Person or Group
        edit forms.
        
        The provided content-types of purposely lean to increase the reusability of the types. The `fsd.classic`_ package can be used to add common personnel fields (and fields commonly found in `FacultyStaffDirectory`_) to the Person content-type.
