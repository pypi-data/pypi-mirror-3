Pyofss: Python-based optical fibre system simulator
***************************************************

Pyofss allows construction of an optical fibre system from separate modules.
A typical system consists of a Gaussian pulse generator module and an optical 
fibre module.
The field generated is propagated through the fibre by numerical integration of 
an appropriate SchrÃ¶dinger-type equation.
Resulting field profiles may be plotted, including map and waterfall plots of 
the propagation.

   then run the commands.

   **Always be cautious when running with enhanced privileges!**

Pyofss is available on Pypi and may be retrieved using the pip program::

   $ aptitude install pip
   $ pip install pyofss

Then import pyofss within scripts or in an interactive session:
   >>> from pyofss import *

.. note::
   If the required dependencies are not satisfied when installing pyofss, then manually install using either::

      $ aptitude install python-numpy python-scipy python-matplotlib

   or::

      $ pip install numpy scipy matplotlib

   The recommended versions are listed in the "requirements.txt" file within the pyofss package.
   Using this file, it is possible to automatically install all dependencies::

      $ pip install -r requirements.txt
