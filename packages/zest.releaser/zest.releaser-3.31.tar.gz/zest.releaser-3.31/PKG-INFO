Description: Package releasing made easy
        ===========================
        
        
        zest.releaser is collection of command-line programs to help you
        automate the task of releasing a software project. It's particularly
        helpful with Python package projects, but it can also be used for
        non-Python projects. For example, it's used to tag buildouts - a project
        only needs a ``version.txt`` file to be used with zest.releaser.
        
        It will help you to automate:
        
        * Updating the version number. The version number can either be in
          setup.py or version.txt. For example, 0.3.dev0 (current) to 0.3
          (release) to 0.4.dev0 (new development version).
        
        * Updating the history/changes file. It logs the release date on release
          and adds a new section for the upcoming changes (new development version).
        
        * Tagging the release. It creates a tag in your version control system
          named after the released version number.
        
        * Uploading a source release to PyPI. It will only do this if the
          package is already registered there (else it will ask, defaulting to
          'no'); the Zest Releaser is careful not to publish your private
          projects! It can also check out the tag in a temporary directory in
          case you need to modify it.

        Installation
        ------------
        
        Getting a good installation consists of two steps: getting the
        zest.releaser commands, and setting up your environment so you can
        upload releases to pypi (if you want that).
        
        Get the zest.releaser commands
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Just a simple ``pip zest.releaser`` or ``easy_install zest.releaser``
        is enough.
        
        Alternatively, buildout users can install zest.releaser as part of a
        specific project's buildout, by having a buildout configuration such as::
        
            [buildout]
            parts = releaser
        
            [releaser]
            recipe = zc.recipe.egg
            eggs = zest.releaser
        
        
        Prepare for pypi distribution
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Of course you must have a version control system installed.
        zest.releaser currently supports:
        
        - Subversion (svn)
        
        - Mercurial (hg)
        
        - Git (git)
        
        - Bazaar (bzr)
        
        Others could be added if there are volunteers.
        
        When the (full)release command tries to upload your package to a pypi
        server, zest.releaser basically just executes the command ``python
        setup.py register sdist upload``.  The ``python`` here is the same
        python that was used to install zest.releaser.  If that command would
        fail when you try it manually (for example because you have not
        configured a .pypirc file yet), then zest.releaser does not magically
        make it work.  This means that you may need to have some extra python
        packages installed:
        
        - setuptools or distribute (when using subversion 1.5 or higher you
          need setuptools 0.6c11 or higher or any distribute version)
        
        - setuptools-git (Setuptools plugin for finding files under Git
          version control)
        
        - setuptools_hg (Setuptools plugin for finding files under Mercurial
          version control)
        
        - setuptools_bzr (Setuptools plugin for finding files under Bazaar
          version control)
        
        - collective.dist (when using python2.4, depending on your
          ``~/.pypirc`` file)
        
        - setuptools_subversion (Setuptools plugin for finding files under
          Subversion version control.)  You probably need this when you
          upgrade to the recent subversion 1.7.  If you suddenly start missing
          files in the sdists you upload to PyPI you definitely need it.
          Alternatively: set up a proper MANIFEST.in as that method works with
          any version control system.
        
        The setuptools plugins are mostly so you do not miss files in the
        generated sdist that is uploaded to pypi.
        
        For more info, see the section on `Uploading to pypi server(s)`_.
        
        In general, if you are missing files in the uploaded package, the best
        is to put a proper ``MANIFEST.in`` file next to your ``setup.py``.
        See `zest.pocompile`_ for an example.
        
        .. _`zest.pocompile`: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zest.pocompile
        
        
        Running
        -------
        
        Zest.releaser gives you four commands to help in releasing python
        packages.  They must be run in a version controlled checkout.  The commands
        are:
        
        - **prerelease**: asks you for a version number (defaults to the current
          version minus a 'dev' or so), updates the setup.py or version.txt and the
          HISTORY.txt/CHANGES.txt/CHANGES with this new version number and offers to
          commit those changes to subversion (or bzr or hg or git)
        
        - **release**: copies the the trunk or branch of the current checkout and
          creates a version control tag of it.  Makes a checkout of the tag in a
          temporary directory.  Offers to register and upload a source dist
          of this package to PyPI (Python Package Index).  Note: if the package has
          not been registered yet, it will not do that for you.  You must register the
          package manually (``python setup.py register``) so this remains a conscious
          decision.  The main reason is that you want to avoid having to say: "Oops, I
          uploaded our client code to the internet; and this is the initial version
          with the plaintext root passwords."
        
        - **postrelease**: asks you for a version number (gives a sane default), adds
          a development marker to it, updates the setup.py or version.txt and the
          HISTORY.txt/CHANGES.txt with this and offers to commit those changes to
          version control. Note that with git and hg, you'd also be asked to push your
          changes (since 3.27). Otherwise the release and tag only live in your local
          hg/git repository and not on the server.
        
        - **fullrelease**: all of the above in order.
        
        There are two additional tools:
        
        - **longtest**: small tool that renders a setup.py's long description
          and opens it in a web browser. This assumes an installed docutils
          (as it needs ``rst2html.py``).
        
        - **lasttagdiff**: small tool that shows the diff of the currently committed
          trunk with the last released tag.  Handy for checking whether all the
          changes are adequately described in the HISTORY.txt/CHANGES.txt.
        
        
        Details
        =======
        
        
        Current assumptions
        -------------------
        
        Zest.releaser originated at `Zest software <http://zestsoftware.nl>`_ so there
        are some assumptions build-in that might or might not fit you.  Lots of people
        are using it in various companies and open source projects, so it'll probably
        fit :-)
        
        - If you are using svn, your svn is structured with /trunk, /tags (or
          /tag) and optionally /branches (or /branch).  Both a /trunk or a
          /branches/something checkout is ok.
        
        - There's a version.txt or setup.py in your project. The version.txt
          has a single line with the version number (newline optional). The
          setup.py should have a single ``version = '0.3'`` line
          somewhere. You can also have it in the actual ``setup()`` call, on
          its own line still, as `` version = '0.3',``. Indentation and the
          comma are preserved.  If you need something special, you can always
          do a ``version=version`` and put the actual version statement in a
          zest.releaser-friendly format near the top of the file. Reading (in
          Plone products) a version.txt into setup.py works great, too.
        
        - The history file (either HISTORY.txt, CHANGES.txt or CHANGES)
          restriction is probably the most severe at the moment. zest.releaser
          searches for a restructuredtext header with parenthesis. So
          something like::
        
            Changelog for xyz
            =================
        
            0.3 (unreleased)
            ----------------
        
            - Did something
        
            0.2 (1972-12-25)
            ----------------
        
            - Reinout was born.
        
          That's just the style we started with.  Pretty clear and useful.  It also
          supports the current zopeskel style with ``0.3 - unreleased``.
        
        - If using Python 2.4 you don't want to have tar.gz eggs due to `an obscure bug
          on python <http://bugs.python.org/issue1719898>`_
        
        
        Development notes, bug tracker
        ------------------------------
        
        The source code can be found on github:
        https://github.com/zestsoftware/zest.releaser
        
        If you are going to do a fix or want to run the tests, please see the
        ``DEVELOPERS.txt`` file in the root of the package.
        
        Bugs can be added to https://bugs.launchpad.net/zest.releaser .
        
        Note that there are alternative release scripts available, for instance
        http://pypi.python.org/pypi/collective.releaser which installs itself as a
        setuptools command ("python setup.py release"), so it "only" works with
        setuptools projects.
        
        
        Uploading to pypi server(s)
        ---------------------------
        
        Like noted earlier, for safety reasons zest.releaser will only offer
        to upload your package to http://pypi.python.org when the package is
        already registered there.  If this is not the case yet, you can go to
        the directory where zest.releaser put the checkout (or make a fresh
        checkout yourself.  Then with the python version of your choice do::
        
          python setup.py register sdist upload
        
        For this to work you will need a ``.pypirc`` file in your home
        directory that has your pypi login credentials like this::
        
          [server-login]
          username:maurits
          password:secret
        
        Since python 2.6, or in earlier python versions with collective.dist,
        you can specify multiple indexes for uploading your package in
        ``.pypirc``::
        
          [distutils]
          index-servers =
            pypi
            local
        
          [pypi]
          #pypi.python.org
          username:maurits
          password:secret
        
          [local]
          repository:http://localhost:8080/test/products/
          username:maurits
          password:secret
          # You may need to specify the realm, which is the domain the
          # server sends back when you do a challenge:
          #realm:Zope
        
        See http://pypi.python.org/pypi/collective.dist for more info.
        
        When all this is configured correctly, zest.releaser will first
        reregister and upload at the official pypi (if the package is
        registered there already).  Then it will offer to upload to the other
        index servers that you have specified in ``.pypirc``.
        
        Note that since version 3.15, zest.releaser also looks for this
        information in the setup.cfg if your package has that file.  One way
        to use this, is to restrict the servers that zest.releaser will ask
        you upload to.  If you have defined 40 index-servers in your pypirc
        but you have the following in your setup.cfg, you will not be asked to
        upload to any server::
        
          [distutils]
          index-servers =
        
        Note that after creating the tag we still ask you if you want to
        checkout that tag for tweaks or pypi/distutils server upload.  We
        could add some extra checks to see if that is really needed, but
        someone who does not have index-servers listed, may still want to use
        an entry point like `gocept.zestreleaser.customupload`_ to do
        uploading, or do some manual steps first before uploading.
        
        Some people will hardly ever want to do a release on PyPI but in 99
        out of 100 cases only want to create a tag.  They won't like the
        default answer of 'yes' to that question of whether to create a
        checkout of the tag.  So since version 3.16 you can influence this
        default answer.  You can add some lines to the ``.pypirc`` file in
        your home directory to change the default answer for all packages, or
        change it for individual packages in their ``setup.cfg`` file.  The
        lines are this::
        
          [zest.releaser]
          release = no
        
        You can use no/false/off/0 or yes/true/on/1 as answers; upper, lower
        or mixed case are all fine.
        
        
        Entrypoints documentation
        =========================
        
        **Warning**: *entry points were added in 3.0, I'm reserving the right to make
        backwards-incompatible changes to the entry point mechanism in the next couple
        of releases.  It is a major new piece of functionality for zest.releaser and
        getting all the details right at the first attempt isn't guaranteed.*
        
        A zest.releaser entrypoint gets passed a data dictionary and that's about it.
        You can do tasks like generating documentation.  Or downloading external files
        you don't want to store in your repository but that you do want to have
        included in your egg.
        
        Every release step (prerelease, release and postrelease) has three points
        where you can hook in an entry point:
        
        before
            Only the ``workingdir`` and ``name`` are available in the data
            dictionary, nothing has happened yet.
        
        middle
            All data dictionary items are available and some questions (like new
            version number) have been asked.  No filesystem changes have been made
            yet.
        
        after
            The action has happened, everything has been written to disk or uploaded
            to pypi or whatever.
        
        
        For the release step it made sense to create one extra entry point:
        
        after_checkout
            The middle entry point has been handled, the tag has been made, a
            checkout of that tag has been made and we are now in that checkout
            directory.  Of course, when the user chooses not to do a checkout,
            this entry point never triggers.
        
        Note that an entry point can be specific for one package (usually the
        package that you are now releasing) or generic for all packages.  An
        example of a generic one is `gocept.zestreleaser.customupload`_, which
        offers to upload the generated distribution to a chosen destination
        (like a server for internal company use).  If your entry point is
        specific for the current package only, you should add an extra check
        to make sure it is not run while releasing other packages; something
        like this should do the trick::
        
            def my_entry_point(data):
                if data['name'] != 'my.package':
                    return
                ...
        
        .. _`gocept.zestreleaser.customupload`: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/gocept.zestreleaser.customupload
        
        
        Entry point specification
        -------------------------
        
        An entry point is configured like this in your setup.py::
        
              entry_points={
                  #'console_scripts': [
                  #    'myscript = my.package.scripts:main'],
                  'zest.releaser.prereleaser.middle': [
                      'dosomething = my.package.some:some_entrypoint',
                      ]},
        
        Replace ``prereleaser`` and ``middle`` in ``zest.releaser.prereleaser.middle``
        with prerelease/release/postrelease and before/middle/after where needed.
        
        See the ``setup.py`` of ``zest.releaser`` itself for some real world examples.
        
        You'll have to make sure that the zest.releaser scripts know about your entry
        points, for instance by placing your egg (with entry point) in the same
        zc.recipe.egg section in your buildout as where you placed zest.releaser.  Or,
        if you installed zest.releaser globally, your egg-with-entrypoint has to be
        globally installed, too.
        
        
        Comments about data dict items
        ------------------------------
        
        Your entry point gets a data dictionary: the items you get in that dictionary
        are documented below.  Some comments about them:
        
        - Not all items are available.  If no history/changelog file is found, there
          won't be any ``data['history_lines']`` either.
        
        - Items that are templates are normal python string templates.  They use
          dictionary replacement: they're actually passed the same data dict.  For
          instance, prerelease's ``data['commit_message']`` is by default ``Preparing
          release %(new_version)s``.  A "middle" entry point could modify this
          template to get a different commit message.

        Changelog for zest.releaser
        ===========================
        
        3.31 (2012-02-23)
        -----------------
        
        - Fixed test for unadvised egg_info commands on tag, which could
          result in a ConfigParser error.
          [maurits]
        
        
        3.30 (2011-12-27)
        -----------------
        
        - Added some more PyPI classifiers.  Tested with Python 2.4, 2,4, 2.6,
          and 2.7.
          [maurits]
        
        - Moved changes of 3.15 and older to docs/HISTORY.txt.
          [maurits]
        
        - Added GPL license text in the package.
          [maurits]
        
        - Updated README.txt.  Added MANIFEST.in.
          [maurits]
        
        
        3.29 (2011-12-27)
        -----------------
        
        - In postrelease create a version number like 1.0.dev0.
          See http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0386
          [maurits]
        
        - Offer to cleanup setup.cfg on the tag when releasing.  You do not
          want tag_build or tag_svn_revision options in a release usually.
          [maurits]
        
        - For convenience also print the tag checkout location when only doing
          a release (instead of a fullrelease).
          [maurits]
        
        
        3.28 (2011-11-18)
        -----------------
        
        - Git: in pre/postrelease only check for uncommitted changes in files
          that are already tracked.
          [maurits]
        
        
        3.27 (2011-11-12)
        -----------------
        
        - Postrelease now offers (=asks) to push your changes to the server if you're
          using hg or git.
        
        - Support for some legacy projects, often converted from CVS, have multiple
          subprojects under a single trunk. The trunk part from the top level project
          isn't erroneously stripped out anymore. Thanks to Marc Sibson for the fix.
        
        
        3.26 (2011-11-01)
        -----------------
        
        - Added sanity check before doing a prerelease so you are warned when
          you are about to commit on a tag instead of a branch (or trunk or
          master).
          [maurits]
        
        
        3.25 (2011-10-28)
        -----------------
        
        - Removed special handling of subversion lower than 1.7 when searching
          for the history/changes file.  In corner cases it may be that we
          find a wrong HISTORY.txt or CHANGES.txt file when you have it buried
          deep in your directory structure.  Please move it to the root then,
          which is the proper place for it.
          [maurits]
        
        - Fixed finding a history/changes file that is in a sub directory when
          using subversion 1.7 or higher or bazaar.
          [maurits]
        
        
        3.24 (2011-10-19)
        -----------------
        
        - Note: you may need to install setuptools_subversion when you use
          subversion 1.7.  If you suddenly start missing files in the sdists
          you upload to PyPI you definitely need it.  Alternatively: set up a
          proper MANIFEST.in as that method works with any version control
          system.
          [maurits]
        
        - Made compatible with subversion 1.7 (the only relevant change is in
          the code that checks if a tags or tag directory already exists).
          Earlier versions of subversion are of course still supported.
          [maurits]
        
        - Code repository moved to github:
          https://github.com/zestsoftware/zest.releaser
          [maurits]
        
        
        3.23 (2011-09-28)
        -----------------
        
        - Fixed opening the html long description in ``longtest`` on Mac OS X
          Lion or python2.7 by using a ``file://`` url.
          Fixes https://bugs.launchpad.net/zest.releaser/+bug/858011
          [maurits]
        
        
        3.22 (2011-05-05)
        -----------------
        
        - Allow specifying a tag on the command line when using lasttaglog or
          lasttagdiff, to show the log or diff since that tag instead of the
          latest.  Useful when you are on a branch and the last tag was from
          trunk.
          [maurits]
        
        
        3.21 (2011-04-20)
        -----------------
        
        - Added lasttaglog command that list the log since the last tag.
          [maurits]
        
        - Fix Mercurial (hg) support. As spreaded_internal should be set
          to False (as it happens with git)
          [erico_andrei]
        
        - Accept a twiggle (or whatever '~' is called) when searching for
          headers in a changelog; seen in some packages (at least
          zopeskel.dexterity).
          [maurits]
        
        
        3.20 (2011-01-25)
        -----------------
        
        - Also allowing CHANGES.rst and CHANGES.markdown in addition to
          CHANGES.txt.
        
        
        3.19 (2011-01-24)
        -----------------
        
        - No longer refuse to register and upload a package on pypi if it is
          not there yet, forcing people to do this manually the first time.
          Instead, we ask the question and simply have 'No' as the default
          answer.  If you specify an answer, we require exactly typing 'yes'
          or 'no'.  The idea is still to avoid making it too easy to release
          an internal package on pypi by accident.  [maurits]
        
        
        3.18 (2010-12-08)
        -----------------
        
        - Added ``--non-interactive--`` option to the ``svn diff`` command used in
          lasttagdiff.  This makes it usable in cronjobs and post-commit hooks.
          Fixes https://bugs.launchpad.net/zest.releaser/+bug/687530
        
        
        3.17 (2010-11-17)
        -----------------
        
        - When the package that is being released neither has a setup.py nor a
          setup.cfg, use No as default answer for creating a checkout of the
          tag.
          [maurits]
        
        
        3.16 (2010-11-15)
        -----------------
        
        - For (pypi) output, also show the first few lines instead of only the
          last few.
          [maurits]
        
        - See if pypirc or setup.cfg has a [zest.releaser] section with option
          release = yes/no.  During the release stage, this influences the
          default answer when asked if you want to make a checkout of the tag.
          The default when not set, is 'yes'.  You may want to set this to
          'no' if most of the time you only make releaser of internal packages
          for customers and only need the tag.
          [maurits]
        
        - Specify bazaar (bzr) tag numbers using the 'tag' revision specifier
          (like 'tag:0.1') instead of only the tag number (0.1) to add
          compatibility with earlier bzr versions (tested with 2.0.2).
          [maurits]
