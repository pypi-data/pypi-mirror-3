Renders a go diagram.  This will take an ascii go diagram and return
an image node which points to the new image
   
Looks like:
  
.. go::

    $$ -----------
    $$ | . . . . .
    $$ | . 5 . a .
    $$ | . 3 2 . .
    $$ | 6 4 1 . .
    $$ | . . . . .

Until I get the image rendering working, it will just render straight 
ascii.
