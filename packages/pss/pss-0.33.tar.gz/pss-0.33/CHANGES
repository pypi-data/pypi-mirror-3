Changelog
=========

+ Version 0.33 (21.10.2011)

  - Issue #7: allow simple invocation of pss without installing, by directly
    passing the source directory to a Python interpreter.
  - Fixed a problem with the max-count option that was broken in some cases.
  - Fixed some encoding issues, and better handling of non-ASCII files when
    running on Python 3 (also reported in Issues #10 and #12). 
  - Issue #2: pss will now ignore broken symlinks (won't list them or try to
    read them).
  - Issue #5: When the output of pss is redirected, by default colors won't
    be applied (unless forced with --color).
  - Issue #6: Support -l and -L options (only show files with/without matches)
  - Issue #8: When Ctrl+C is hit, print a succinct error message instead of 
    the full stack trace.

+ Version 0.32 (14.10.2011)

  - Move pss.py from scripts/ to psslib/, leaving just a wrapper call to 
    pss.py's main() in scripts/pss.py and scripts/pss. This is better than
    the previous solution of having a symlink in scripts/ because pip on
    Python 2.6 doesn't handle symlinks too well.

+ Version 0.31 - Initial public release (14.10.2011)
