Helping Out
===========

If you want to add a feature or fix a bug, please go ahead! Fork the project
on `GitHub`_ and when you're done with your changes, let me know. Fixes and
features with tests have a greater chance of being merged. To run the tests,
do::

  cd /path/to/src/lazysignup
  python manage.py test lazysignup

Note that the tests require the `Mock`_ package.
