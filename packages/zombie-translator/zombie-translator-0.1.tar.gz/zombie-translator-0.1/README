Zombie Translator is the easiest way to understand and be understood by your zombie friends and neighbors.  It's simple, easy, and makes speaking zombie fun!


Installing
==========

```bash
pip install zombie-translator
```


Using
=====

```python
>>> from zombie_translator import to_zombish, from_zombish
>>> z = to_zombish("Hello, world!")
>>> print z
Bgbbnhnhhr, MrhrrrnhRA!
>>> print from_zombish(z)
"Hello, world!"
```

There's also an optional profanity filter that replaces a set of arguably 'bad' words with zombie-speak.  For example,

```python
>>> print from_zombish(to_zombish("Go to hell!"))
Go to GRAGH!
```

You can also turn off the profanity filter:
```python
>>> print from_zombish(to_zombish("Go to hell!", with_profanity_filter=False))
Go to hell!
```
