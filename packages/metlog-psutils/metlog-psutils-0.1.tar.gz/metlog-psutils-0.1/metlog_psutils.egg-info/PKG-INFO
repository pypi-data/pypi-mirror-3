        metlog-psutils is a plugin extension for `Metlog 
        <http://github.com/mozilla-services/metlog-py>`.  metlog-psutils
        provides details about network connections, memory usage, cpu usage
        and even some thread details.
        
        This plugin works best on Linux.  Running the plugin under OSX will
        skip some functionality and will require root privileges.
