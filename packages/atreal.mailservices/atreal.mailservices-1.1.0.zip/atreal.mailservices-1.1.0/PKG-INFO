        Overview
        ========
        
        MailServices allows to send emails to portal's users and groups.
        
        
        Description
        ===========
        
        * This very lightweight plone product let's you mailing people from your
         portal, by groups or by selecting users.
        
        * It equally allows you to mail people that are'nt members of the portals,
         but WITHOUT ANY VERIFICATION! (for the moment).
        
        * Otherwise, it adds a document action, which works in the
         same way that classic plone 'send_to' action, but let's you choosing your
         target by scanning the portal groups/users.
        
        * It also adds an user action, which works in the same way as described above.
        
        * Manager can choose in ControlPanel :
          - default subject,
          - default body,
          - if he will receive a copy of each mail sent,
          - if users are able to send mails to non-portal's users.
        
        * Mails are sent from user email address. For security purposes, this can't be
          modified.
         
         
        Important
        =========
        
        Permission is set for 'Manager and 'Member'
        
        
        Note
        ====
        
        Bcc support is currently implemented in a branche. However, due to MailHost behaviour,
        all recipients can see the bcc list.
        We are working on this issue, feel free to send your proposals in case you have some.
