PySCeS was initially developed as part of Brett's PhD under the supervision
of Jannie Hofmeyr and Johann Rohwer, both of whom who have
contributed an immeasurable amount to its design and implementation.

Chief contributors (in some sort of non-order) are:
Jannie Hofmeyr, Johann Rohwer, James Dominy, Lafras Uys

Testing, useful feedback and porting:
Morgan Hough, Charl Moller, Herbert Sauro
Ruchir Khandelwal, Evert Bosdriesz

I'm sure this list is incomplete and if you feel you've been left out,
contact me and I'll be happy to add you to it.
