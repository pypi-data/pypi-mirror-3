  [alecm]

- Prep release with fixed dependencies, and new adapter based relationship
  proxying.
  [alecm]

- Added support for relationships to proxy objects obtained using adaptation.
  [massimo]

- It's not safe to use 'not target' when target could be a content item (e.g.
  a folderish one for which an empty folder is false). The new code is now
  identical to the same pattern used in zc.relationship.
  [optilude]

- Update version and zc.relationship dependency.
  [alecm]

- Remove collective.testing dependency.
  [alecm]

- Use a savepoint not a full commit during test.
  [alecm]

- We no longer guarantee that the relation objects themselves are wrapped on
  retrieval, only that they can be wrapped as needed.
  [alecm]

- We need implicit acquisition in order to obtain getPhysicalRoot for
  workflow/template expressions.
  [alecm]

- Remove getPhysicalPath methods as they are no longer needed, make the str
  representation of relationships show something reasonable even if some of
  the sources/targets are missing.
  [alecm]

- Early contributions.
  [optilude, ramon, wichert]

- Initial implementation.
