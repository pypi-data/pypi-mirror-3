Description: # pymemc
        
        pymemc is a python binary memcached client.
        
        ## Why another memcache client?
            * uses the binary protocol
            * 100% native python
            * full featured (all mc functions supported w/ multi-equivalents)
            * tests
        
        ## Performance Comparison?
            * TODO (local + across net)
