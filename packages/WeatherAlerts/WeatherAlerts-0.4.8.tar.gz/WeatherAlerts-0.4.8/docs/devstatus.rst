Development Status
*******************

This project is in active development and is currently a working alpha release. Classes and Methods are being refactored as things grow so the codebase is moving around quite a bit. 
This will settle down once the project is 1.0 feature complete (whatever that is). 

Each commit on dev and master is built and tested on a continious integration server for python2.6, python2.7 and python3.2 currently these are simple nosetests coving core functionality, but these will be expanded as well.
