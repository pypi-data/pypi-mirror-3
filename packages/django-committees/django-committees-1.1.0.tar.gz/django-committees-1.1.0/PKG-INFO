        A simple pluggable django application for managing documents in a small not-for-profit organization.
        
        At a small organization, we have a governing board, composed of variable-length termed seats, term limits, alternate members, offices: a president, vice president, secretary and treasurer. The rest of the governing is done via committees, wether standing or ad-hoc. The whole government is governed by bylaws and policies. This app should organize all these elements in one place for reference.
