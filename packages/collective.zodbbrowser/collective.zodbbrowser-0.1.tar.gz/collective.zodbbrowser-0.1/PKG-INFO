Description: ============
        Introduction
        ============
        
        Collective.ZodbBrowser is a web application to browse, inspect and introspect Zope's zodb objects. It is inspired on smalltalk's class browser and zodbbrowsers for zope3. 
        
        There is a demo video available at `YouTube's menttes channel
        <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOpdnC5zvs/>`_. 
        
        ====================================
        Using ZodbBrowser with your buildout
        ====================================
        
        If you already have a buildout for Plone3 or Plone4 running, edit 
        buildout.cfg to add collective.zodbbrowser to eggs and zcml sections at buildout
        and instance parts respectively.
        
        ::
        
          [buildout]
          ...
          eggs = collective.zodbbrowser
          ...
        
        Autoinclude is automatically configured to work in Plone but if you are using 
        any other systems, make sure to add a zcml slug::
        
          ...
          [instance]
          ...
          zcml = collective.zodbbrowser
        
        Then run bin/buildout to make the changes effective.
