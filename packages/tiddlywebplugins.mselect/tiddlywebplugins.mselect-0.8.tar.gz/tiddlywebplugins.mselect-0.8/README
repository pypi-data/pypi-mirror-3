This is a TiddlyWeb plugin which extends the TiddlyWeb filter syntax 
to add 'mselect' which provides multiple selects in one selection. The
following example will select those tiddlers which have tag blog OR tag
published and then sort by modified time:

    mselect=tag:blog,tag:published;sort=-modified
