Description: This product adds a pt_filled_slots methods to page templates, so it
        is possible from within or before a filled slot see which slots are
        filled by the calling page template.
        
        For example "python:'content-core' in template.pt_filled_slots" could
        be called to see if content-core is defined.
        
        After discovering some security-related issues with this approach
        (access denied) I've also added the option of setting up the method as
        an External Method:
        
         ID: pt_filled_slots
         Module name: Products.PageTemplateFilledSlots.pt_filled_slots
         Function name: pt_filled_slots
        
        And this is called via for example "python:'content-core' in
        context.pt_filled_slots(template)" in a page template.
