"""
Get name#type@category for each given components@list given.

Such a module MUST define a get_guesser(param) function (see below).
This function will be called by the sequencer (DGM and chain stages)
to get the type and the category of given components.

If a component in the given list already has the form:
name#type@category it will be returned as is. Otherwise, this guesser
implementation just returns exotic@alien for each component given
meaning that neither type nor category is known.

Note however that nodeset are supported:

For example, for: bullx[2-3] bullx14#compute@node the following
strings will be returned:

bullx2#exotic@alien
bullx3#exotic@alien
bullx14#compute@node
