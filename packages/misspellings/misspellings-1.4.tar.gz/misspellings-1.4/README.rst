Spell checker for code
======================

This is a Python library and tool to check for misspelled words in
source code. It does this by looking for words from a list of
common misspellings. The dictionary it uses to do this is based
on the Wikipedia list of common misspellings.

* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Lists_of_common_misspellings/For_machines

The list has been slightly modified to remove some changes that
cause a number of false positives. In particular ``ok->OK`` was
removed (ok is frequently used in perl tests for instance).

Example
=======
To try it out, merely run the following (using the coreutils
source tree as an example)::

    $ git clone git://git.sv.gnu.org/coreutils -b v8.10 coreutils
    $ find coreutils -name '*.c' | misspellings -f -
    coreutils/src/cat.c[754]: efficency -> "efficiency"
    coreutils/src/comm.c[198]: funtion -> "function"
    coreutils/src/expr.c[21]: seperate -> "separate"
    coreutils/src/pr.c[1417]: accomodate -> "accommodate"
    coreutils/src/tac.c[342]: unneccessary -> "unnecessary"
    coreutils/src/test.c[91]: supressed -> "suppressed"

Contributions
=============

Contributions are welcome! Please add unit tests for new features
or bug fixes. To run all the unit tests run ``./setup test``.

Unit tests are run on `Travis`_ for all supported python versions.
