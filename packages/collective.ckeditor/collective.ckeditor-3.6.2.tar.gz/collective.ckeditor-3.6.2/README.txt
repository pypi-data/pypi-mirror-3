If you really need ckeditor for Plone3 contact us support@ingeniweb.com

You can always use FCKeditor for Plone.


Development
===========

After checking out from svn, run the buildout included in the checkout.

This installs ``copy_ckeditor_code`` script. This script takes care of copying
ckeditor code in the appropriate ``browser/ckeditor`` directory.

The ``browser/ckeditor`` directory makes ckeditor javascript code available to
the browser at::

  http://yourplonesite/++resource++ckeditor/

You need to run ``bin/copy_ckeditor_code`` prior to run any Zope/Plone instance
with your development ``collective.ckeditor``.
Anyway, if you forget, your instance will break with a ``ConfigurationError``::
  
  Directory .../browser/ckeditor does not exist.
  
Release
=======

Obviously, the ckeditor code also needs to be included in the released eggs.

``collective.ckeditor`` registers an entry point for ``zest.releaser`` that (if
called properly) takes care of copying the code when preparing the release.

However, in order to take advantage of the entry point, you have to use the 
``bin/fullrelease`` locally installed by the development buildout instead of 
a globally installed ``fullrelease``. 

Only the local ``bin/fullrelease`` script can see the entry_point registered by
``collective.ckeditor``.
