        Zookeeper Tools
        ===============
        
        ``zktools`` is a package of tools implementing higher level constructs using
        `Apache Zookeeper`_.
        
        It currently provides:
        
        * ``Configuration`` - Zookeeper Configuration Helpers
          to store and load configuration information stored
          in Zookeeper nodes.
        * ``Locks`` - A Zookeeper lock with support for
          non-blocking acquire, modeled on Python's Lock objects that also includes a
          `Revocable Shared Locks with Freaking Laser Beams` described in the 
          `Zookeeper Recipe's 
          <http://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/current/recipes.html#sc_recoverableSharedLocks>`_.
        
        See `the full docs`_ for more  information.

        Changelog
        =========
        
        0.2.1 (02/16/2012)
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed packaging bug.
        
        
        0.2 (02/03/2012)
        ----------------
        
        Changes
        *******
        
        - Added context manager return to lock to allow use of the 'with'
          statement.
        - Refactored to use zc.zk ZooKeeper library for higher level Zookeeper
          abstraction with automatic watch re-establishment.
        
        Features
        ********
        
        - Node object to retrieve ZNode data from Zookeeper and keep it up
          to date.
        - Node objects can have data and children subscribers.
        - NodeDict object that maps a shallow tree (one level of children)
          into a dict-like object.
        
        Backward Incompatibilities
        **************************
        
        - SharedZkLock has been refactored into ZkWriteLock and ZkReadLock.
        - ``revoked`` is a property of Locks, not a method.
        - ZkConnection is gone, lock objects, ZkNode, and ZkNodeDict all expect
          zc.zk ZooKeeper instances.
        
        
        0.1 (11/22/2011)
        ----------------
        
        Features
        ********
        
        - Lock implementation, with revokable shared locks.
        - Zookeeper connection object with automatic reconnect.
