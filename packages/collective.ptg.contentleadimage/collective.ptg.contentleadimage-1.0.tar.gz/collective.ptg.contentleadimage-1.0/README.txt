Introduction
============


This product provides an adapter for collective.plonetruegallery to display
contentleadimages from collective.contentleadimage.

In the weird case where an object is an image (provides IImageContent) and
also has a contentleadimage, the contentleadimage is the one displayed in the
gallery.


Installation
============

Just add this product to buildout's eggs, or install it in python path. Does
not require any installation in Plone.
