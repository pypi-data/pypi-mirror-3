        - Simplified the `demo site <http://foundation.chrisdev.com>`_
        - Updated documentation to reflect the use of Foundation 3
        - Numerous bug fixes.
        
        Quickstart
        -----------
        Create a virtual environment for your project and activate it::
        
            $ virtualenv mysite-env
            $ source mysite-env/bin/activate
            (mysite-env)$
            
        Next install Pinax::
        
            (mysite-env)$ pip install Pinax
            
        Once Pinax is installed use **pinax-admin**  to create a project for your site
        ::
        
            (mysite-env)$ pinax-admin setup_project mysite -b basic mysite
        
        The example above will create a starter Django project in the mysite folder based on the Pinax **basic** project.
        Of course you can use any of the Pinax starter Projects.  
        The **basic** project provides features such as account management, user profiles and notifications. 
        The starter project also comes with a **theme** or a collection css, javascript files.  
        The default theme is based on Twitter Bootstrap. 
        
        To use the **Foundation** theme in the project, include "pinax-theme-foundation" in requirements/project.txt. 
        Either install the package individually. ::
            
            pip install pinax-theme-foundation
            
        Or use the requirements file::
        
            pip install -r requirements/project.txt
            
           
        Next edit the **settings.py** file and 
        comment out the entry for "pinax_theme_bootstrap" and add "pinax_theme_foundation" in your INSTALLED APPS::
             
            # theme
            #"pinax_theme_bootstrap",
            "pinax_theme_foundation",
        
        Inside your project run::
        
            (mysite-env)$ python manage.py syncdb
            (mysite-env)$ python manage.py runserver
        
        
        Templates
        ^^^^^^^^^^
        The Pinax *setup_project* creates a *site_base.html* template which extends *theme_base.html*. 
        Your own templates should generally inherit from *site_base.html*.  Due to
        some inconsistencies between Bootstrap and Foundation you may need to perform an additional step
        to ensure that the top nav bar is displays properly.
        If have created a **basic** project you need to 
        edit the generated *site_base.html* to remove the extra
        *ul* tags found in the *{% nav block %}*. In the *basic* project  *{% nav block %}* 
        contains the profile and notices drop down menu items.  
        The generated project's   *site_base.html*  will contain ::
            
            {% block nav %}
        		{% if user.is_authenticated %}
        		<ul>{% spaceless %}
        			<li id="tab_profile"><a href="{% url profile_detail user.username %}">{% trans "Profile" %}</a></li>
        			<li id="tab_notices"><a href="{% url notification_notices %}">{% trans "Notices" %}{% if notice_unseen_count %} ({{ notice_unseen_count }}){% endif %}</a></li>
        			{% endspaceless %}
        		 </ul>
        		{% endif %}
           {% endblock %}
        
        You need to remove the *ul* tags so the block looks like ::
        
        	 {% block nav %}
        		{% if user.is_authenticated %}
        			<li id="tab_profile"><a href="{% url profile_detail user.username %}">{% trans "Profile" %}</a></li>
        			<li id="tab_notices"><a href="{% url notification_notices %}">{% trans "Notices" %}{% if notice_unseen_count %} ({{ notice_unseen_count }}){% endif %}</a></li>
        		{% endif %}
        	  % endblock %}
        
        
        
        You should provide your own "footer" template _footer.html
        
        Also change the Site name by editing *fixture/initial_data.json*  you can also use the Admin app for this purpose. 
        The **url** name "home" should be defined as the homepage.
        
        
        Upgrading Previous Version
        ---------------------------
        To upgrade you site start by upgrading to the latest version on pinax-theme-foundation ::
          
            pip install -- upgrade pinax-theme-foundation 
        
        The big change between Foundation 2 to 3 is the grid. In Foundation 3 you no longer have to use *.container*
        to define the grid. In Foundation 2 the grid was built around 
        *.container > .row > .columns* in Foundation 3 you now just have to use *.row > .columns*.
        
        Also it is important to note that in Foundation 3 padding and borders no longer increase the width of an element, 
        they only go inward, so for example, *.three.columns* always has a width of 25% 
        with a 15px padding on the left and right.
        
        In Foundation 2 it was common to override the *max-width* css styling. This is no longer necessary.
        
        You may find the Foundation 3 migration guide `here <http://foundation.zurb.com/migration.php>`_
