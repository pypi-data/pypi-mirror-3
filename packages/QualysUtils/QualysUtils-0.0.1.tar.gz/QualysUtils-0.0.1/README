This is python-qualysutils. A Python package that provides logic and data

Code in this library builds upon the low-level connection code available in
the python-qualysconnect package.  See:

== Installation ==

$ python setup.py install

NOTE: If you would like to experiment without installing globally, look into 'virtualenv'.

=== Requirements ===

You will need lxml installed for XML parsing in qhostinfo.py to work.

I've only tested this with Python 2.x.  I will need to test it with Python 3.x.
