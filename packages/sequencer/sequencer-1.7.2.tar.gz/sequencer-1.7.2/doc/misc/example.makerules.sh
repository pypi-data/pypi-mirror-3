# This shell script creates a ruleset designed to test the following use case:
# a#doubledep@soft -> (b#leaf@soft, c#singledep@soft)
# d#doubledep@soft -> (e#leaf@soft, f#singledep@soft)
# c#singledep@soft -> e#leaf@soft
# f#singledep@soft -> b#leaf@soft

# Note that actions are just echo with a sleep.  If you want to
# display the dependency graph graphically, do not use special
# characters in rules column (especially ':' and '"' have special
# meaning in the DOT graph format which make them unusable in
# actions).

# The rules are *added* to the sequencer. In particular, if the same
# script is run twice, on the same ruleset, errors will happened
# because rules with same name are forbidden in a given
# ruleset. Remove the ruleset beforehand, or use another ruleset.
# Note also that the sequencer table must exist beforehand. Use
# 'dbm-sequencer create_table' if required.

# Let suppose a db is available as cdbpv:
# The following command:
# $ dbm-sequencer -b cdbpv remove test
# Remove all rules from the 'test' ruleset in the cdbpv database
# Then:
# $ /usr/share/doc/sequencer/example.makerules.sh -b cdbpv test
# Insert rules into the database. Watch them with:
# $ dbm-sequencer -b cdbpv show
# Finally, you can run an execution on (virtual) components: 'a' and 'd':
# $ sequencer  test -b cdbpv a#doubledep@soft d#doubledep@soft

# Different ordering algorithms are available: use the option --algo
# along with the --stats to see that different algorithms provide
# different results.

# The 'seq' algorithm will give a speedup of around 1.00. It is
# sequential.

# The 'mixed' algorithm will give a speedup of around 1.55. It mixex
# sequential and parallel instructions.

# The 'par' algorithm (default when chaining) will give a speedup of
# around 2.00. By nature, 'par' produces only parallel instructions
# with explicit dependencies.

# In the example above, a will be executed as soon as b and c have
# finished with the 'par' algorithm, hence 3 seconds after the
# start. While in the 'mixed' case, a will have to wait for both f and
# c so, 5 seconds after the start.

# Note however that action 'f' will return a WARNING code
# (=75). Therefore, action that depends on it (action d actually) will
# not be executed unless option '--Force' is given on execution. This
# is to show the error management of the sequencer.
