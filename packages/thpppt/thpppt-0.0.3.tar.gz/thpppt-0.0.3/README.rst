Q: So, what's this about then?
==============================

Thpppt lets you make a quick start to your shiny new project by saving you tiresome typing.

Q: So, like, a scaffolding/boilerplate/skeleton thing then?
===========================================================

Exactly that.

Q: So this would be what, the 54th PyPi project to solve this "problem" then?
=============================================================================

Yeah, about that. Not even counting all the versions of this in other languages...

Q: Oh right. Well, I'll let you know
====================================

To be honest, Thpppt is more about writing a sample application for this other library [1] that I've
written than it is about "Solving" this "Problem". You know, in order to DogFood the API.
