Description: =======================================================
        PyVEP: a python library for the Verified Email Protocol
        =======================================================
        
        This is a python client library for the Verified Email Protocol, a.k.a
        Mozilla's BrowserID project.  See here for details:
        
            https://wiki.mozilla.org/Identity/Verified_Email_Protocol
        
        And see here for how to integrate it into your website:
        
            https://browserid.org/
        
        To just get something stable and working, it's currently recommended that you
        use the browserid.org remote verifier service to check your assertions. Do
        so like this::
        
            >>> verifier = vep.RemoteVerifier()
            >>> data = verifier.verify(BROWSERIDASSERTION, "http://mysite.com")
            >>> print data["email"]
            "test@example.com"
        
        
        For improved performance, or if you just want to live on the bleeding edge,
        you can perform verification locally like so::
        
            >>> verifier = vep.LocalVerifier()
            >>> data = verifier.verify(BROWSERIDASSERTION, "http://mysite.com")
            >>> print data["email"]
            "test@example.com"
        
        As the Verified Email Protocol gets locked down more firmly, using the local
        verifier will become the preferred method of checking VEP identity assertions.
        
        
        0.2.0 - 2011-12-07
        ==================
        
         * do more validation of the assertion before checking the certificates,
           to avoid expensive crypto ops for things we know to be invalid.
         * implement DummyVerifier class to aid in testing, both of this package
           and of packages that are using PyVEP.
         * add exception hierarchy in vep.errors, so that calling code can easily
           tell why verification failed.
        
        
        0.1.1 - 2011-12-01
        ==================
        
         * add "diresworb.org" to default list of trusted secondaries.
         * implement additional signature algorithms.
         * if "hostname/.well-known/host-meta" gives a 404, fall back to "hostname/pk"
           to find the public key.
        
        
        0.1.0 - 2011-11-23
        ==================
        
         * initial release.
