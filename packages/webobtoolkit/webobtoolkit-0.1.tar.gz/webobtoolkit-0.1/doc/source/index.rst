   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

=========================
 Welcome to webobtoolkit
=========================

The intent of webob toolkit is to provide and demonstrate how webob
and wsgi can be used as an HTTP client. This documentation may not
follow the conventions like you may be used to. Instead of telling you
how to use it, we will first tell you how it works. 

Why you ask? because any level of abstraction will fail you one day no
matter how good the library or framework is(even this one). When you get to that
point, the more you know, the less difficult it will be to get around
those failings.
