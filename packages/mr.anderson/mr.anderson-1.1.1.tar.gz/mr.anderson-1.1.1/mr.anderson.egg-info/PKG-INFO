        ===========
        
        A commandline utility for building Plone testing instances. It was created
        to aid in automated testing of packages in the Plone landscape.
        
        This package provides a script called ``redpill``. The script is used to
        create a Plone configuration. See ``redpill --help`` for more information.
        
        Using ``redpill`` without any options will create configuration for the latest
        released version of Plone 4.
