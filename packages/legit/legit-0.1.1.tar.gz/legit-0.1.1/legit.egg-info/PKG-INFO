        Legit: Git for Humans
        =====================
        
        Inspired by GitHub for Mac.
        
        
        The Concept
        -----------
        
        `GitHub for Mac <http://mac.github.com>`_ is not just a Git client.
        
        This `comment <http://www.hackerne.ws/item?id=2684483>`_ on Hacker News
        says it best:
        
            They haven't re-created the git CLI tool in a GUI, they've created something different. They've created a tool that makes Git more accessible. Little things like auto-stashing when you switch branches will confuse git veterans, but it will make Git much easier to grok for newcomers because of the assumptions it makes about your Git workflow.
        
        Why not bring this innovation back to the command line?
        
        
        The Interface
        -------------
        
        ``branches``
            Get a nice pretty list of available branches.
        
        ``sync [<branch>]``
            Syncronizes the given branch. Defaults to current branch.
            Stash, Fetch, Auto-Merge/Rebase, Push, and Unstash.
            You can only sync published branches.
        
        ``switch <branch>``
            Switches to specified branch.
            Defaults to current branch.
            Automatically stashes and unstashes any changes.
        
        ``sprout [<branch>] <new-branch>``
            Creates a new branch off of the specified branch.
            Swiches to it immediately.
        
        ``harvest [<branch>] <new-branch>``
            Creates a new branch off of the specified branch.
            Swiches to it immediately.
        
        ``graft <branch> <into-branch>``
            Auto-Merge/Rebase of specified branch into the second branch.
        
        ``publish <branch>``
            Publishes specified branch to the remote.
        
        ``unpublish <branch>``
            Removes specified branch from the remote.
        
        ``install``
            Installs legit git aliases.
        
        
        The Installation
        ----------------
        
        Installing Legit is easy with pip::
        
            $ pip install legit
        
        You'll then have the wonderful ``legit`` command available. Run it within
        a repository.
        
        To install the git aliases, run the following command::
        
            $ legit install
        
        
        Caveats
        -------
        
        - All remote operations are carried out by the first remote found.
        - If a ``stash pop`` merge fails, Legit stops. I'd like to add checking for a merge failure, and undo the command with friendly error reporting.
        - Pip install is cumbersome to people unfamiliar with Python. Package. (Py2App + PyInstaller)
