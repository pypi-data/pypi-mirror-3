Description: This is the **Zope2 integration** for `YAFOWIL
        <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/yafowil>`_
        
        Functionality
        =============
        
        Browser Resources
        -----------------
        
        Plugins may provide custom javascript, css, images (and so on). This package
        registers the directory containing them as a resource-directory. Thus they can
        be accessed from the webbrowser. The schema is
        ``+++resource++MODULENAME/filename.ext``. I.e. if ``yafowil.widget.autocomplete``
        is available its javascript can be accessed with
        ``http://localhost:8080/Plone/++resource++yafowil.widget.autocomplete/widget.js``.
        
        Integration with Plone and GenericSetup
        ---------------------------------------
        
        There a profile ``YAFOWIL`` available registering all browser resources in css 
        and javascript registries.
        
        The resources are registred without any thridparty dependencies (i.e. dependend
        javascript libraries).
        
        Integration with Translation
        ----------------------------
        
        The package adds an translation method for Zope2 i18n messages. Its added using
        a global preprocessor
        
        
        Request wrapper
        ---------------
        
        This package registers a global preprocessor for YAFOWIL. It wraps the Zope2
        request by an own request instance providing the behavior expected by YAFOWIL.
        Spezial behaviors:
        
        - File Uploads provided by Zope2 as ``ZPublisher.HTTPRequest.Fileupload``
          objects are turned into Dicts with the keys:
        
          file
              file-like object to read data from
        
          filename
              submitted name of the upload
        
          mimetype
              type of the upload
        
          headers
              all headers
        
          original
              keeps the original ``ZPublisher.HTTPRequest.Fileupload`` object
        
        Source Code
        ===========
        
        The sources are in a GIT DVCS with its main branches at
        `github <http://github.com/bluedynamics/yafowil.plone>`_.
        
        We'd be happy to see many forks and pull-requests to make YAFOWIL even better.

        1.2
        ---
        
        - rename to yafowil.plone - seems a 2 at the end of a package name confuses 
          easy_install. wtf!?

        1.1
        ---
        
        - depend on yafowil 1.3 in setup.py and bump version.
          [jensens, 2012-03-20]
        
        1.0
        ---
        
        - Resources are registered using the new plugin infrastructure.
          Theres now an import step for generic setup registering all javascripts and
          stylesheets provided by the plugins. They are registred without any 
          thirdparty dependencies. If a resource is already registered its registration 
          is skipped. Such its possible to register or overide the defaults using xml
          files.
