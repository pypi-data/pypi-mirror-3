Description: Jasy - Web Tooling Framework
        ============================
        
        Jasy is a powerful Python3-based tooling framework. It makes it 
        easy to manage heavy web projects. Its main goal is to offer 
        an API which could be used by developers to write their custom 
        build/deployment scripts.
        
        
        ## Installation
        
        ### Using Binary Packages
        
        There are [pre-built packages available for either Windows or Mac](https://github.com/zynga/jasy/downloads) 
        users. 
        
        Download the ZIP file and unpack it inside our download folder. Then either run `install.sh` (Mac) or `activate.bat` (Windows).
        
        
        ### Custom Installation
        
        You can also install Jasy on your own. Jasy has a few dependencies
        like Python 3, Misaka (Markdown), Msgpack (API data), etc. For
        details have a look at [the official documentation](https://github.com/zynga/jasy/wiki/Installation).
        
        
        ## Authors
        
        Jasy was initially developed by [Sebastian Werner](mailto:info@sebastian-werner.net)
        and is now continued as an official Zynga OpenSource project.
