Introduction
============

This library packages `suggest.js`_ for `fanstatic`_.

.. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
.. _`suggest.js`: http://www.enjoyxstudy.com/javascript/suggest/index.en.html

This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
directory in ``js.suggest``) are published to some URL.
