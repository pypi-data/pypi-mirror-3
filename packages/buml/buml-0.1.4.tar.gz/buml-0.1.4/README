buml Markup Language and Processor
----------------------------------

*buml* consists of **highly configurable** **block** and **inline
markup languages** and makes it **easy to process documents** from a source
form to a final form with **your own custom markup behavior**.  **Pluggable
writers** can render the parse tree in different output formats--at the moment
an **XML/HTML writer** is supplied.  

See the `documentation <http://bruegger.it/buml/>`_ for details.
