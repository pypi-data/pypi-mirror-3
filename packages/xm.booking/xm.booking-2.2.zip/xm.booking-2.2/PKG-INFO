Description: xm.booking
        ==========
        
        This is a package for booking hours on a content type.  It also
        handles estimates of duration or size.  It is a spin-off from
        eXtremeManagement.  Quite likely some more code needs to move between
        those two.
        
        xm.booking is intended to be useful without eXtremeManagement.  But
        for now the bookings from Products.eXtremeManagement.content.Bookings
        are used.  In place of that we want to make a nice and small Zope 3
        content object.  Of course this needs migration code in
        eXtremeManagement.
        
        Conversely, eXtremeManagement depends on xm.booking, so if you change
        this package, please also run the eXtremeManagement tests.  If unsure,
        please contact the eXtremeManagement authors or mailing list.  See
        http://plone.org/products/extreme-management-tool/
        
        The code is hosted at https://github.com/zestsoftware/xm.booking
        
        History of xm.booking
        =====================
        
        2.2 (2012-09-12)
        ----------------
        
        - Moved to github.
          [maurits]
        
        
        2.1 (2011-02-03)
        ----------------
        
        - Added missing return statement in the size_estimate indexer.
          You may want to recatalog the Stories to fix their size_estimate.
          [maurits]
        
        
        2.0 (2010-09-24)
        ----------------
        
        - Made booking table compatible with both Plone 3 and 4, by using
          either poi_niceName (Plone 3, Poi 1.2) or @@pas_member (Plone4).
          [maurits]
        
        - Explicitly load the permissions.zcml file from
          Products.eXtremeManagement, otherwise you might get a
          ComponentLookupError on zope startup.
          [maurits]
        
        - Added z3c.autoinclude.plugin target plone.
          [maurits]
        
        - Use plone.indexer instead of the deprecated
          registerIndexableAttribute which no longer works in Plone 4.  Added
          dependency on plone.indexer for this, so using Plone 3.3 is
          recommended (might still work on earlier versions).
          [maurits]
        
        
        1.1 (2010-05-01)
        ----------------
        
        - Avoid renaming bookings that were added via the tracker at the
          moment you edit them.
          Fixes http://plone.org/products/extreme-management-tool/issues/184
          [maurits]
        
        
        1.0 (2009-05-05)
        ----------------
        
        - Protect the booking table with the eXtremeManagement: View Details
          permission.  [maurits+mike]

        0.7 (2008-10-06)
        ----------------
        
        - Fixed error where a day=DateTime() default argument in a method defintion
          would get stuck with the DateTime() of the moment when the site was last
          started, sigh. KSS-added bookings all got that date. Fixes
          http://plone.org/products/extreme-management-tool/issues/80. [reinout]
        
        
        0.6 (2008-09-16)
        ----------------
        
        - Added optional argument 'description' to create_booking.  [maurits]
        
        - Showing booking's description as 'structure' as it is handled as
          webintelligent text in Products.eXtremeManagement's views now. [reinout]
