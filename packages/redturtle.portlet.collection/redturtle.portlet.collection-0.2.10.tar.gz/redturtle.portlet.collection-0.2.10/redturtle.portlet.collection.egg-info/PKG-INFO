Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        A collection portlet that use a custom view template to show search results.
        
        User must manually put inside the "*Template Id*" field of the portlet the id of a Zope Page Template,
        commonly available in *portal_skins*.
        
        Seems crappy?
        -------------
        
        Yes, this is not very user friendly, but this product save us from developing a lot of
        collection portlet clones!
        
        Create you own template
        -----------------------
        
        Is simple, but start from the example you find in this product: check the
        *base_collection_portlet_view.pt* file.
