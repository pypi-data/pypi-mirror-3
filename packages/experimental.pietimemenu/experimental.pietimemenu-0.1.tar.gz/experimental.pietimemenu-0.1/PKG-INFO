Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This product replaces all archetype time inputs with radial (also
        known as circular or pie) menues.
        
        
        The time drop down is a pita, a radial menu saves a lot of mouse moves.
        The radial menu is easy to grasp after all the display is pretty much
        the same as an analogue clock.
        
        The js is short (~4.3k uncompressed) and no changes to the current
        time input is required. It is fully customizable with css, very few
        assumption are made in the code.
        It falls back to the 'classic' drop down menus on browsers w/o js.
        
        It implements Fitts’ law, which…
        
        [...] is a model of human movement primarily used in human–computer
        interaction and ergonomics that predicts that the time required to
        rapidly move to a target area is a function of the distance to the
        target and the size of the target.- Wikipedia
