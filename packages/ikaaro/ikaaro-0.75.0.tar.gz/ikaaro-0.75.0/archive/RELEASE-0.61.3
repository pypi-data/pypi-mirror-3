ikaaro 0.61.3 (2010/06/10)
==========================

This is a Content Management System built on Python & itools, among
other features ikaaro provides:

 - content and document management (index&search, metadata, etc.)
 - multilingual user interfaces and content
 - high level modules: wiki, forum, tracker, etc.

With this release the old external editor, zopeedit.py [1], has been
replaced by restedit.py [2].  The new method is restful, it replaces
the locking mechanism by an optimistic approach based in timestamps,
which integrates better with the rest of ikaaro.

Now the configuration file requires the listen-address and listen-port
variables to be set.  It is possible again to listen to any interface,
to do so the listen-address variable must be set to the "*" value.

The locale files have been updated and slimmed.

The code has been optimized a little, now ui handlers are cached.

Several bugs have been fixed, including #816, #869 and #892
