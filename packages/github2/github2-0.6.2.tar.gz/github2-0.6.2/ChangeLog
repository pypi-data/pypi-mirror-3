Changelog
=========

v0.6.2 (2012-06-11)
-------------------

- Include ChangeLog in sdist generated tarballs. [James Rowe]

- Minor fixes to quickstart doc. [James Rowe]

  This makes the usage far closer to what a user would expect in an
  interactive session.

- Rewording of the API v3 migration note. [James Rowe]

  There has been a reprieve for the API v2 switch-off, and the note from
  3414c22d25a54624e554be5bdb8a6fb327ff27d7 is no longer as urgent.

- Re-sync dependencies in tox config. [James Rowe]

- Fixed simplejson dependency for Python 2.4. [James Rowe]

  Recent versions of simplejson no longer support Python 2.4.

  This would have failed in the case where an OS is supported, but the
  certs weren't available.

- Document automatic proxy config with httplib2-0.7.4. [James Rowe]

  Closes #75.

- Use 'project' for link references in wild doc. [James Rowe]

  Didn't really like the 'Git repository' look.

- Added a warning to the intro docs for pending API switch-off. [James
  Rowe]

  This creates problems when other parts of a runtime are using httplib2

  Would still be far easier timedelta.total_seconds(), but Python <2.7

  This is what pre-commit hooks supposed to be used for ;)

- Don't require sphinxcontrib-cheeseshop for running setup. [James Rowe]

  It is considerably more likely a user will just want to install the
  package and not also build the documentation, unfortunately there
  isn't a depend string purely for the build_sphinx command.

- Document the Organization.plan attribute. [James Rowe]

- Revert "Removed unusable Organization.is_authenticated method." [James
  Rowe]

  This reverts commit f7ecb543b2bf9d67da4e18674d461fd229a38590.  It
  absolutely does work, I just failed miserably at testing it correctly
  earlier :/

- Document github.users.show('') usage. [James Rowe]

  This also marks the github.repos.list(None) usage as deprecated, it
  only worked for username/api_token authentication anyway.

  Needs examples.

- Decorated appropriate API calls with @requires_auth. [James Rowe]

- Added requires_auth decorator for marking API calls. [James Rowe]

- Always write all files in build_sphinx. [James Rowe]

  This is important because autodoc doesn't force a rebuild if source
  changes.

- Build all standard archive formats with build_dist command. [James
  Rowe]

- Enabled support for build_sphinx command. [James Rowe]

- Include user install option in pip example. [James Rowe]

- Use nose.collector with setuptools test. [James Rowe]

  This makes the behaviour very similar to the preferred nosetests
  commands.

- Renamed unit.py so nose collects the tests by default. [James Rowe]

- Give a descriptive error when HttpMock returns 404. [James Rowe]

- Keep Sphinx .static dir to silence warning. [James Rowe]

- Link to the install document in quickstart. [James Rowe]

  It is apparently quite confusing to read the docs with python-
  github2/github2 used in various places.

- Coverage is required for default testenv. [James Rowe]

- Moved versionadded directive to pull request class. [James Rowe]

  Renames new to create to match other methods.

  request ;)

- Fixed discussion/comments handling for pull requests. [James Rowe]

- Updated pull request date handling. [James Rowe]

- Added simple ISO-8601 parsing for pull request usage. [James Rowe]

- Added custom settings for nose. [James Rowe]

- Added setuptools upload_docs config setting. [James Rowe]

- This package is zip safe. [James Rowe]

  Doesn't make it a good enough reason to use eggs though ;)

- Added versionadded Sphinx directives where possible. [James Rowe]

  Some functions have received enough churn that it is too much work to
  track down their initial supported version unfortunately.

- Ignore coverage data file. [James Rowe]

- Remove ez_setup fallback for users without setuptools. [James Rowe]

  The ezsetup setuptools installer hasn't been shipped in any released
  version, so people can't be relying on it.  If it needs to come back
  at some point use `distribute_setup` in its place.

- Set package keywords for PyPI use. [James Rowe]

- USe setuptools for running unittests. [James Rowe]

- Include NEWS.rst in setuptools' long description. [James Rowe]

- Added operations to list labels and to search issues by label.
  [Barthelemy Dagenais]

- Fixed the datetime format for the DateAttributes. [Christopher
  MacGown]

- Adds support for Github API pull requests. [Christopher MacGown]

- URL escaping the path portion of the request to allow for better label
  naming. [Josh Weinberg]

- Minor PEP 8 compliance changes. [James Rowe]

- Small formatting fixes for README. [James Rowe]

- Added issue editing example. [James Rowe]

- Added issue reopening example. [James Rowe]

- Added issue searching example. [James Rowe]

- Encode search terms for issues. [James Rowe]

  This was already added users.search(see c079bbff), so I shouldn't have
  missed this.

- Document the pushables() call. [Vincent Driessen]

- Added authors. [Vincent Driessen]

- Revert "GitHub's API changed the date format tonight." [Vincent
  Driessen]

  This reverts commit 431bd8d8b70fe3ba212ecd5b2ae2274b03714915.  The
  change was an accidental change to GitHub's production service when
  they pushed out the new organisation API.  It has been reverted to the
  old situation, so this fix isn't necessary anymore.

- Document the new access_token arg in GitHub's constructor. [Vincent
  Driessen]

- GitHub's API changed the date format tonight. [Vincent Driessen]

  The dates returned are now all UTC formatted and include time zone
  information.  This patch can probably be reduced to even less code,
  but I wanted it to be "satefy first".

- Add support for Github's OAuth authentication URLs. [Vincent Driessen]

  When using OAuth instead of api_token authentication, these URL's
  don't POST username+api_token, but add a ?access_token= query
  parameter to the calls.

- PyFlakes. [Vincent Driessen]

- Added github.repos.pushable() as described in the API documentation.
  [Jens Ohlig]

- Include fractions of seconds in api delay. [Jeremy Dunck]

- Add project property to Repository, a bit more convenient in client
  code than owner+'/'+name. [Jeremy Dunck]

- Change to HTTPS. [Daniel Greenfeld]

- Add support for editing issues. [James Rowe]

- Add support for reopening issues. [James Rowe]

- Add support for searching issues. [James Rowe]

- Removed unused import. [James Rowe]

- Don't install the tests package. [James Rowe]

  Without this we get the tests package is installed as a top-level
  package.  May be easier to just specify the github2 package directly.

  api_token="2e66a5c7e24d1d066230f368ce8b094e")         >>> repos =
  github.repos.list("company")      `repos` now contains a list of
  public and private repositories of "company".
