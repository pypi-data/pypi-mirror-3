Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        ``Products.BeakerSessionDataManager`` is a replacement for the default Zope 2
        session implementation. (Compatible with Zope 2.10 and later.)  It uses
        `Beaker`_ as a backend (via `collective.beaker`_) and adapts the Beaker session
        to provide the same interface as a normal Zope session.
        
        Beaker is a better alternative to the default session implementation for several
        reasons:
        
        * The Zope session implementation does not perform well in high-write scenarios.
        * Beaker provides better flexibility in where session data is actually stored.
        * Beaker is used and maintained outside of the Zope ecosystem.
        
        .. Note::
        If you are developing a product that needs sessions but are not already
        using Zope sessions, you should probably just use collective.beaker
        directly. This product is meant for use with existing add-ons that already
        use Zope sessions (i.e. request.SESSION).

        .. _`collective.beaker`: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/collective.beaker
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        1. Add the Products.BeakerSessionDataManager egg to your buildout::
        
        [instance]
        eggs =
        Products.BeakerSessionDataManager
        
        2. Make sure that buildout adds Beaker configuration to zope.conf. For example::
        
        zope-conf-additional =
        <product-config beaker>
        session.type            file
        session.data_dir        ${buildout:directory}/var/sessions/data
        session.lock_dir        ${buildout:directory}/var/sessions/lock
        session.key             beaker.session
        session.secret          secret
        </product-config>
        
        The "secret" should be replaced with a unique string for your system. It
        must be the same for all Zope instances using the same session store.
        
        See the `collective.beaker`_ docs for more details on configuration.
        
        3. In the ZMI, delete the ``session_data_manager`` object and add a
        ``Beaker Session Data Manager``.
        
        Notes
        -----
        
        * Beaker does not automatically clean up old sessions, so you may want to set
        up a cron job to take care of this.
