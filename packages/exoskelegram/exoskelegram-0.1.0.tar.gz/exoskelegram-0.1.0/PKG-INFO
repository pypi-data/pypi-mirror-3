        ============
        
        exoskelegram is an X11 key press/release catcher/sender wrapper with
        abstractions. In a future release, in addition to being able to catch
        and send X key events from Python programs, exoskelegram will allow
        you to use simple config files to temporarily reprogram your entire
        keyboard --- or just a part of it.

        Installation
        ============
        
        Dependencies
        ------------
        
        exoskelegram requires the X11 headers and the Xtst extension. If you're using a
        package manager, remember to install the development packages (``*-dev`` or
        ``*-devel`` or something similar).
        
        Way #1
        ------
        Get the newest version of exoskelegram at
        http://metanohi.name/projects/exoskelegram/ or at
        http://pypi.python.org/pypi/exoskelegram
        
        Extract exoskelegram from the downloaded file, cd into it and run this in a
        terminal::
        
          # python3 setup.py install
        
        Examples are available in the ``examples`` directory.
        
        Way #2
        ------
        Just run this::
        
          # pip-3.1 install exoskelegram
        
        Note that this will not make any examples available.
        
        
        Use
        ===
        
        As a command-line tool
        ----------------------
        
        Run ``exoskelegram`` to use it. Run ``exoskelegram --help`` to see how to use it.
        
        As a module
        -----------
        
        To find out how to use it, run::
        
          $ pydoc3 exoskelegram.xkeylib
        
        
        Examples
        --------
        
        There are a few examples in the ``examples`` directory. None of them apply to
        the current few-features version.
        
        
        Development
        ===========
        
        exoskelegram uses Git for code management. The newest (and perhaps unstable)
        code is available at::
        
          $ git clone git://gitorious.org/exoskelegram/exoskelegram.git
