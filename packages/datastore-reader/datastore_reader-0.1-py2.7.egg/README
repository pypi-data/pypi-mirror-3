Datastore Reader
================

Datastore is a simple tool written to parse sugar metadata files from
backuped XO archives in a given folder.


Install
-------

To install the datastore_reader lib, you need python and easy_install tool.
Just in case, you can download the easy_install init script here::

    http://peak.telecommunity.com/dist/ez_setup.py


... and install it::

    $ python ez_setup.py


You should now be able to easy_install the datastore_reader as follow::

    $ easy_install datastore_reader


Run
---

The first datastore_reader entry point is called `moulinette`. It extract and
parse metadata from backups to csv files.

By default, archives should be in a sub-folder named `data` in the current
folder, ex::

    ./data
    ./data/archive-1.tar.bz2
    ./data/archive-2.tar.bz2
    ./data/archive-3.tar.bz2
    ...


All archives should have the .tar.bz2 extension. Here is the command to trigger
the first reader application::

    $ moulinette


At the end, you should find 2 new folders in the data floder::

    ./data/tmp
    ./data/out


In `tmp` sub-folder we have the extracted files from the parsing process.
All files are re-extracted each time and the tmp folder can be removed after.

In the `out` folder we find the .csv results of the moulinette script.
