===================================
Welcome to datapkg's documentation!
===================================

datapkg is a tool for distributing, discovering and installing data 'packages'.

datapkg is a *simple* way to 'package' data building on *existing* packaging
tools developed for code. datapkg is designed to integrate closely with the
`CKAN (Comprehensive Knowledge Archive Network) <http://www.ckan.net/>`_.

By putting data in a package, it gets labelled with standardized metadata and
can be put in a datapkg repository, such as CKAN or a local one. Once in such
a repository, the packages are easy to find and retrieve.
