Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        The `BLOB support in Plone`__ is amazing for a lot of reasons.
        
        __ http://pypi.python.org/pypi/plone.app.blob
        
        However, right now, Plone will raise errors when you visit a file content that use BLOB support,
        without having also the BLOB file.
        
        I don't know if this is good or not (I opened `an issue`__ related to this), but for developers this
        can be a little boring. It's quite common to copy a production ``Data.fs`` for developing something
        using production data, but you don't always want to copy all blobs.
        
        __ http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/11293
        
        This product will simply monkey-pach some points inside Plone, so visiting a ATFile/ATImage without its
        BLOB available will not show any errors to visitors.
