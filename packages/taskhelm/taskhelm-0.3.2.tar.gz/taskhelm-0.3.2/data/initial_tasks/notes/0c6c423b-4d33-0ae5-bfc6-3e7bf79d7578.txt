Welcome to TaskHelm!

You have a busy life full of many demands.  You need something more sophisticated than a plain text file for organizing your projects and their myriad steps.

TaskHelm seeks to help you sort through your piles of tasks.  It helps you organize them by project and priority, and to schedule them for future dates, so that you can narrow your focus to things that you want to focus on _right now_.


By reading this, you've already learned that your tasks are listed in the main Task List Browser, and that by doubleclicking on the task item you can read its text.

Once you've finished reading this task, click on the 'Mark as done' button at the top of this dialog to remove it from your todo list.  'Mark as done' registers the task as 'Completed', and it will show up on reports as an achieved task.  There is a 'Done' button on the main browser window which does the same thing.

Thank you for trying out TaskHelm!
