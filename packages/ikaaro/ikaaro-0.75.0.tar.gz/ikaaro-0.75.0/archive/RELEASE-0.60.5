ikaaro 0.60.5 (2009/10/29)
==========================

This is a Content Management System built on Python & itools, among
other features ikaaro provides:

 - content and document management (index&search, metadata, etc.)
 - multilingual user interfaces and content
 - high level modules: wiki, forum, tracker, etc.

A new view in the control panel, called "Search Engine Optimization",
allows to define the 'google-site-verification' tag.

Now it is possible to define the 'From' field of emails on per-site
basis, in the control panel; it is also possible to define the emails
signature.

The icms-update-catalog.py script has been optimized, and so have write
operations on the database.

Some bugs have been fixed, including #753.
