Description: ==================
        Mini Issue Tracker
        ==================
        
        Overview
        ========
        
        This issue tracker is a very very very small (albeit very efficient) issue
        tracker build on top of the automatic Django admin.
        
        .. note::
        
            Please note that I (Bruno Bord) am not the original author of this piece
            of software. I first saw this on Django Snippets: http://djangosnippets.org/snippets/28/
            It's the work of Paul Bissex - Many thanks to him.
        
            This snippet was designed for older versions of Django, and I just thought
            it deserved a fresh new start, using the latest Django features.
