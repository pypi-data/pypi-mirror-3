        Overview
        ========
        
        EventSocket is a wrapper around standard Python sockets that provides a simple callback API for handling reading, accepting, closures and errors. It is built specifically for TCP sockets, though it may be compatible with any socket family that uses ``send`` and ``recv`` (i.e. not UDP).
        
        Examples
        ========
        
        See the ``scripts`` directory for examples of how to use EventSocket. 
        
        http_client
          A client which runs simultaneous requests to an http server. Mimics behavior of ``siege``, though it only supports a few options.
        
        proxy
          A simple proxy which forwards data from localhost to another ``host:port``. Shows examples of setting up a server socket, handling an incoming connection and socket closures.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        To install using ``pip``,::
        
            $ pip install py-eventsocket
        
        If installing from source:
        
        * with development requirements (e.g. testing frameworks) ::
        
            pip install -r development.txt
        
        * without development requirements ::
        
            pip install -r requirements.txt
