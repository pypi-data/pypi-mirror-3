Overview
========

Takes the CalendarWidget shipped with Archetypes and Plone and displays the user
input section as a formlib widget. Use overrides.zcml to make this the default
widget. Correct functionality requires the CalendarWidget javascripts from core
Plone being accessible, as well as having ATContentTypes installed. No unit
tests yet, this is a proof of concept.
