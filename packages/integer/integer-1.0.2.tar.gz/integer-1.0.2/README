Package for creating integer types.

This package provides utilities for creating custom integer types.

Integer
-------

Inheriting directly from ``int`` type results in custom integer types where the results of operations are instances of int type. ::

    >>> class X(int): pass
    ...
    >>> a = X(1)
    >>> x = a + 1
    >>> x
    2
    >>> x.__class__
    <type 'int'>

``Integer`` can be used as a base class for custom integer types that preserve the type when performing operations. ::

    >>> from integer import Integer
    >>> class X(Integer): pass
    ...
    >>> a = X(1)
    >>> x = a + 1
    >>> x
    2
    >>> x.__class__
    <class '__main__.X'>

Subclasses can override the ``finalize_values`` method in order to affect the final return value of oeprations whenever the ``int`` operations returns an ``int``.

enum
----

``enum`` can be used to declare an enumeration, which defines the enumeration type and its enumeration values in the global scope of the calling module. ::

    >>> from integer.enum import enum
    >>> enum('RGB', RED=1, GREEN=2, BLUE=3, ALPHA=4)
    >>> RGB
    <class 'integer.enum.RGB'>
    >>> RED
    RED
    >>> int(RED)
    1
    >>> RGB(1)
    RED
    >>> RGB(1) is RED
    True
    >>> RED, GREEN, BLUE, ALPHA, RGB(5)
    (RED, GREEN, BLUE, ALPHA, RGB(5))

The type defined by ``enum`` does not restrict the values that it can represent, it just provides a helpful string representation for the named values.
