Web Services Made Easy
======================

Introduction
------------

Web Service Made Easy (WSME) is a very easy way to implement webservices
in your python web application. It is originally a rewrite of TGWebServices
with focus on extensibility, framework-independance and better type handling.

Main features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-   Very simple API.
-   Supports user defined simple and complex types.
-   Multi-protocol : REST+Json, REST+XML, SOAP, ExtDirect and more to come.
-   Extensible : easy to add more protocols or more base types.
-   Framework independance : adapters are provided to easily integrate
    your API in any web framework, for example a wsgi container,
    turbogears...
-   Very few runtime dependencies: webob, simplegeneric
    (+ Genshi if you use SOAP).
-   Integration in `Sphinx`_ for making clean documentation with
    wsme.sphinxext (work in progress).
