        Overview
        --------
        
        This package provides a configurable implementation of a Calendar Portlet.
        
        It is possible to give the calendar portlet a header, to search only for
        events with given keywords and constrain its results to only an area of your
        site.
        
        Even though Plone's default Calendar Portlet implementation is useful for most
        sites if you want to segment calendar's events or to provide more than one
        calendar per page, Extended Calendar Portlet comes to rescue.

        Installation
        ------------
        
        To enable this product,on a buildout based installation:
        
        - Edit your buildout.cfg and add ``collective.portlet.calendar`` to the list
          of eggs to install ::
        
            [buildout]
            ...
            eggs =
                 collective.portlet.calendar
        
        After updating the configuration you need to run the ''bin/buildout'', which
        will take care of updating your system.
        
        Go to the 'Site Setup' page in the Plone interface and click on the
        'Add/Remove Products' link.
        
        Choose the product (check its checkbox) and click the 'Install' button.
        
        Uninstall -- This can be done from the same management screen, but only
        if you installed it from the quick installer.
        
        Note: You may have to empty your browser cache and save your resource
        registries in order to see the effects of the product installation.
