.. Note::
    This file describes all the code that is necessary to run the chitwanabm.  
    You may also have files that end in .pyc. These files can be ignored - they 
    are automatically generated by Python when you run the model.

Initialization code:
===============================================================================

- `data_preprocess.R` - Used to produce initialization data for the model from 
  restricted access Chitwan Valley Family Study (CVFS) data.
- `initialize.py` - Produces the initial agents for the model from the output of 
  data_preprocess.R`.

Main model code:
===============================================================================

- `__init__.py` - Defines chitwanabm module (required for Python). Also loads 
  the default parameter values, using code from the pyabm toolkit.
- `agents.py` - Defines the agent classes used in the chitwanabm. Also defines 
  demographic events associated with those agents, and contains classes for 
  tracking land use within the model.
- `batch_run.bat` - Used to more conveniently run a set up ABM runs (of the 
  same scenario).
- `calc_NBH_stats.R` - Plotting code used after running the model to plot results 
  at the neighborhood level.
- `modelloop.py` - Contains the main model loop. This loop is called from the 
  code in `runmodel.py`, and defines the order in which events occur, and also 
  contains code to track model results for later plotting and analysis.
- `rcparams.default` - Contains the default parameter values for each parameter 
  in the model, for possible combinations of sub-models. Each model run does 
  not necessarily use each parameter listed in this file. The parameters used 
  in each model run are dependent on the chosen combination of sub-models.  The
  sub-models to use in a given scenario are chosen based on the values in this 
  file. For example, the value the 'model.parameterization.marriage' variable 
  is set to in this file determines whether the 'simple' or 'yabiku2006' 
  marriage timing parameterization will be used.
- `runmodel.py` - The main interface to the chitwanabm. This is the executable 
  file used to initiate a model run.
- `statistics.py` - Contains statistics functions that implement empirical 
  results for usage in the model.
- `test.py` - Contains validation functions to validate proper functioning of 
  the model code.

Plotting files (to process model run results)
===============================================================================

- `plot_LULC.R` - Plots the land-use and land-cover results at the neighborhood 
  level from a single model run.
- `plot_LULC_batch.R`- Plots aggregate statistics on land-use and land-cover 
  from a set of model runs of a single scenario.
- `plot_pop.R` - Plots population data at the neighborhood level (births, 
  marriages, deaths, migrations) from a single model run.
- `plot_pop_batch.R` - Plots aggregate statistics on population data at the 
  neighborhood level (births, marriages, deaths, migrations) from a set of 
  model runs of a single scenario.
- `plot_psns_data.R` - Plots individual-level statistics on population data 
  from a single model run.
