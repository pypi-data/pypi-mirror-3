1.0-beta3 (2011-01-10)
----------------------

- Recover from component lookup errors that result from trying to
  render HTML meta-tags for use as metadata.

- Disable search result filtering (at least until we can provide an
  interface that presents the normal 'we have filtered your results'
  dialogue).

- Ignore event handler if registry is unavailable (missing setup of
  ``plone.app.registry``).

- Fixed an issue where a ``checkPermission`` call would raise an
  exception because no interaction was established yet (for instance
  in a test setup).


1.0-beta2 (2010-12-20)
----------------------

- If an HTML meta-tag has no content attribute, drop it from the feed.


1.0-beta1 (2010-12-17)
----------------------

- Initial public release.
