Description: About
        -----
        
        Greins is a Gunicorn_ application which makes it easy to configure and
        manage any number of WSGI_ apps in one server daemon. It aims to simplify
        the process of setting up any number of system-wide Gunicorn_ daemons.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Greins requires a working version of Gunicorn_. It is recommended to read and
        understand the Gunicorn_ installation instructions before using Greins.
        
        Install from sources::
        
          $ python setup.py install
        
        Install as an rpm::
        
          $ make rpm
        
        Whatever was here before was wrong. There is no place in PyPI for Greins.
        The most useful aspects of Greins are in the packaging, since it aims to
        facilitate deployment of Gunicorn and adds no particular functionality itself.
        
        There's an init script in etc/init aims to be LSB-compliant and packaging
        for other distributions and systems is an ongoing effort.
        
        Those wishing to deploy Greins for their own infrastructure are encouraged
        to contribute to the development.
        
        Basic Usage
        -----------
        
        Greins installs one command line script invoked as ``greins``.

        Options are the same as for Gunicorn_ with one exception: the single
        APP_MODULE argument is replaced by APP_DIR, a directory containing python
        source files as described in the following section.
        
        Application Configuration
        +++++++++++++++++++++++++
        
        Applications should be configured by placing a python source file in the
        configuration directory. This file should populate a dictionary in the global
        scope called ``mounts`` which maps address prefixes (or 'mount points') to
        WSGI handler functions.
        
        These files are evaluated just like a Gunicorn_ `config file`_. Server hooks
        are valid in these configuration files and work as in Gunicorn_. Other options,
        such as logging and worker configuration, are ignored and should be configured
        globally for the Greins application.
        
        It should be possible to write an application for Gunicorn_ and then place
        the application's configuration inside the configuration directory for Greins
        to begin using it within Greins immediately.
