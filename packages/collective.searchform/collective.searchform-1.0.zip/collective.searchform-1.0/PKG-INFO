        Introduction
        ============
        
        An advanced searchform for Plone 4.2 and above.
        
        
        The searchform included in this package was in the core until version 4.1
        of Plone. It was removed in 4.2 in favour of a more cleaned and simplified
        search UI. This package is for all who want or need to retain the 
        old functionality.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Just add the egg `collective.searchform` to your buildout, rerun it and restart
        your instance.
        
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Add `search_form` to the URL of your Plone site and you will get a advanced
        search form which exposes most of Plones indexes in a search UI.
        
        Compatibility
        =============
        
        Plone 4.2 and 4.3
