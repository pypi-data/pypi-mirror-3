django-template-debug
=====================

A small collection of template tags for debugging and introspecting templates

Requirements
************
None, but the latest ipdb is highly recommended.

Installation
************

django-template-debug is available on pypi, so the easiest way to install it 
is using pip::

    pip install django-template-debug

Setup
*****
In your local settings.py (be sure the settings file is not used for a production environment)
add 'template_debug' to your installed apps via::

    INSTALLED_APPS.append('template_debug')

N.B. - You will need to change your INSTALLED_APPS setting to a list in your base settings.py if it is a tuple
or do something like: INSTALLED_APPS = list(INSTALLED_APPS) + 'template_debug'

Add DEBUG = TRUE to your local settings if it is not already set.
Unless DEBUG is set to TRUE, the debug templates will return without doing anything.
This behavior prevents your application from calling set_trace() or print in a production environment
if django-template-debug is accidentally installed outside of the local settings.


Examples
********

To use django-template-debug simply load the debug tags in a template as follows::

    {% load debug_tags %}

Be sure to put your tags inside of a section that you are certain will be rendered.
(e.g. make sure the tags are inside of a block tag that will be rendered and not inside of if tags)
Alternatively, you might insert a {% set_trace %} inside of a conditional or for loop to
determine if that branch is being executed in your template.

The available tags are outlined below:

{% set_trace %}
    - Starts a set_trace while the template is being rendered. ipdb is used if 
      available; otherwise the tag falls back to pdb.
    - The context is available inside of the set_trace as `context`.
    - Type 'availables' to see a list of variables inside of the context.
    - Most importantly, the variables available inside of the context are available in the local scope as <variable_name>
      (e.g. If a variables 'items' is in the context, it is available in the set trace as the variable 'items')

{% variables %}
    - Prints the variables available in the current context

{% details <variable_name> %}
    - Prints a dictionary in the pattern {attribute: value} of the variable 
      provided, for any attribute's value that can be obtained without raising 
      an exception or making a method call.

When using {% set_trace %}, one can use details and variables as functions as follows::

    details(variable_name)
    variables(context)

Type 'c' to continue rendering the template as normal
