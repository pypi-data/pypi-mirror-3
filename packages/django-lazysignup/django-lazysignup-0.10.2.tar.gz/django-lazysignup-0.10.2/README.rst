Introduction
============

``django-lazysignup`` is a package designed to allow users to interact with a
site as if they were authenticated users, but without signing up. At any time,
they can convert their temporary user account to a real user account.

``django-lazysignup`` is beta software. Bug reports, patches and extensions
are welcomed. While this package is in beta, backwards-compatibility will be
maintained for a single point release and a DeprecationWarning issued.

See the `full documentation`_ for more details.
