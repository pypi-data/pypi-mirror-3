Description: speedparser
        -----------
        
        Speedparser is a black-box reimplementation of the `Universal Feed
        Parser <http://www.feedparser.org/>`_.  It uses ``lxml`` for feed parsing and 
        for optional HTML cleaning.  Its compatibility with ``feedparser`` is very
        good for a strict subset of fields, but poor for fields outside that subset.  See
        ``tests/speedparsertests.py`` for more information on which fields are more or
        less compatible and which are not.
        
        On an Intel(R) Core(TM) i5 750, running only on one core, ``feedparser`` managed
        ``2.5 feeds/sec`` on the test feed set (roughly 4200 "feeds" in 
        ``tests/feeds.tar.bz2``), while ``speedparser`` manages around ``65 feeds/sec``
        with HTML cleaning on and ``200 feeds/sec`` with cleaning off.
