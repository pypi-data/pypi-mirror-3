Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        Provide the ``DexterityCompoundDiff`` diff type for `Products.CMFDiffTool`_, analogous to 
        ``ATCompoudDiff``.
        
        This is a package to help enable content versioning for Dexterity_ content types. To enable 
        versioning for a Dexterity content type you need to:
        
        1. Install `plone.app.versioningbehavior`_ and use it on your content type.
        2. Enable versioning for the type in the types control panel.
        3. Install this package.
        4. Go to the ``portal_diff`` tool ZMI page.
        5. Add ``Compound Diff for Dexterity types`` for your content type. ``Field name`` can be anything,
           e.g: "any".
        
        You can enable versioning on Dexterity content types without this package, but then you'll have
        to add the correct "diff type" for each field of your content type.
