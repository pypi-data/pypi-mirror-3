        If you develop with TiddlyWeb and are upgrading 1.0 to 1.2 there have
        been changes you should make yourself aware of. Read `UPGRADE1.0to1.2

        Introduction
        ------------
        
        TiddlyWeb, aka mo'ass, is a RESTful data store which forms the core of a
        reference implementation of server side implementation for TiddlyWiki.
        It tries to provide a tested, documented, and clear implementation of
        several facets that make up a good server-side:
        
        * transparent system and code suitable for porting to other
          languages (where use specific optimizations will hopefully occur)
        * an abstract model for authentication and authorization
        * an implementation of authenticated recipes and bags allowing
          the conrolled access to dynamically created collections of tiddlers
        * clean HTTP API based on REST principles
        * test driven description and development
        
        The system is designed so that parts that are not optimal for a
        particular installation can be easily improved or swapped out via
        plugins.
        
        While TiddlyWeb was designed as a TiddlyWiki server-side it can also be
        used as a generic data store that builds on concepts learned from
        TiddlyWiki, primarily the concept of the tiddler: a small chunk of data
        used to build up a greater whole.
        
        TiddlyWeb includes a command line tool called twanager. Run twanager
        without arguments for a list of available commands.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        The easiest way to install TiddlyWeb and all its dependencies is by
        using `pip <http://pip.openplans.org/>`_ to install it from `PyPI
        <http://pypi.python.org>`_:
        
           pip install -U tiddlyweb
        
        If you wish to use TiddlyWeb as a server-side for TiddlyWiki to generate
        a multi-user TiddlyWiki system, you will also need `tiddlywebwiki
        <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/tiddlywebwiki>`_. This too can be installed
        via pip. Installing tiddlywebwiki will install tiddlyweb for you:
        
           pip install -U tiddlywebwiki
        
        Or you can install by hand, you will need the following requirements:
        
        * Python 2.4, 2.5 or 2.6. (Python 3 has not yet been tested.)
        * selector: http://lukearno.com/projects/selector/
        * simplejson: http://undefined.org/python/#simplejson
        * html5lib (for sanitizing input which may be rendered as HTML):
          http://code.google.com/p/html5lib/
        
        Miscellaneous
        -------------
        
        See http://tiddlyweb.peermore.com/ for a TiddlyWiki generated by TiddlyWeb
        and TiddlyWebWiki, a TiddlyWeb plugin that provides TidldyWiki server-side
        functionality. That wiki contains the TiddlyWeb documentation. You can also
        leave comments there to help improve the documentation.
        
        See http://pypi.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=search&term=tiddlywebplugins
        for plugins that TiddlyWeb can use with itself.
        
        See http://tiddlyspace.com/ for a shared hosting service built on
        TiddlyWeb.
