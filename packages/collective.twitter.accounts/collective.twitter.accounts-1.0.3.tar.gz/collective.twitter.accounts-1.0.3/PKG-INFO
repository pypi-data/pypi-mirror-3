        Twitter Applications
        --------------------
        
        In order to allow external access to a twitter account, you need to register
        an "Application" in https://dev.twitter.com/ There's already a "PloneTweet"
        application registered that can be used, but if you want to use your own, just
        regiter it there.
        
        Actually posting or getting to/from Twitter
        -------------------------------------------
        
        This product just saves the needed data in order to post tweets or read them.
        You'll need additional products in order to do so, for example
