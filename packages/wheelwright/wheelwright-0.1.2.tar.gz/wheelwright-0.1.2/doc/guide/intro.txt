Introduction
============

Wheelwright is a Python PyQt4 package that visualizes the tension in a
bicycle wheel. It helps you build, repair, or maintain bicycle wheels
by showing the tension of each spoke in relation to the target tension
desired for the rim.

Prerequisites
-------------

To use Wheelwright, you need to have some tools and basic knowledge of
wheelbuilding.

Tools
^^^^^

* Tension meter
* Truing stand (recommended)

Currently only Park Tool's TM-1 tension meter is supported. Hopefully,
tension meters from other manufacturers will be added in future
releases.

A truing stand isn't required, but it will make things easier.

Skills
^^^^^^

The more you know about wheelbuilding the more you can get out of
Wheelwright.

* Measuring spokes
* Lacing a wheel
* Truing a wheel in both the lateral and radial directions
* Dishing a wheel

These topics are beyond the scope of this manual, but you will find
lots of information online. `Sheldon Brown and John Allen's
Wheelbuilding <http://sheldonbrown.com/wheelbuild.html>`_ guide is a
good place to start.
