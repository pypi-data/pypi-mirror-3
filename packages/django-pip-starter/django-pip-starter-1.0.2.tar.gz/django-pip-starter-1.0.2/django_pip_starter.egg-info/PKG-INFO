        Introduction
        ============
        
        Have you ever had problems deploying and configuring ``django`` project? This project
        removes headaches that you used to have when quick-starting ``django`` project, configuring
        environments, downloading packages and etc.
        
        It creates ``django`` project by using one simple command, ready for running.
        
        Solution is based on ``pip`` and ``virtualenv``, it has minimal external requirements.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        To install this package:
        
        ::
        
            pip install django-pip-starter
        
        If you already have django-pip-starter install you can use the following command to upgrade installation:
        
        ::
        
            pip install --upgrade django-pip-starter
        
        
        Quick start
        ===========
        
        The following commands creates empty, configured ``django`` project in virtual environment. Additionally it will
        install ``south`` package. For development environment it additionally installs ``django-debug-toolbar``, ``ipython``, ``ipdb``
        
        ::
        
            django-pip-starter.py project-name
            cd project-name
            make
            make run
        
        Where ``project-name`` is destination folder where starter should create files.
        
        ``make`` command will download and setup development virtualenv, download latest stable ``django`` version and create
        sqlite3 database, load initial data.
        
        ``make run`` will run development server. It's the same as running ``project/manage.py runserver`` which would also work.
        
        Default logins for django administration are user: ``admin`` pass: ``admin``

        History
        =======
        
        Idea for this project came from Mantas Zimickas (sirex, https://bitbucket.org/sirex/django-starter/overview).
        This was based on ``zc.buildout`` solution. After some time using ``django-starter`` we had problems deploying it
        and Petras Zdanavicius (petraszd) made a fork of ``django-starter`` that used only ``pip``. This was simple and elegant solution
        that Marius Grigaitis (marltu) expanded and packaged it into this project.
