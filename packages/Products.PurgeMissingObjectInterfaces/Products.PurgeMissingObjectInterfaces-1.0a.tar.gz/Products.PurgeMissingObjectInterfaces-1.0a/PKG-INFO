Description: Warning: This product is highly experimental, and created without deep
        knowledge/experience of the marker interfaces or ZODB machinery.  It
        may start making modifications deep within the ZODB and interface
        machinery as soon as it is loaded.
        
        It's main purpose is being installed and run on an instance that has
        old, broken marker interface dependencies and being used to find and
        clear those dependencies.  In particular this product was built to
        remove p4a (Plone 4 Artists) cruft when upgrading from Plone 3 to
        Plone 4.  It should be noted that product has its own uninstallation
        procedure.
        
        To use, create an external method find, and give it the parameter
        string which is a comma-separated list of package/class names to look
        for and remove.  In the case of Plone 4 Artists and its dependency
        dateable.chronos I used 'find?string=dateable,p4a'.
        
        Portions copied from ZODB and zope.interface (under the ZPL).  The
        rest is available under the GPL.
