How to use?
===========


You can import ``lesscss`` from ``js.lesscss`` and ``need`` it where you want
these resources to be included on a page::

  >>> from js.lesscss import lesscss
  >>> lesscss.need()

You need to use this resource with `bottom = true <http://fanstatic.org/configuration.html#bottom>`_ 
option because ``less.js`` script need to be loaded after all ``.less`` files.
