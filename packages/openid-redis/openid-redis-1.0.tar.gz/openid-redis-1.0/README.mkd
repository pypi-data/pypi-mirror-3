openid-redis
============

openid-redis is a Redis back-end storage for use with the python-openid
package made by JanRain. It implements the OpenIDStore interface and
can be plugged directly in.

To ensure proper operation, this back-end utilizes the entire
python-openid Store test suite and has 100% unit test coverage.

Requirements
------------
    
    python-openid: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-openid/
    Python redis library: http://github.com/andymccurdy/redis-py

Installation
------------

Install python-openid and the redis library, then install openid-redis.
    
    easy_install openid-redis

Usage
-----

When using python-openid, use the Redis store:
    
    from openidredis import RedisStore
    from openid.server import server
    
    openid_store = RedisStore()
    openid_server = server.Server(openid_store, 'base_url_here')

RedisStore takes several parameters, host, port, db, and a key_prefix to use for storing the keys.
    
    openid_store(RedisStore(host='localhost', port=4823, db=0, key_prefix='oid'))

Support
-------

openid-redis is a mature open-source project that is feature-complete. The
owner (Ben Bangert) does not actively use this package at the time, so any
bugs should be submitted on github via a Pull request and include tests that
prevent the test suite from dropping below the existing 100% test coverage.
