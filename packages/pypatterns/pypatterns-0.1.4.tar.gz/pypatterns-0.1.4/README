This package implements some common patterns in Python.

The implemented patterns are
* filters
* commands
* object relational mapping.  

The object relational mapping provides two benefits to developers.  First, it provides an interface to query relational tables using filters, as opposed to SQL statements.  Second, it makes use of Trellis' automatic event management, so that libraries which make use of it as their in-memory cache can have components (e.g. GUIs) that get updated automatically when the data changes.

It requires the following:
* Python 2.5
* PEAK Trellis
* currypy

Once installed (see INSTALL for instructions), your Python application can use pypatterns as follows.

First, setup your environment. The location of all packages need to be in Python's search path.  Then, import the module:
        import pypatterns

See src/test/Test* for examples of usage.
