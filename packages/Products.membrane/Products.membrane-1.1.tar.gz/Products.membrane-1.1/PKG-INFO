Description: 
        
        Overview
        --------
        
        membrane is a set of PluggableAuthService (PAS) plug-ins that allow
        for the user-related behaviour and data (authentication, properties,
        roles, groups, etc.) to be obtained from content within a Plone
        site.  It does not actually provide a full member implementation, it
        is intended to be a set of tools from which a full implementation
        can be constructed.  It is meant to be flexible and pluggable, and
        easy to adapt to different deployment scenarios. It is not meant to
        be configured through-the-web-only, but to be adapted by filesystem
        code.
        
        membrane tries to take a step backwards and re-think some of the
        Plone membership-handling. We have tried to make it as simple as
        possible, so that grasping and extending it is simple. Hopefully,
        simplicity should also make it easier to make sure it is secure.
        
        For information about the "why?" of membrane, and some policies for
        helping out, please see 'MANIFESTO.txt'.
        
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        - Plone 3.0+
        
        Please see docs/INSTALL.txt for installation instructions.
        
        
        ---------
        WARNING!!
        ---------
        
          Currently, a catalog is used to index the interfaces implemented by
          the objects in the portal.  However, interfaces are specified
          programmatically, either via Python code or ZCML.  Any time Zope is
          restarted, interfaces may have changed, and, if they have, the
          catalog will have become out of date.  Work is under way on a more
          robust interface lookup solution, but for now if you change the
          interfaces implemented on any membrane related type or object, you
          may need to explicitly reindex the 'object_implements' interface on
          the membrane_tool.
        
        
        Changelog for Products.membrane
        
            (name of developer listed in brackets)
        
        1.1 (2011-12-01)
        
            - Made the getUserAuthProvider method private for better security.
              Use ``portal_membership.getMemberInfo(user_id)`` when you need something
              similar in a skin script or template.
              Problem reported by Richard Mitchell, thanks!
