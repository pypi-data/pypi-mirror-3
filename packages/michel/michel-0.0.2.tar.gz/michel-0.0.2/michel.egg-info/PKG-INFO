Description: Michel is your friendly mate that helps you managing your todo list. It
        can push/pull flat text files to google tasks.
        
        Keeping it stupid simple
        ========================
        
        Michel has only two commands:
        
            michel pull
        which prints the default todo list on the standard output
        
            michel push <TODO.txt>
        which replaces the default todo list with the content of TODO.txt
        
        Non features
        ------------
        
        Michel aims at being simple: it does not handle due dates nor notes.
        
        Syntax
        ------
        
        One line is one task. Indented lines are subtasks of the "parent" line.
