        Overview
        ========
        
        The *p4a.calendar* package is a package for producing calendars from
        collection of events. Features include:
        
        Monthly, Weekly, Daily view
          Any calendar activated (smart) folder can has several default views
          including a monthly, weekly and daily view.
        
        Chronological event view
          The events gathered together by the activated calendar can be displayed
          using a chronological event listing.
        
        Past events view
          Events that have already occurred are grouped into a past events listing page.
        
        Color coding by event type
          Events can be color coded based on what event type (keyword) they have 
          been assigned.
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
          1. When you're reading this you have probably already run 
             ``easy_install p4a.calendar``. Find out how to install setuptools
             (and EasyInstall) here:
             http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall
        
          2. For installation into a Zope environment, create a file called 
             ``p4a.calendar-configure.zcml`` in the 
             ``/path/to/instance/etc/package-includes`` directory.  The file
             should only contain this::
        
                <include package="p4a.calendar" />
