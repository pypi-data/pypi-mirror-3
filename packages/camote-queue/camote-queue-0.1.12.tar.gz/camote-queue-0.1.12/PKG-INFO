Description: Camote Queue
        ============
        
        Camote Queue is a `Python <http://python.org/>`_ implementation of a `queue <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queue>`_ on top of `Redis <http://redis.io/>`_ that supports introspecting a job's position in the queue.
        
        Why another queue?
        ------------------
        
        I've tried a couple of existing queue implementation and none of them supports fetching the job's position in the queue, hence Camote Queue was born.
        
        What's with the name?
        ---------------------
        
        Camote Queue is a snack I used to buy when I was a kid, its basically slices of fried sweet patato (Camote) covered with melted sugar and stacked (like a queue) in a stick.
