Spell checker for code
======================
This is a Python library and tool to check for misspelled words in
source code. It does this by looking for words from a list of
common misspellings. The dictionary it uses to do this is based
on the Wikipedia list of common misspellings.

* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Lists_of_common_misspellings/For_machines

The list has been slightly modified to remove some changes that
cause a number of false positives. In particular ``ok->OK`` was
removed (ok is frequently used in perl tests for instance).

Example
=======
To try it out, merely run the following (using an old coreutils
source tree as an example)::

    $ git clone git://git.sv.gnu.org/coreutils -b v8.10 coreutils
    $ find coreutils -name '*.c' | misspellings -f -
    coreutils/src/cat.c:754: efficency -> "efficiency"
    coreutils/src/comm.c:198: funtion -> "function"
    coreutils/src/expr.c:21: seperate -> "separate"
    coreutils/src/pr.c:1417: accomodate -> "accommodate"
    coreutils/src/tac.c:342: unneccessary -> "unnecessary"
    coreutils/src/test.c:91: supressed -> "suppressed"

Contributions
=============
Contributions are welcome! Please add unit tests for new features
or bug fixes. To run all the unit tests run ``./setup.py test``.
If you have `tox`_ installed, just run ``tox``.

Note that tests are run on `Travis`_ for all supported python
versions whenever the tree on github is pushed to.

TODO
====
Some items on the TODO list:

* Implement option to interactively fix files.
* Give some thought to supporting multiple languages?
* Might a "common misspellings" list be different for different English
  users - might an American make one set of mistakes while a German
  writing English make another? Source of this data?
* Fix pip upgrade bug.
* Fix sed flag.
