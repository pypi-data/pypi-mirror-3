Description: 
        Description:
        
        dyndnsc is both a script to be used directly as well as a re-usable and
        hopefully extensible collection of classes for doing updates to dynamic
        dns services.
        
        Design:
        
        - updating a dyndns entry is done by a "DynDNS Update Protocol handler"
        - detecting IPs, both in DNS or elsewhere is done using IPDetector's
          which all have a detect() method and bookkeeping about changes
        - the DynDnsClient uses the Protocol Handler to do the updates and
          the IPDetectors to decide when an update needs to occur
        - a dummy endless loop ( used for time.sleep() ) repeatedly asks the
          DynDnsClient to make sure everything is fine
        
        Features:
        
        - relatively easy to embed in your own application (see main() for an example)
        - Growl desktop notification support (optional)
        
        Example use::
        
            python dyndnsc.py  --hostname test.dyndns.com --userid bob       --method=Iface,netmask:2001:0000::/32,iface:tun0,family:INET6
        
        Other:
        
        should work with python 2.3, tested with python 2.4, 2.5 and 2.6
