Changelog
=========

0.2
---

* New plugin: Added nose2.plugins.junitxml to support jUnit XML output.

* New hook: Added afterTestRun hook, moved result report output calls
  to that hook. This prevents plugin ordering issues with the
  stopTestRun hook (which still exists, and fires before
  afterTestRun).

* Bug: Fixed bug in loading of tests by name that caused ImportErrors
  to be silently ignored.

* Bug: Fixed missing __unittest flag in several modules. Thanks to
  Wouter Overmeire for the patch.
