Description: # CodeShow
        
        CodeShow turns a directory of code into a static website suitable for use in presentations. It uses [pygments](http://pygments.org) for syntax highlighting. In directories that include a `readme.md` or `readme.txt`, the readme contents will be displayed under the directory listing.
        
        Passing `--site44` generates content optimized for hosting on Site44:
        
        1. No .html or .txt file extensions are appended to files. This makes for prettier URLs.
        2. A `mimetypes.site44.txt` file is generated that enforces HTML and plain text content types for those pretty URLs.
        
        See [codeshow.site44.com](http://codeshow.site44.com) for an example of the output, or get the code at [github.com/smarx/codeshow](https://github.com/smarx/codeshow).
