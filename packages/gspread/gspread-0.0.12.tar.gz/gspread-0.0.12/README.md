# gspread

Python Google Spreadsheets library with simple API.

Features:

* Open a spreadsheet by its **title** or **url**.
* Extract range, entire row or column values.
* Independent of Google Data Python client library.
* Python 3 support.

## Basic usage

~~~python
import gspread

# Login with your Google account
gc = gspread.login('thedude@abid.es','password')

# Open a worksheet from spreadsheet with one shot
wks = gc.open("Where is the money Lebowski?").sheet1

wks.update_acell('B2', "it's down there somewhere, let me take another look.")
~~~

## More examples

### Opening a spreadsheet

~~~python
# You can open a spreadsheet by its title as it appers in Google Docs
sh = gc.open("My poor gym results") # <-- Look ma, no keys!

# If you want to be specific, use a key (which can be extracted from
# the spreadsheet's url
sht1 = gc.open_by_key('0BmgG6nO_6dprdS1MN3d3MkdPa142WFRrdnRRUWl1UFE')

# Or, if you feel really lazy to extract that key, paste the entire url
sht2 = gc.open_by_url('https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Bm...FE&hl')
~~~

### Selecting a worksheet

~~~python
# Select worksheet by index. Worksheet indexes start from zero
worksheet = sh.get_worksheet(0)

# Most common case: Sheet1
worksheet = sh.sheet1
~~~

### Getting a cell value

~~~python
# With label
val = worksheet.acell('B1').value

# With coords
val = worksheet.cell(1, 2).value

# Get all values from column. Column and row indexes start from one
first_col = worksheet.col_values(1)
~~~

### Updating

~~~python
worksheet.update_acell('B1', 'Bingo!')

# Or
worksheet.update_cell(1, 2, 'Bingo!')

# Select a range
cell_list = worksheet.range('A1:A7')

for cell in cell_list:
    cell.value = 'O_o'

# Update in batch
worksheet.update_cells(cell_list)
