Description: 
        execnet: rapid multi-Python deployment
        ========================================================
        
        .. _execnet: http://codespeak.net/execnet
        
        execnet_ provides carefully tested means to ad-hoc interact with Python
        interpreters across version, platform and network barriers.  It provides
        a minimal and fast API targetting the following uses:
        
        * distribute tasks to local or remote CPUs
        * write and deploy hybrid multi-process applications
        * write scripts to administer a bunch of exec environments
        
        Features
        ------------------
        
        * zero-install bootstrapping: no remote installation required!
        
        * flexible communication: send/receive as well as
          callback/queue mechanisms supported
        
        * simple serialization of python builtin types (no pickling)
        
        * grouped creation and robust termination of processes
        
        * well tested between CPython 2.4-3.2, Jython 2.5.1 and PyPy 1.1
          interpreters.
        
        * fully interoperable between Windows and Unix-ish systems.
