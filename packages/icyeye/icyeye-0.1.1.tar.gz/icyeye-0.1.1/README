The Inline CSS Images package (icyeye) provides functionality for transforming
url(...) declarations in CSS files which refer to images on disk into an inline
base64 encoded representation of that file.

The purpose of this project is to cut down on HTTP overhead when many small
images files are referenced by the CSS.
