Description: Overview
        ========
        
        This is a rendering server that will wrap an OpenOffice/LibreOffice server and provide
        a pythonic API which is remotely callable.
        
        The main advantage is that your client code does not need to import pyuno... This
        is a main plus because pyuno is a pain to get working on Windows and some flavors of
        Linux, don't even think of Mac :)
        
        Once you deploy a py3o.renderserver all you need in your python code is to use the
        py3o.renderclient which is really straightforward...
        
        Here is how we start the server on a Linux host::
        
          start-py3o-renderserver --java=/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk/jre/lib/amd64/server/libjvm.so --ure=/usr/lib64 --office=/usr/lib64/libreoffice --office-release=3.3 --driver=juno --sofficeport=8997
        
        As you can see it works with OpenJDK, LibreOffice and even on 64bit systems :)
