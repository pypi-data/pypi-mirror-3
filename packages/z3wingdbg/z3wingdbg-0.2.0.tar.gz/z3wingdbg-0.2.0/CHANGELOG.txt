z3wingdbg Changes
-----------------

This file contains change information for the current z3wingdbg release. For
information on what's still to implement, see TODO.txt.

z3wingdbg 0.2.0
---------------

:Date: 2006-09-01

:New features:

 - IDE-initialized debugger attaching

:Changes:

 - Switched to using zope.app.generations for installing persistent
   configuration
 - Changed auto-start to only work when debug-mode is active and no attachment
   port is open; due to the security risks of a running debug server 
   (especially one that accepts outside connections), the server should not
   automatically start in a production environment.

:Bug fixes:

 - Removed import of never-used randomstring utility interface; a stale .pyc
   file masked this oversight.
   
:Known issues:

 - Still no configuration UI, and the edit forms in the site management 
   interface do not check invariants.

z3wingdbg 0.1.0
---------------

:Date: 2006-08-13

:New features:

 - Componentized Wing debugger
 - HTTP debug server
 - Auto-start and auto-connect
 
:Known issues:

 - No configuration UI; configuration through edit forms on the configuration
   objects in /++etc++site/default/WingConfiguration and 
   /++etc++site/default/WingConfiguration/@@contents.html instead.
 - No connection accepting yet, only server-initialized connections are 
   supported
