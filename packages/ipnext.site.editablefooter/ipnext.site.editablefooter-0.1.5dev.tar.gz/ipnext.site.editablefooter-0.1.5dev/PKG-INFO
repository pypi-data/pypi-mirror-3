Description: IPnext - Editable Footer, for Plone 4
        =====================================
        
        
        Introduction
        ============
        
        This product replaces Plone's standard footer with one that is editable in the
        Plone Control Panel, through a WYSIWYG text box, by the Site Administrator.
        
        This product is for use cases where you want to give Site Admins the
        possibility of easily editing the footer without installing products which
        increase the complexity of the user interface, like ContentWellPortlets.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        See docs/INSTALL.txt
        
        
        Usage
        =====

        EditableFooter product, and clicking on 'Activate.
        
        Go back to the Plone Control Panel/ Site setup screen and a new entry should be
        present in the Add on Configuration section, called 'Footer settings'.
        
        
        Overview

        A new footer viewlet replaces the old, static one. The formatted text is stored
