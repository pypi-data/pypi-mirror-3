Known issues
------------

  - Creating an adapter in update mode with no mapped fields (e.g, 
    for adding new objects related to some existing object) will always result in
    the "Session expired" message, and the session will not include the id of the
    found object.  To avoid this, we need to find a way to prime the object id in
    the session even if @@sf_value is not called.
 
  - Mapping a field in two different update adapters means that the
    second one won't be found when prepopulating.

  - Can't have multiple tabs accessing the same form with different
    SF objects. (not sure how to distinguish this in the session key...)

Future ideas
------------

- change default sObjectType to Lead
- An error should be thrown if Salesforce PFG Adapter product is installed and no Salesforce Base Connector
  object has been added to the site.
- fix i18n support for DataGridField column names, and implement the translation
- Take our type out of the types menu in Plone 3.0 (Awaiting fix to: https://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7370)
- Handle here or at other levels in the stack: 
   SoapFaultError: 'UNKNOWN_EXCEPTION' 'UNKNOWN_EXCEPTION: 
   Server unavailable due to scheduled maintenance'
