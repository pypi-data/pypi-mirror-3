To Do Items Index
=================

General To Do Items
-------------------

- Change @coroutine so that only Python coroutines that use it are considered
  ICoroutine and not all Python coroutines.
- Add required keyword arguments for exceptions and tests to check for them.
- Remove extra keyword argument support from messages and components.
- Add specialized Components that match filter_from_callable(),
  producer_from_iterable() and sink_from_callable().
- Make IPostOffice and IScheduler directly accept containers without needing
  to pass in only .coroutines or .links.
- Change IContainer to IGrouping and containers to groupings.  They don't
  actually *contain* anyting.  They just group coroutines together.
- Create explicit Link and Message objects, interfaces, and adaptation to
  tuples.
- Create a general "provides or adapts to" interface function in utils and use
  is.
- See about spliting scheduling and message delivery out into seperate classes.
- Remove the api modules and just import the APIs in the pacakge __init__.py
  files.
- M4USException should also have a __unicode__ mehtod and __str__ should encode
  the exception message into bytes.
- Add convenience components that dispatch to a single method for each message,
  a different method per message type and a different method per inbox.
- Move the IScheduler.run(cycles) parameter to ISheduler.cycle(cycles=1).  This
  is more consistent to each method having a single purpose.
- Test the project under Python 2.7.
- Make the project work under Python 3.1.
- Expand documentation.
- Add doctests as working examples to all docstrings.
- Remove superfluous "See Also", and make object references short (i.e. use ~)
- See about running cheesecake and making it happy.
- Set up a mailing list for feedback. (librelist.org?, not Google groups)
- Setup Hudson somewhere for continuous integration.
- Refactor all code as per the book Beautiful Code.
- Add logging support to all existing objects.
- Add a logging/provenance coroutine that goes in front of other coroutines and
  sends logging messages out on a different mailbox.
- Add a multi-process coroutine adapter like ThreadedCoroutine.
- Add file processing coroutines.
- Add an external interface to manually send messages into a running system as
  if one were just calling a function/method.
- Add an adapter so that  Kamaelia components can be used directly.
- Add a AMQP coroutine adapter.
- Add a 0MQ coroutine adapter.
- Add an eventlet-bases scheduler.
- Add a Twisted-baded scheduler.
- See about VisTrails integration.
- Add network stream processing coroutines
- Add support for network services including HTTP, etc.
- Add support for running WSGI apps.
- Add more Kamaelia-inspired constructs.
- Split out the Paver tasks into a seperate generic package.
- Split out the test infrastructure into a seperate generic package.
- Maybe split out the completely generic utility code into it's own seperate
- package.  (memoize, Pep8itfying code, etc.)
- Submit dependency fixes, workarounds and enhancements to upstream projects to
  help improve them. (Paver virtualenv, Unittest2 assert_not_raises, & pep8ify,
  etc.)
