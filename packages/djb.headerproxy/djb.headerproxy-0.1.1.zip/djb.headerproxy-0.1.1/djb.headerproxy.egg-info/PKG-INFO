        Introduction
        ============
        
        Simple package that extends the proxy object within ``Paste`` to allow
        the WSGI proxy to read its connection location from arbitrary headers.
        It will keep all other headers (including ``Host:`` intact during transit);
        you may or may not need to adjust what you're doing upstream accordingly.
        
        Configuration
        -------------
        
        By default, the proxy will read the host to connect to from the
        ``X-Proxy-Force-Host`` header and read the connection scheme from
        ``X-Proxy-Force-Scheme``.  
        
        You can override these using relevant configuration
        like follows. Keep in mind that at time of proxy, we're reading headers from
        the ``environ`` dictionary, so specify your headers in this manner.  For 
        instance, ``X-Proxy-Foobar`` will become visible in the ``environ`` dict
        as ``HTTP_PROXY_FOOBAR`` (noting dashes to underscores, and replacement
        of ``X`` with ``HTTP``).  You can make this mapping happen thusly::
        
            [app:proxy]
            use = egg:djb.headerproxy
            force_host = HTTP_PROXY_FORCE_HOST
            force_scheme = HTTP_PROXY_FORCE_SCHEME
        
        The above example is overly verbose, however, as we already default to 
        using these specific headers. This does demonstrate how you can customise
        this behaviour to suit you -- for instance, if your front-end automatically
        provides some headers, you can configure the mapping accordingly.
        
        Warning
        -------
        
        If unprotected, this WSGI middleware could be used as an open proxy since
        headers can easily be spoofed. You should take steps to either firewall off
        your application, drop headers at an upstream web server, run this as a
        local socket, or do something similar (or all of the above!).
        
        You've been warned.
