============
gocept.month
============

A datatype which stores a year and a month.

This package provides the data type ``Month`` (typical usage:
``Month(4, 2003)``), which supports conversion to and from strings, as well as
a zope.schema field and widgets for both zope.formlib and z3c.form.

To use the month field, ``<include package="gocept.month"/>`` and declare a
schema like this:

    >>> import gocept.month
    >>> import zope.interface
    >>> import zope.schema
    >>> class IContract(zope.interface.Interface):
    ...     title = zope.schema.TextLine(title=u"Contract title")
    ...     start = gocept.month.MonthField(title=u"Starting date")
    ...     end = gocept.month.MonthField(title=u"Ending date")
