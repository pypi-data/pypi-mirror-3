Templates

Required Templates and Fragments
--------------------------------

No templates are strictly required for this theme beyond the base :ref:`template fragments` that all Engineer sites
will likely want to provide. In particular, users of the Ole B theme will probably want to create
:file:`_sidebar.html` and :file:`_primary_nav.html` templates.
