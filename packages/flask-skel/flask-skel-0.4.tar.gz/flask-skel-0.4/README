Flask-Skel
----------

Flask-Skel is a simple Paster template to help you get started with a minimum Flask+Mongoengine application. You can (and probably will) modify all of this in the course of your projects.

It was inspired by Flask-kickstart by danjac

Getting started
---------------

1. Download and install this package.

2. To create your project directory, run::

    paster create -t flask-skel myproject

3. A new dir, "myproject", will now be created.

4. Make a virtualenv for "myproject"::

    virtualenv --no-site-packages myproject

5. cd into myproject and run::

    source bin/activate
    
    pip install -r requirements.txt


6. Have fun !
