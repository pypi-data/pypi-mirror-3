        Sonar Quality Analysis Rules Extractor
        ======================================
        
        What is the Sonar Rules Extractor?
        ==================================
        
        The extractor is a tool that extracts the violation rules from analysis tools like Cppcheck,
        C++Test, Klocwork, etc. and converts them into Sonar rules.
        
        Why converting those rules into Sonar rules?
        ============================================
        
        When we are doing a conformity analysis of coding rules, the output of this analysis gives us
        a link between the line of the source file where the rule has been violated and the ``ID`` of
        this violated rule. An association between a rule ``ID`` and its description has to be given to
        Sonar.
        
        To take into account all the custom rules developed in the quality analysis tools, it is
        necessary to have a utility which exports those tools' rules. **The Sonar Rules Extractor is there 
        for that.**
        
        .. note:: Sonar has by default five kinds of rule severity: ``Blocker``, ``Critical``, ``Major``,
           ``Minor``, ``Info``. But it is not the case for all the analysis tools. For example, in Klocwork,
           the severities are represented by numbers : 1 (Critical) to 10 (Info).
        
           The *Sonar Rules Extractor* will have a mapping of those levels so they mean something to Sonar.
        
        How to install it?
        ==================
        
        If you have Python **setuptools** already installed and have a direct internet connection, you just need
        to run the following command: ::
        
           root@localhost:~# easy_install -O2 sonar-rules-extractor
        
        If Python **setuptools** is not installed, please install it first.
        
        If you don't have a direct connection to the internet, download a package suitable to your distribution
        and install it. ::
        
           root@localhost:~# tar zxvf sonar-rules-extractor*.tar.gz
           ...
           root@localhost:~# cd sonar-rules-extractor*
           root@localhost:~# python setup.py install -O2
           ...
           root@localhost:~#
        
        For windows users who don't want to run the command line installer, there is a native ``.exe`` package.
        
        How to extract rules from code analysis tools?
        ==============================================
        
        The **Sonar Rules Extractor** comes with a command line tool ``sonar-rules-extractor``. You can run it
        with the ``--help`` option to get info. ::
        
           root@localhost:~# sonar-rules-extractor --help
           Usage: sonar-rules-extractor [options] tool <input args...>
        
              <input args...> depend on the tool. Generally, if no args are provided,
              standard input is read.
        
           Options:
              --version             show program's version number and exit
              -h, --help            show this help message and exit
              -p MODULE, --plugin=MODULE
                                    Before extraction, import the specified module and
                                    look for classes that inherit "Extractor" which can be
                                    used in addtion to the built-in ones. This option can
                                    be used multiple times.
              -f, --format-xml      Pretty format XML output.
              -l, --list-tools      List all available tools.
        
        You can get the list of available supported tools with this command: ::
        
           root@localhost:~# sonar-rules-extractor --list-tools 
           pylint, klocwork, cpptest, gnatcheck, qac, qacpp, cppcheck, logiscope
        
        Here is an example extraction for PyLint: ::
        
           root@localhost:~# pylint --list-msgs | sonar-rules-extractor pylint --format-xml > pylint-sonar-rules.xml
           root@localhost:~# cat pylint-sonar-rules.xml
           <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
           <!--EXTRACTED "pylint" RULES FOR SONAR-->
