A testing fixture for the txlongpoll service (see
https://launchpad.net/txlongpoll).


Building
--------

 $ make build


Testing
-------

 $ make check


Running
-------

Make sure that the buildout-generated bin/ directory containing the
twistd-for-txlongpoll executable is in the PATH, or specify an
absolute path with twistd_bin, otherwise the fixture won't find it.

Example usage:

 >>> class MyTest(testtools.TestCase):
 ...     def test_thingy(self):
 ...         fixture = TxLongPollFixture(
 ...             frontend_port=9999, broker_user="guest",
 ...             broker_password="guest", broker_vhost="/",
 ...             broker_host="localhost", broker_port=5672,
 ...             twistd_bin="twistd-for-txlongpoll")
 ...         self.useFixture(fixture)
