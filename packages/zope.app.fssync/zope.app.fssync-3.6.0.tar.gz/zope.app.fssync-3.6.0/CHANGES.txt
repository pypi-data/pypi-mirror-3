- The ssh transport now looks for known_hosts in an application specific file,
  as well as the normal known_hosts file and in the user's Agent.  This file is
  ~/.ssh/fssync_known_hosts if POSIX and ~/ssh/fssync_known_hosts if win32.

- BUGFIX: The ssh transport now will prompt the user if he wishes to use an
  unrecognized hostkey.  If he says 'yes', it will be added to the fssync
  known_hosts file.  if he says 'no', an exception is raised.

- BUGFIX: If the user's public key is encrypted, fssync will prompt for a
  password.

  by default.

* Added 'resolved' as an alias for the 'resolve' command.

* Added a 'merge' command. It allows merging changes from one checkout
  to another.

  urls to communicate with the server.
