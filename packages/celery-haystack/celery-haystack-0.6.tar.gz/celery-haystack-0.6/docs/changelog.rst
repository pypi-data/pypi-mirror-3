Changelog
=========

v0.6 (2012-06-27)
-----------------

* *backwards incompatible change* Added support for
  `django-celery-transactions`_ to make sure the tasks are respecting
  Django's transaction management. It holds on to Celery tasks
  until the current database transaction is committed, avoiding potential
  race conditions as described in `Celery's user guide`_.

  This is **enabled by default** but can be disabled in case you want
  to manually manage the tranasctions:

      CELERY_HAYSTACK_TRANSACTION_SAFE = False

* Refactored the error handling to always return a message about what
  happened in every step of the index interaction. Raise exception about
  misconfiguration and wrong parameters quicker.

* Improved support for multiple search indexes as implemented by
  Haystack 2.X. Many thanks to Germ√°n M. Bravo (Kronuz).
