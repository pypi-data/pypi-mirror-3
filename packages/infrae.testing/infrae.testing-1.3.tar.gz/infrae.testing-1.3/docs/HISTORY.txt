Changes
=======

1.3 (2012-09-03)
----------------

- ``suite_from_package`` is now more generic. Other test file types can
  be plugged in to this discovery function.

- Add two different sets of callback for cleanup: one after each test,
  one after each layer. This add more possibilities than the default
  set of callbacks provided by zope.testing.

- Refactor Zope events helpers, and test methods, to be more generic.

- Add a class with all the test methods defined in a testcase. This
  makes possible to use the test methods with having a testcase.

1.2 (2011-11-07)
----------------

- Update for Python 2.7 and Zope 2 2.13.

1.1 (2010-10-07)
----------------

- Add two context managers: assertTriggersEvents and
  assertNotTriggersEvents for event testing.

- In Zope2 request container, default hostname is `localhost`, not
  `foo`.

- Fix the option ``SETUP_CACHE`` when reloading databases (didn't work
  because of the Zope2 Session container setup code).


1.0 (2010-07-14)
----------------

- Initial release.
