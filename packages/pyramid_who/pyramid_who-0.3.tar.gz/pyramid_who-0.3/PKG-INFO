        ``pyramid_who`` Changelog
        =========================
        
        0.3 (2011-11-07)
        ----------------
        
        - Add tox.ini for Jenkins testing.
        
        - Added a "challenge decider" function for use by ``repoze.who`` with
          current versions of ``pyramid``, which now return "403 Forbidden" instead
          of "401 Unauthorized" on authorization failures.
        
        
        0.2 (2011-03-23)
        ----------------
        
        - Pass the identifier plugin to ``api.remember``, rather than its name,
          as required by the interface.  Fixes
          https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_who/issues#issue/2
        
        - Fixed test of ``unauthenticated_userid``.
        
        - Fixed tests broken by ``repoze.who`` changes (relaxing exceptions to
          warnings for missing / invalid config rile).
        
        - Fixed URL to docs in README.txt.  Thanks to ≈Åukasz Fidosz.
