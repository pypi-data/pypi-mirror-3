Press Room TODO
===============

Note: the main repository for todo items is the Issue Tracker (http://plone.org/products/pressroom/issues).
The Roadmap (http://plone.org/products/pressroom/roadmap) also contains proposals for some enhancements under debate. 

Plone 4 compatibility:
----------------------

- upgrade step(s)


Other Ideas:
------------

- Come up with some good content icons for PressClip & PressRelease
- Documentation for how to administer Press Items (everything else is still too undefined)
- Look into possibly more suitable widgets for the reuse of publication sources
- Is there a reason that the 'browse contacts' form can't just show all the contacts on the site automatically?
- News Item - Disable this on installation? Still not sure.  My gut says no, but when you potentially have an option
    to add a Press Release, Press Clip, News Item (and possibly a Blog Entry), will careless users get confused
- Subheadline - fields should be longer, like description-length, never underestimate the ability for long headlines
 and subheadlines in press releases :)
