Ultimate goals for yaposib:
==========================
- Being available precompiled on every platforms OSI is available on
- Having a consequent test suite
- Support every solvers

Work planned
============
- No work on the API is planned (but feature requests will be studied).
  The prefered method to use yaposib should be through pulp-or, so API
  modifications should come from them.
- Addition of unit tests.

Related work
============
The real work on yaposib should instead be done on OSI: In the end,
yaposib should come with a precompiled OSI that supports every solvers.
This is not currently possible, but it should become so. Patches for
gurobi have already been submitted, and more patches should come.
