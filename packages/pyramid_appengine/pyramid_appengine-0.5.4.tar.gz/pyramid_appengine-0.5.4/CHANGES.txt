0.5.4
-----------------

upgrading buildout to appengine sdk 1.6.5 and pyramid 1.3

changed application template to not use an ini file because it doesn't
really add any value on appengine, but handling the paste*
dependencies is troublesome for the recipe rod.recipe.appengine under
some circumstances.

This is just the default behavior of course, there's nothing stopping
you from deploying with an ini file if you wish.


0.5.3: 03-27-2012
-----------------

upgrading buildout to appengine sdk 1.6.4, the first SDK which works
with python2.7.

-----------------
