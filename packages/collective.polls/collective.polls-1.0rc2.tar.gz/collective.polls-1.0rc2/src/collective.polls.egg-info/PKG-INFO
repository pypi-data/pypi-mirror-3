        Overview
        --------
        
        A content type, workflow, and portlet for conducting online polls, for
        anonymous and logged-in users.
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        * Plone >= 4.1.x (http://plone.org/products/plone)
        * Dexterity >= 1.1 (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/plone.app.dexterity)
        
        Features
        --------
        
        * Polls can be open for anonymous users to vote
        * Voting can take place in the object or in a voting portlet
        * The voting portlet shows automatically the latest open poll or a specific
          open poll
        * Users can see partial results of the poll
        * Results can be shown using a bar chart, a pie chart, or just by number of
          votes
        
        Workflow description
        --------------------
        
        The workflow associated with polls has the following states: Private, Pending
        review, Open and Closed.
        
        * Polls are created in Private state; only Owner, Manager, Editor or Site
          Administrator roles can modify them
        * When a poll is Private it can be sent to Pending review or directly to Open,
          if the user has the proper role (Reviewer, Manager, Site Administrator)
        * When a poll is Pending review it can be edited by Manager, Editor, Reviewer 
          or Site Administrator roles
        * A poll in Pending review can be sent to Open, with "Review portal content"
          permission, or to Private, with "Request review" permission
        * When the poll is Open, people can only vote; nobody can modify the poll in
          any way
        * An Open poll can be sent to Private or Closed state by Reviewer, Manager or
          Site Administrator roles
        * When a poll is Closed nobody can modify it, nor can anyone vote on it; there
          is no way to reopen a closed poll
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        To enable this product in a buildout-based installation:
        
        1. Edit your buildout.cfg and add ``collective.polls``
           to the list of eggs to install ::
        
            [buildout]
            ...
            eggs =
                collective.polls
        
        2. You may need to extend a Dexterity known good set (KGS) to make sure that
           you get the right versions of the packages that make up Dexterity ::
        
            [buildout]
            ...
            extends =
                http://good-py.appspot.com/release/dexterity/1.1?plone=4.1
        
        After updating the configuration you need to run ''bin/buildout'',
        which will take care of updating your system.
        
        Go to the 'Site Setup' page in a Plone site and click on the
        'Add-ons' link.
        
        Check the box next to ''collective.polls'' and click the 'Activate' button.
        
        Note: You may have to empty your browser cache and save your resource
        registries in order to see the effects of the product installation.
