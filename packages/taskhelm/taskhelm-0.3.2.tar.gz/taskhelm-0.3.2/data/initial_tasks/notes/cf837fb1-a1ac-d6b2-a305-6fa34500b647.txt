Taskhelm can be configured by creating a ~/.taskhelmrc file.

Here's mine, for an example:

# .taskhelmrc
notes.location   = /srv/Shared/Tasks/notes

projects         = work, work.arsenal, work.launchpad, work.xdiagnose, work.xorg, health, family, house, house.yard, house.shop, office, office.finance, computer.hardware, computer.network, devel.projector-room, devel.taskhelm

waits.hours      = 1,4,8,16
waits.days       = 1,2,3,4,5,6
waits.weeks      = 1,2,3,4
waits.months     = 2,3,6
waits.years      = 1

show_menu_bar    = no
show_tool_bar    = yes
show_status_bar  = yes
show_left_pane   = no
show_detail_pane = no


The default notes.location is ~/.task/notes, however I keep my notes on an NFS share so I can access them from all the computers in my house.  To do this, I also configure taskwarrior to use the NFS share:

# .taskrc
data.location=/srv/Shared/Tasks/
