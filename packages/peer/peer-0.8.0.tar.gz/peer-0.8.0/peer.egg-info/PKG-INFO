        PEER
        ====
        
        Public Endpoint Entities Registry
        
        PEER is envisioned as a lightweight, global registrar for SAML Metadata
        representing both SAML and non-SAML endpoints (e.g., OpenID, IMI). It is
        intended as a focused activity to catalyze international use of federated
        identity. The service is not intended to be a replacement for federation
        or inter-federation, but is intended to be a tool supporting such activities.

        CHANGES
        =======
        
        0.8.0 (2012-01-31)
        ------------------
        - Rich metadata support. Now it is possible to edit the logo and
          geolocalization hint of an entity. This feature is used
          to display richer multimedia information through PEER.
        - Improve the metadata editor with request initiator and
          discovery response endpoint support. Also improve the localization
          plugin and add keywords and logo to the information plugin.
        - Metadata refresh: if the entity id is a URL that points to the
          metadata itself the user can activate a periodic fetch of this
          metadata.
        - Preview before commit: now the editing and commiting flows are
          separated by a modal dialog that ask for the commit message only
          when the changes are ready. In this dialog a diff of the current
          changes is available for easy reviewing.
        - Git repositry co-existence: if there is already a Git repository
          with metadata files it can be reused in PEER by specifing the
          directory that PEER 'owns' inside this repository.
        - Metadata grouping: a user can define an entity group by writing
          a query. A custom feed and map for this group are created
          automatically so following the changes for related entities
          becomes easier.
        - Lots of bug fixes and documentation improvements.
        
        0.7.0 (2011-12-22)
        ------------------
        - DNS-based domain validation
        - Delegated domains: an administrator can validate a domain directly and
          create a team that can manage such domains as if they were the owners.
        - Administration team: an administrator can add (and remove) other users
          to the administrators team giving them full powers in the system.
        - Support for EntityAttributes SAML extension via a SAMLmetaJS new plugin.
        
        0.6.0 (2011-11-30)

          which metadata attributes can be edited and which ones can't be changed.

          unsaved changes before he navigates to another page.
        - Remove the metadata when removing the entity.
