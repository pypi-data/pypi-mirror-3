title: About Volt

This is an example of a simple page processed by **Plain Engine**. Not that
different apparently, from the blog pages. But this is a whole different
section of the site. The URL is different, and the processing logic is
slightly different.

Take a look at the [source code](http://github.com/bow/volt/blob/master/volt/engine) 
to see the similarities and differences of the Blog engine and Plain engine. 
Try turning the plain engine off by removing its entry in **voltconf.py** and see
what happens to this page. Try messing with the URL, try changing the permalink, try
all the things :D!
