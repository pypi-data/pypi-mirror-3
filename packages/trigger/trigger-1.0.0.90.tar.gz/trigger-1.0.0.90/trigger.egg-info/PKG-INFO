Description: 
        Trigger is a framework for communicating with network devices that was written
        by the Network Security team at AOL to enhance management of security policies
        on network devices. It was written in Python utilizing the freely available
        Twisted Matrix event-driven networking engine. The libraries can connect to
        network devices by any available method (e.g. telnet, ssh), communicate with
        them in their native interface (e.g. Juniper JunoScript, Cisco IOS), and return
        output. Utilizing the Twisted framework, Trigger is able to manage any number of
        jobs in parallel and handle output or errors as they return. With the high
        number of network devices on the AOL network this application is invaluable to
        performance and reliability.
