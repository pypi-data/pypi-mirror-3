        Introduction
        ============
        
        It is simply to use, needs no desktop application, everything is done
        through the web by uploading an "excel file" and configure its visualisations.
        
        See also initial project wiki page https://svn.eionet.europa.eu/projects/Zope/wiki/DaViz
        for the reasoning behind this project.
        
        
        Main features
        =============
        
        EEA Daviz generates different views and a customisable faceted search on CSV/TSV data
        uploaded in a Plone site. Just upload a CSV file under a normal Plone file and
        go to actions menu and click convert to exhibit view, the page will automatically
        refresh to edit the Exhibit view
        
        More details about how to use this package can be found at the following link:

        Installation
        ============
        
        To install eea.daviz into the global Python environment (or a workingenv),
        using a traditional Zope 2 instance, you can do this:
        
         * When you're reading this you have probably already run
           ``easy_install eea.daviz``. Find out how to install setuptools
           (and EasyInstall) here:
           http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall
        
         * If you are using Zope 2.9 (not 2.10), get `pythonproducts`_ and install it
           via::
        
               python setup.py install --home /path/to/instance
        
           into your Zope instance.
        
         * Create a file called ``eea.daviz-configure.zcml`` in the
           ``/path/to/instance/etc/package-includes`` directory.  The file
           should only contain this::
        
               <include package="eea.daviz" />
        
        .. _pythonproducts: http://plone.org/products/pythonproducts
        
        
        Alternatively, if you are using zc.buildout and the plone.recipe.zope2instance
        recipe to manage your project, you can do this:
        
          * Add ``eea.daviz`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.::
        
              [buildout]
              eggs = eea.daviz
        
          * Tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug::
        
              [instance]
              recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
              zcml = eea.daviz
        
          * Re-run buildout, e.g. with::
        
              $ ./bin/buildout
        
        You can skip the ZCML slug if you are going to explicitly include the package
        from another package's configure.zcml file.
