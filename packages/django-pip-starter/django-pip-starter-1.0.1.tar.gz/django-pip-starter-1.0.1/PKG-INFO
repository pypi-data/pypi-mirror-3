Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        Have you ever had problems deploying and configuring django project? This project
        removes headaches that you used to have when quick-starting django project, configuring
        environments, downloading packages and etc.
        
        Solution is based on pip and virtualenv and has minimal requirements
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        To install this package:
        
        ::
        
            pip install django-pip-starter
        
        
        Quick start
        ===========
        
        To create new project use the following command:
        
        ::
        
            django-pip-starter.py <dest>
        
        Where <dest> is destination folder where starter should create files.
        
        After than you can go into <dest> directory and type
        
        ::
        
            make
        
        This will download and setup development virtualenv, download latest stable django and create
        sqlite3 database, load initial data.
        
        To run development server you can use:
        
        ::
        
            make run
        
        Initial logins for django are u: admin p: admin
        
        You can also use default django commands as usual:
        
        ::
        
            project/manage.py runserver
        
        and etc.
        
        History
        =======
        
        Idea for this project came from Mantas Zimickas (sirex, https://bitbucket.org/sirex/django-starter/overview).
        This was based on zc.buildout solution. After some time using django-starter we had problems deploying it
        and Petras Zdanaviƒçius (petraszd) made a fork of django-starter that used only pip. This was simple and elegant solution
        that Marius Grigaitis (marltu) expanded and packaged it into this project.
