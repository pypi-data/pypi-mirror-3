Version 0.1:

    - initial release, derived from "Traffic mechanism" in TextTest 3.20
    - for changes compared to that version, see ChangeLog in TextTest 3.21 release

Version 0.1.1

    - Fix to make it work with test discovery, e.g. nosetests (thanks Kumar McMillan)

Version 0.2

Enhancements:

    - Added possibility to write a custom client, reusing the CaptureMock server. See website.

Bugfixes:

    - TCP backlog for server greatly increased to avoid trouble on overloaded networks
    - Command line now recreates rather than appending to any existing mock files
    - Now handle the situation where getattr creates new objects instead of just returning the same one
	for example when using xmlrpc
    - Don't cause __nonzero__ methods to be called unnecessarily on intercepted objects
    - Fixed bug which caused import problems when recording in some obscure situations
    - "check_repeated_calls" now also works with "partial interception", previously only worked when intercepting entire modules

Version 0.3

Enhancements:

    - Now support 'inheriting across the interception boundary'
	i.e. having your non-intercepted code inherit from classes you're intercepting
    - Traffic alterations ("alterations" in the RC file) now also enabled on traffic from custom clients
    - Can now enforce exact matching (i.e. disable the best-guess matching) when replaying. 
	New rc file entry "use_exact_matching". See website.

Bugfixes:

    - Warn when provided RC file doesn't exist

Version 0.3.1

Bugfixes:
	
    - Make sure wrapped functions that return values preserve the return values (Thanks Carol Lin)
