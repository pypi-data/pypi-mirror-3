Feature requests and pertinent bugs
===================================
(see also http://code.google.com/p/mdanalysis/issues/list )

* hydrogen bond analysis

* possibly use VMD's molfile plugins for reading?

* robust guessing of masses

* build a bonds list from a structure

* introduce new Residue classes such as AminoAcid(Residue) or
  NucleicAcid(Residue) with specific methods (e.g. phi/psi dihedrals);
  Bio.PDB has something like this

* add density data and enhance selections so that one can select
  molecules that are within a certain region
