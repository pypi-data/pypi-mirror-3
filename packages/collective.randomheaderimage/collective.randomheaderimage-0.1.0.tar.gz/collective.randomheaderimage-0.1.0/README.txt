Introduction
============

The main idea is to have a random image as background of header of the Plone Site.

The image has loaded from a Plone folder. 
This folder is configurable trough ZMI and it's applied to the portal_header as css style.

Configuration
-------------

From ZMI you need to customize the *folder_header_images_path* property inside the *site_properties*
property sheet.
