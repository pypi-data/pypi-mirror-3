Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        Products.openstudy is a Plone plugin that integrates live study group feeds with content in a Plone based website.
        
        This product is a joint project between enPraxis (http://enpraxis.net) and OpenStudy (http://openstudy.com) and was built to integrate study groups with eduCommons (http://educommons.com). Although eduCommons integration was the catalyst for development, this plugin can be used with any Plone 3 or Plone 4 based site.
        
        The Plone product provides a portlet in the right column that inserts the relevant javascript to provide a live data feed from the OpenStudy website. This feed is configurable via an action on an object ("studygroup" tab). Clicking on this tab provides a form which dynamically acquires a list of study groups from the OpenStudy web site, and populates a drop down control, allowing the relevant study group to be chosen.
        
        A control panel for the product is also included which provides configuration information, and will eventually contain fields for authenticating with and using the future planned OpenStudy API.
        
        See the install instructions for more details on how to install and use this product.
