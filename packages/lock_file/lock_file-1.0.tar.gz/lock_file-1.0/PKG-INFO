Description: 
        Lock files are used on Unix-like systems as a means of synchronization
        among processes. Only one process can hold a lock file. Other processes
        that want to acquire it have to wait until it is released by the
        holder.
        
        In this module the lock file is implemented as an empty regular file,
        exclusively locked using fcntl.flock. The file is removed when it is to
        be released.
