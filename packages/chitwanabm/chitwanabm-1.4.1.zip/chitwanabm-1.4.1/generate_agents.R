# Script used to generate a synthetic dataset of individuals, households, and 
# neighborhoods to be used in running the chitwanabm. This allows both modeling 
# the full population (as the CVFS is only a partial sample), and also allows 
# redistributing the model with an unrestricted population dataset. The CVFS 
# data is restricted access to protect respondent confidentiality.
