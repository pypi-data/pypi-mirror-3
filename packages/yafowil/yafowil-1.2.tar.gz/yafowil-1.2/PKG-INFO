Description: **Yet Another Form WIdget Library** (XHTML).
        
        YAFOWIL offers html-form creation and modification at runtime. Its light-weight
        and provides an extensible, reusable set of blueprints to build flexible forms.
        
        YAFOWIL is independent from any web-framework, but easy to use in your
        web-framework.
        
        It's all just about rendering widgets and extracting the data returned from the
        browser per widget. It does not fight with storage.
        
        YAFOWIL vary from most other HTML form packages: Its all just configuration. No
        subclassing needed any more; no specific schema-framework is necessary.
        
        Yafowil provides a factory where you can fetch your widgets instances from.
        Or you register your own.

        History
        =======
        
        1.2
        --------
        
        - naming makes a difference between blueprints and widgets
        [jensens, 2011-09-20]
        
        - fix traceback test
        [rnix, 2011-09-15]
        
        1.1.3
        -----
        
        - traceback supplement now with html support. test for html part is missing for now.
        [jensens, 2011-09-01]
        
        1.1.2
        -----
        
        - traceback supplement is now better formatted.
        [jensens, 2011-08-30]
        
        1.1.1
        -----
        
        - Bugfix: mode ``display`` did eat up all previous renderings. This made error
        widget fail in display mode to show the value. Fixed: empty_display_renderer
        proxies now all previous rendered.
        [jensens, 2011-08-11]
        
        1.1
        ---
        
        - Extend select widget for better UI control of selections and multi selections
        [rnix, 2011-08-05]
        
        - Plumb ``node.parts.Order`` to widget node
        [rnix, 2011-07-28]
        
        - define label and field renderer as display renderer as well
        [rnix, 2011-07-25]
        
        - deprecate use of mode widget
        [rnix, 2011-07-08]
        
        - now mode is a central element: each Widget instance has a mode now: edit,
        display or skip. edit is default and works as usal. Display renders the new
        display_renderer chain. Skip just renders an empty Unicode string.
        [jensens, 2011-07-07]

        - add ``novalidate`` property for form

        length.
        [rnix, 2011-05-07]

        [rnix, 2011-05-07]
        
        - add optional ``for`` property for label widget.

        [rnix, 2011-04-19]
