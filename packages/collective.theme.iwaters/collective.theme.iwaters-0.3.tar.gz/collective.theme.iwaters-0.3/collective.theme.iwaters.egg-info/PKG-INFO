        Overview
        --------
        
        This product is a installable Plone Theme developed by `IW:LEARN <http://iwlearn.net/>`_.
        
        The origins of this theme date back to 2005, it was converted to a deliverance theme in 2010.
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
            - Plone 4.1.x (http://plone.org/products/plone)
            - plone.app.theming
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Add Plone site
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Install Plone 4.1 with plone.app.theming and create a Plone site (if you have not already) with Diazo theming configured.
        
        
        Zip file
        ~~~~~~~~
        
        If you are an end user, you might enjoy installation via zip file import.
        
        Download the zip file: http://plone.org/products/collective.theme.iwaters/releases/0.2/iwaters.zip
        Import the theme from the Diazo theme control panel.
        
        With buildout
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        To use this skin, on a buildout based installation:
        
            Edit your buildout.cfg and add the following information::
        
                [buildout]
                ...
                eggs =
                    collective.theme.iwaters
                    plone.app.theming
        
        
        
            If another package depends on the collective.theme.iwaters egg or
            includes its zcml directly you do not need to specify anything in the
            buildout configuration: buildout will detect this automatically.
        
            After updating the configuration you need to run the ''bin/buildout'',
            which will take care of updating your system.
        
        Go to the 'Site Setup' page in the Plone interface and click on the
        'Add/Remove Products' link.
        
        Choose the product (check its checkbox) and click the 'Install' button.
        
        Uninstall -- This can be done from the same management screen, but only
        if you installed it from the quick installer.
        
        Note: You may have to empty your browser cache to see the effects of the
        product installation.
