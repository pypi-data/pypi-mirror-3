django-datefilterspec
=====================

Add the option to filter by a custom date range on the admin. This allows
to inputs to be used to get the custom date range filters.

See datefilter.png of a screenshot of how this is seen on the admin.

**IMPORTANT:** this will work with Django 1.4. I won't work with previous Django
versions.

Instalation
-----------

Use pip/easy_install

    pip install django-daterange-filter


In your *models.py*

    from daterange_filter.fields import DateRangeField

    class Example(models.Model):
        
        bar = DateRangeField(null=True, blank=True, etc...)
        bar.daterange_filter = True


It is important to use DateRangeField and not to use 
*django.db.models.DateField*, becuase the Django class doesn't acept any other
format than %m/%d/%yy. Because of this, it won't work if you are using a custom
date format on the *settings.py*. On the other hand, DateRangeField will allow
the custom DATE_INPUT_FORMATS defined on the *settings.py*.

See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10973748/django-model-datefield-to-python

In you *admin.py* file import the filter. This is the only line that should
be used for doing that:

    from daterange_filter import filter
