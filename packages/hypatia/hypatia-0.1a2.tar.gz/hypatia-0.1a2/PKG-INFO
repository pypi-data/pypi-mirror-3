Description: Hypatia
        =======
        
        A Python indexing and searching system.
        
        See http://github.com/Pylons/hypatia for more information while this package
        is in alpha development.
        
        
        0.1a2 (2012-07-02)
        ------------------
        
        - This version of the code is incompatible with indexes produced by 0.1a1.
          There is no upgrade script.  Shame on you for using software with a 0.1a1
          version number and expecting backwards compatibility.
        
        - Add `hypatia.catalog.CatalogQuery.sort` API for sorting external sets
          of docids based on index values.
        
        - Add ``IIndexEnumeration`` interface, which all indexes must support.
          This implied the following backwards incompatibilities:
        
          - New interface methods: docids, docids_count, indexed, indexed_count,
            not_indexed and not_indexed_count.
        
          - documentCount method renamed to indexed_count.
        
          - wordCount method renamed to word_count.
        
        - Remove unused INBest interface.
        
        - IIndexInjection interface ``clear`` method renamed to ``reset`` to prevent
          confusion with dictionary ``clear`` (catalog is often dictionarylike).
          Catalog ``clear_indexes`` method replaced with ``reset``.
