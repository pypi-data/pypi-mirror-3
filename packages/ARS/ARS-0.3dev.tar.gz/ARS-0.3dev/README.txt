ARS is a physically-accurate open-source simulation suite for research and
development of mobile manipulators and, in general, any multi-body system. It
is modular, easy to learn and use, and can be a valuable tool in the process
of robot design, in the development of control and reasoning algorithms, as
well as in teaching and educational activities.

It will encompass a wide range of tools spanning from kinematics and dynamics
simulation to robot interfacing and control.

The software is implemented in Python integrating the Open Dynamics Engine
(ODE) and the Visualization Toolkit (VTK).

REQUIREMENTS
* Python 2.7.3 (any 2.7 should work)
	http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.3/
* ODE (Open Dynamics Engine) 0.12 (from rev 1864 could work but is untested)
	http://sourceforge.net/projects/arsproject/files/ODE/
* VTK (Visualization Toolkit) 5.8.0 (previously was 5.2.1)
