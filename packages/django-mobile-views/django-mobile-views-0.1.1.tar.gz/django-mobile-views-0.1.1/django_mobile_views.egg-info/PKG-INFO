Description: 
        django-mobile-views is a simple app to help detect mobile browsers
        and serve a different template for them.
        
        It works by inspecting the user agent.
        
        
        To use, either use one of the mobile generic views, or add the MobileMixin
        to your class based view.
        
        from mobile_views.generic_views import MobileTemplateView
        
        class HomePage(MobileTemplateView):
            template_name = 'myapp/home_page.html'
            mobile_template_name = 'myapp/mobile_home_page.html'
        
        
        And that's it!
        
        There is also a 'FullSiteView' provided that when accessed will set a cookie
        to prevent being served the mobile template. The cookie lasts until browser close.
