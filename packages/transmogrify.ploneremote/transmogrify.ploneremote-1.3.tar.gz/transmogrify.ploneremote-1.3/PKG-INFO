        Introduction
        --------------
        
        *transmogrifier.ploneremote* is package of transmogrifier blueprints for 
        uploading content via Zope XML-RPC API to a Plone site.
        
        Plone site does not need any modifications, but vanilla Zope XML-RPC is used.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Five different blueprints are provided.
        
        Common Options
        ==============
        
        target
          Url of Plone folder to upload content. You will need to include the username and
          password using the url syntax. e.g. http://user:password@site.com/folder.
          If you'd prefer not to hardcode your password in a pipeline.cfg you can use
          `mr.migrator` which lets you override your pipeline using the commandline.
        
        path-key
          Which blueprint item dictionary key is used to extract the remote path information
          or the item. Default value *path* .
        
        
        transmogrify.ploneremote.constructor
        ====================================
        
        Drop in replacement for constructor that will use xmlprc calls to construct content on a remote plone site
        
        Options:
        
        :target:
          see `Common Options`_
        
        :path-key:
          see `Common Options`_
        
        :type-key:
          Key of the field with item type to create. Defaults to 'type','portal_type', 'Type','_type'
        
        :creation-key:
          Key of the field to determine if item should be created. Defaults to '_creation_flag'
        
        :alias-key:
          Key of the field with a path of where the original content was found such as by
          `transmogrifier.webcrawler`. `transmogrify.ploneremote.remoteredirector` will set
          this path as an alias which allows the constructor to find the same content if
          it is run a second time even if a the items desired path has changed. Defaults
          to '_origin_path'.
        
        :create-condition:
          TAL expression to determine if item should be added. Defaults to 'python:True'
        
        :move-condition:
          If the content has already been uploaded and then moved this TAL expression
          will determine if the content should be moved back. Default is 'python:True'
        
        :remove-condition:
          If the content has already been uploaded and is of a different type this
          TAL expression will determine if the item can be removed and recreated.
        
        
        
        transmogrify.ploneremote.remoteschemaupdater
        ============================================
        
        This will use XML-RPC to call Archetypes setXXX() mutator methods remotely
        to set field values.
        
        TODO: How to input schema fields
        
        Options:
        
        :target:
          see `Common Options`_
        
        :path-key:
          see `Common Options`_
        
        :condition:
          TAL Expression to determine to use this blueprint
        
        :skip-existing:
          Default is 'False'
        
        :skip_unmodified:
          if set to true and the items modification date is less than the modification date of
          the remote item then no fields will be updated. The modification date either comes
          from 'modificationDate' key in the item or the 'last-modified' header if item
          was from `transmogrify.webcrawler`.
        
        :headers-key:
          key for dictionary of headers such as added by transmogrify.webcrawler
        
        :skip_fields:
          Fields that won't be updated
        
        :creation_key:
          if skip existing is true and this field is set in the item the remote item is not updated
        
        transmogrify.ploneremote.remoteworkflowupdater
        ==============================================
        
        Triggers the state transition of the remote item workflow i.e.
        publishes the item if it is not public.
        
        Options:
        
        :target:
          see `Common Options`_
        
        :path-key:
          see `Common Options`_
        
        :transitions-key:
          which blueprint item dictionary key is used as the transition name
          for the item. 
        
        
        transmogrify.ploneremote.remoteredirector
        =========================================
        
        This blueprint adds redirection aliases to those content items that have changed
        it's paths during tranmogrification process. It takes into account item's
        *_orig_path* key set by webcrawler blueprint. Redirection uses
        Products.RedirectionTool Aliases form to add appropriate redirections. So this
        is required to install that addon in order to make
        *transmogrify.ploneremote.redirector* blueprint work.
        
        If *path* is not equal to *orig_path* then appropriate aliases is being added
        to local Plone utility (IRedirectionStorage) using Aliases form.
        
        
        Example::
        
                #
                # Add content aliases for content that changed it's paths
                # 
                [redirector]
                blueprint = transmogrify.ploneremote.remoteredirector
        
        Options:
        
        :target:
          see `Common Options`_
        
        :path-key:
          see `Common Options`_
        
        transmogrify.ploneremote.remoteprune
        ====================================
        
        Removes any items from a folder if it's not an item in the pipeline.
        
        Options:
        
        :target:
          see `Common Options`_
        
        :path-key:
          see `Common Options`_
        
        :prune-folder-key:
             which transmogrifier field is read to check
             if the prune folder is run against the remote folder.
             The default value os "_prune-folder"
        
        :trash-path:
          remote folder to set to move content items not specified locally. If empty
        
        transmogrify.ploneremote.remotenavigationexcluder
        =================================================
        
        Set "Exclude from Navigation" setting for remote Plone content items.
        
        Options:
        
        :target:
          see `Common Options`_
        
        :path-key:
          see `Common Options`_
        
        :exclude-from-navigation-key:
          Which key we use to read navigation exclusion hint.
          Default is 'exclude-from-navigation'

        =======================================
        
        Set static text portlets. If items contain a key such as '_left_portlet_text_1' it will create
        a static text portlet at '_path' as the first portlet on the left.
        
        :left-title-prefix:
          defaults to _left_portlet_title.
        
        :left-text-prefix:
          defaults to _left_portlet_text.
