Description:  This package provides couple of functions
        for solving some mathematical problems, like finding primes. They are
        intended to be very fast, and they are as fast as they can be. Hopefully,
        this will spare you from reinventing the whell when you need to do some
        basic mathematical calculations. Currently readme file is in Turkish, and
        yet no other documentation is available, but this may change in future.
