        Introduction
        ============
        
        Plonesocial.activitystream is part of the `plonesocial suite`_.
        
        This package provides a building block for Plone integrators who want to create a custom social business solution in Plone.
        
        If you're an end-user looking for a pre-integrated solution, you should install `plonesocial.suite`_ instead.
        
        
        plonesocial.activitystream
        ==========================
        
        Plonesocial.activitystream provides an "Activity Portal" view for the SiteRoot.
        
        The Activity Portal view renders a portletmanager viewlet in which you can add an "Activity Stream" portlet (and also a "Microblog" portlet if you installed plonesocial.microblog.
        
        This may look like a complex construct but it provides integrators with easy customization flex points, and it provides content managers with maximal control over what is rendered where, and in which sequence. Moreover by using a portlet for rendering, content managers can set various rendering options.
        
        You can re-use the viewlet, or the portlet, as you see fit using ZCML overrides. YMMV.
