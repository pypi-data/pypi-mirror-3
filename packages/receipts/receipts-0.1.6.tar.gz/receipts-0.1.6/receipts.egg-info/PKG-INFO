Description: Receipts
        --------------------------------
        
        Creates a python script called receipts that will find Web App receipts in
        your Firefox install and then allows you to check them against the verification
        service contained within the receipt.
        
        Tested on OS X, not sure about support for other operating systems yet.
        
        Install
        ---------------------------------
        
        Requirements: Python 2.7 and Firefox 14
        
        To install::
        
          pip install receipts
        
        This will install pyjwt and requirements.
        
        Usage
        ---------------------------------
        
        To list receipts::
        
          receipts -l
        
        To check a receipt for a specific domain::
        
          receipts -c DOMAINNAME
        
        To check all domains::
        
          receipts -c
        
        To expand a receipt for a specific domain::
        
          receipts -e DOMAINNAME
        
        To expand all domains::
        
          receipts -e
        
        By default receipts will try and find your default Firefox profile. If not it
        will use one provided with -p, eg::
        
          receipts -l -p fx6
