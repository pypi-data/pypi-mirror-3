Description: WSGI OpenPGP public key submission system
        =========================================
        
        pgpsubmit is a simple WSGI_ application that can be used for collecting
        OpenPGP_ public keys on a keyring e.g. for a keysigning party.
        
        .. _WSGI: http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3333/
        
        Features include:
        
        - submission deadline and "time remaining" display
        - keyring and key list export (with MD5 and SHA-1 hashes)
        - configured entirely through environment
        
        
        Dependencies
        ------------
        
        - `GnuPG`__
        - A WSGI capable web server (e.g. Apache_ with `mod_wsgi`__).
        
        .. _OpenPGP: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy
        .. _Apache: http://httpd.apache.org/
        __ http://gnupg.org/
        __ http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/
        
        
        Configuration
        -------------
        
        Two WSGI ``environ`` variables must be set:
        
        ``GNUPGHOME``
          The GnuPG home directory.  Must be writable by the user running the
          application.  Multiple pgpsubmit instances could be run in parallel,
          each with a different ``GNUPGHOME``.
        ``PGPSUBMITSOURCEURL``
          URL at which may be found the corresponding source of pgpsubmit,
          pursuant to section 15 of the AGPL.  If you run a modified version of
          pgpsubmit, the source code for that modified version must be available
          at this URL.
        
        There are also some other configuration variables:
        
        ``PGPSUBMITUNTIL``
          Specify a deadline for submission.  After this time, submission will
          be disabled, and a message to effect of same will appear.  While the
          deadline looms, time remaining will be displayed.  The format is
          ``'Y.M.D[.H[.M[.S]]]'``.
        ``PGPSUBMITDOWNLOADEARLY``
          If a deadline is set, links to download the keyring and key list are
          not shown until the submission deadline is reached.  Settings this
          environment variable (to any value) causes these links to be shown
          regardless of whether or not the deadline has passed.
        
        A configuration for Apache with mod_wsgi might be::
        
            <Directory /usr/home/joe/pgpsubmit>
                Order allow,deny
                Allow from all
            </Directory>
        
            <VirtualHost *:80>
                ServerAdmin joe@example.com
                ServerName pgpsubmit.example.com
                DocumentRoot "/usr/home/joe/pgpsubmit"
        
                WSGIScriptAlias / /usr/home/joe/pgpsubmit/scripts/pgpsubmit.wsgi
                SetEnv GNUPGHOME /usr/home/joe/.pgpsubmit
                SetEnv PGPSUBMITSOURCEURL https://gitorious.org/pgpsubmit
                SetEnv PGPSUBMITUNTIL 2011.12.31.18.30
            </VirtualHost>
