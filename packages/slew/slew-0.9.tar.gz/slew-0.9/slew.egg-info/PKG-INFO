Description: Slew GUI library
        ----------------
        
        An easy to use, multiplatform GUI library. Features include (but not limited to):
        - Backends-based architecture; currently there's one backend coded in C++ and based on Qt
        - Support for loading interface definitions from XML files
        - Complete widgets set, including (editable) item based views (Grid, TreeView, etc...)
        - Printing support
        - GDI classes to draw on top of bitmaps, on widgets, and while printing
        
        This version has been developed and tested on Python 2.7; support for Python 3.x may come in the future.
