Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        The main idea is to have a random image as background of header of the Plone Site.
        
        The image has loaded from a Plone folder. 
        This folder is configurable trough ZMI and it's applied to the portal_header as css style.
        
        Configuration
        -------------
        
        From ZMI you need to customize the *folder_header_images_path* property inside the *site_properties*
        property sheet.
