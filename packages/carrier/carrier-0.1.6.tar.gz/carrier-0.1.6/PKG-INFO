Description: Carrier: Warehouse and PyPI Synchronization
        ===========================================
        
        Carrier is a BSD Licensed Python application for keeping a Warehouse instance
        and PyPI synchronized.
        
        Carrier utilizes the xmlrpc and pubhubsubbub API of PyPI to keep a Warehouse
        instance up to date with PyPI. It can also utilize webhooks from Warehouse to
        propagate changes made in Warehouse to PyPI. It enables a clean separation of
        Warehouse and PyPI.
        
        Carrier is part of the Crate project, a set of applications, tools, and libraries
        for creating, distributing, and installing Python packages in a secure, efficient,
        and reliable way.
