<h1>Products<a class="headerlink" href="#products" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The core of any online store is the product  you are selling.  Some people may have very simple needs for categorizing and describing their products,
while others may have much more complex needs.  Satchmo&#8217;s product framework tries to strike a balance, enabling easy product configuration but supporting
complex products if your needs demand.</p>
<div class="section" id="categories">
<span id="index-0"></span><h2>Categories<a class="headerlink" href="#categories" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Out of the box, Satchmo supports the traditional hierarchical method for categorizing products.  In other words, you can create category trees like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Movies<ul>
<li>Action</li>
<li>Western</li>
<li>Comedy</li>
<li>Black and White<ul>
<li>Foreign</li>
<li>English</li>
<li>Silent</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Books<ul>
<li>Fiction</li>
<li>Non-fiction</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Some things to keep in mind with Satchmo&#8217;s implementation:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>You are not limited to the number of categories or the depth of categories.</li>
<li>You are allowed to add products to 1 or more product categories</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>When entering a category in the admin interface, you will have several fields to fill in.  Below is a description of each field and how it is used:</p>
<blockquote>
<table class="docutils field-list" frame="void" rules="none">
<col class="field-name" />
<col class="field-body" />
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="field"><th class="field-name">Name:</th><td class="field-body">The name of this specific category.  It is the text seen by the user to describe this category.  In the example above, Movies, Action, etc. are all names.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="field"><th class="field-name">Slug:</th><td class="field-body">This is a prepopulated field that is used in the url to identify the category.  One aspect that Django encourages is well designed urls.  The slug field is commonly used so that a url &#8220;makes sense&#8221; when you look at it.  The nice side effect of this is that in some cases, search engines will give higher ranking for sites with cleaner urls.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="field"><th class="field-name">Parent:</th><td class="field-body">If a category is at the top of the tree, then there is no parent.  In our example above, Movies and Books have no parents.  While Action, Comedy, Black and White would all have Movies as a parent.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="field"><th class="field-name">Meta:</th><td class="field-body">When an HTML page is constructed, certain meta information can be added to the page which makes it easier for search engines to classify your pages and your products.  This field is used to enter information about your category that may not be readily seen by just looking at a description.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="field"><th class="field-name">Description:</th><td class="field-body">This is a free form field that describes this category.  You can use this to help guide users in your site.  It&#8217;s also helpful for search engines.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="field"><th class="field-name">Ordering:</th><td class="field-body">This field can be used to specify which order the categories should be displayed.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="field"><th class="field-name">Active:</th><td class="field-body">This allows a category to be populated with information but to be set inactive.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section" id="product">
<span id="index-1"></span><h2>Product<a class="headerlink" href="#product" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A Product is the main focus of your store.  It is the &#8220;thing&#8221; that a person going to your store would see.</p>
<p>To activate the various product modules, they need to be enabled in your settings.py
file. For example:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ...
        'product',
        'product.modules.configurable',
        'product.modules.custom',
        'product.modules.downloadable',
        'product.modules.subscription',
        ...</pre>
</div>
<p>Once the products have been added, there are many fields you can use to configure your Items.</p>
<blockquote>
<table class="docutils field-list" frame="void" rules="none">
<col class="field-name" />
<col class="field-body" />
<tbody valign="top">

</tr>
<tr class="field"><th class="field-name">Slug:</th><td class="field-body">This is similar to the slug field in category.  It is a brief description of the item that will show up in the url and uniquely identify this product.</td>

<tr class="field"><th class="field-name">Description:</th><td class="field-body">Free form text fields that tell a potential customer about this item and why they may want to purchase it.</td>

<tr class="field"><th class="field-name" colspan="2">Short_description:</th></tr>

<tr class="field"><th class="field-name">Date_added:</th><td class="field-body">The date you added this product to your store.  It could be useful for showing a list of new products.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="field"><th class="field-name">Active:</th><td class="field-body">A flag to identify which items are still valid in the store.  If you decide you don&#8217;t want to show an item for purchase, we recommend making it Active=False instead of trying to delete it.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="field"><th class="field-name">Featured:</th><td class="field-body">Another flag which can be used to identify special items that you may want to highlight in your site. In the default templates, featured items show-up on the front page of the store.</td>

<tr class="field"><th class="field-name">Items in stock:</th><td class="field-body">The inventory of this specific item.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="field"><th class="field-name">Meta:</th><td class="field-body">This meta field is similar to the one described above in the category.  It&#8217;s basically some additional descriptive language you might want to include in your HTML that does not already show up in the description.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="field"><th class="field-name" colspan="2">Weight, Length and Height:</th></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class="field-body">These dimensions are for your use in displaying the item&#8217;s info. It can also be used for shipping calculations.</td>

</tr>
<tr class="field"><th class="field-name">Tax_class:</th><td class="field-body">Allows you to set the rate at which tax is calculated.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="field"><th class="field-name">Related_items:</th><td class="field-body">Certain products may naturally be grouped together.  If you were to purchase a movie, you might want to include links to the book
based on the movie or maybe a movie poster.  This would be the place to record those linkages. By default, this does not show up in the
store. You will need to modify your templates to display it.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="field"><th class="field-name">Also_purchased:</th><td class="field-body">Another field to show relationships between products.  This can be useful if you want to try to increase sales by showing what others have purchased when they bought this product.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="field"><th class="field-name">Price:</th><td class="field-body">An item has multiple ways to determine a price.  For a simple single-price all the time item, just enter a price with a &#8220;Discount Quantity&#8221; of 1, and a blank &#8220;Expires&#8221; date.  More detailed options are spelled out in the Price and ConfigurableProduct sections below.</td>

<div class="section" id="product-attributes">
<span id="index-2"></span><h3>Product Attributes<a class="headerlink" href="#product-attributes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In some cases, you may want to have certain product information stored in the database.  For instance, you might want to have &#8220;number of pages&#8221; or &#8220;ISBN&#8221; fields
for all of the books in your store.  Attributes allow you to associate arbitrary data with your products via name, value pairs.</p>
<p>In the latest version of Satchmo, these are more powerful and useful because you can define specific
attributes to capture as well as validation to perform on the data.</p>
<p>Refer to <a class="reference internal" href="product-attributes.html"><em>Custom Product Attributes</em></a> for more details on using this feature to customize the information
you store and present for your products.</p>

<div class="section" id="price">
<span id="index-3"></span><h3>Price<a class="headerlink" href="#price" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The final choice you have with your products is if there is additional pricing you would like to apply for bulk or special discounts.  For instance, you may want to charge someone $10 for 1-5 shirts but only $7 if they order 6 or more.  This model allows you to do such configuration.</p>

<div class="section" id="images">
<span id="index-4"></span><h3>Images<a class="headerlink" href="#images" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In addition to the information discussed above, you can add as many images as you would like to your item.  One of the nice things about the way Satchmo handles these images is that they are automatically converted to thumbnails and are cached so that the conversion process does not slow down your web site.</p>
<p>Images only have a couple of fields:</p>
<blockquote>
<table class="docutils field-list" frame="void" rules="none">
<col class="field-name" />
<col class="field-body" />
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="field"><th class="field-name">Picture:</th><td class="field-body">This is the image of your item that you upload to the web server.  The actual thumbnail size is set in your templates.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="field"><th class="field-name">Caption:</th><td class="field-body">A description of this image.  This field may be used to describe the different angles that images show.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="field"><th class="field-name">Sort:</th><td class="field-body">If you would like control of the order in which the images are displayed, this field can be used.</td>
</tr>

</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="product-options">
<span id="index-5"></span><h2>Product Options<a class="headerlink" href="#product-options" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>As discussed above, a product is the central focus of your store.  For many cases, the products in your store may have several options.  For instance, if you sell t-shirts, a visitor to your store should be able to choose the size of the shirt while looking at the main item.  You may also want them to choose a color, style and/or a bunch of other different options.  The challenge with this much flexibility is building something that is easy for the user to understand and easy for the store administrator to maintain.  Satchmo uses option groups and options to create configurable products and product variants.</p>
<div class="section" id="option-groups">
<h3>Option Groups<a class="headerlink" href="#option-groups" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Continuing on with the shirt example, you will probably end up with some similar options that you want to apply to a large number of products.  For instance, all of your shirts are going to have sizes of Small, Medium and Large.  Instead of adding all three of these to each item, you can create an option group and add that grouping to the item.  Maintenance is much easier this way.</p>
<p>Here are the fields in the option groups:</p>
<blockquote>
<table class="docutils field-list" frame="void" rules="none">
<col class="field-name" />
<col class="field-body" />
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="field"><th class="field-name">Name:</th><td class="field-body">A description of the group.  This is displayed in the product page to describe the choices available to the user.  In our shirt instance, &#8220;size&#8221; would be appropriate.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="field"><th class="field-name">Description:</th><td class="field-body">This field is used for administrative purposes.  Size may make sense when looking at a product but what if you have shirts, shoes and hats?  How do you know which group these sizes apply to?  Use this field to write details about the size.  For instance, you could have an option group with the description &#8220;Shirt Sizes&#8221;, &#8220;Hat Sizes&#8221; and &#8220;Shoe Sizes.&#8221;</td>
</tr>
<tr class="field"><th class="field-name">Sort Order:</th><td class="field-body">This helps you order the options in the way you would like them displayed.  For instance, you may want colors to show before sizes.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section" id="options">
<h3>Options<a class="headerlink" href="#options" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In our example, if an option group is size, then the options would be &#8220;small&#8221;, &#8220;medium&#8221; or &#8220;large.&#8221;  The nice thing about these options is that you can configure these to change the price of your product.  If a large shirt costs more than a small shirt, then you can assign the incremental cost to the &#8220;large&#8221; option item and the correct price will be shown in the users cart and order.</p>

For example, if your ConfigurableProduct is a t-shirt, then you will probably have ProductVariations for &#8220;Large Green t-shirt&#8221;, &#8220;Small Blue t-shirt&#8221;, etc.  It&#8217;s easiest to have these generated for you using the create_variations option above, but once they are created, you can edit these individually to do things such as set a different price for the XL shirt.</td>

<p>As described above a ProductVariation can be thought of as the actual product you maintain in inventory and sell to a customer.  It is an item with all of the options applied.  In our example case, it might be a Large, White Shirt. The ProductVariation object itself only has links between a ConfigurableProduct, and a Product.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="downloadable-product">
<span id="index-8"></span><h3>Downloadable Product<a class="headerlink" href="#downloadable-product" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A downloadable product is a virtual product that will be electronically delivered to a customer after the purchase is completed.
In Satchmo, this is accomplished by emailing a unique url to a customer after the purchase.  This url can be restricted so that the possibility of multiple downloads is minimized.  Depending on your product you may want to add additional security controls but that is outside the scope of Satchmo.</p>
<p>In order for the downloadable product to be secured, you will need to ensure
that the protected directory can not be browsed to directly; you should also
ensure that the directory where the file is stored on the server is protected
from other users.</p>

<div class="section" id="custom-product">
<span id="index-9"></span><h3>Custom Product<a class="headerlink" href="#custom-product" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A custom product is one that is typically assembled or made to order based on the customer&#8217;s needs. A common situation is a computer configurator that allows a customer to tailor the computer to their needs. Once the order is submitted the store owner will then build or configure that product.</p>
<p>Once you have created a product as described above, you may wish to use it as a basis for a custom product. The most important additional information you need to associate with your product is the option groups or custom text fields the customer may use to create their product. The option groups are no different from the ones described above. This gives you tremendous flexibility to vary the price of the product based on the chosen options. The custom text fields are free form text fields meant to capture special notes or instructions related to the order.</p>
<p>One unique aspect of the custom product is that you can elect to charge only a certain percentage at the time the order is placed. If you choose a percent downpayment then only that amount will be charged when the order is completed. If you choose 100%, then the entire price will be charged at checkout.</p>
<p>The final unique aspect is that you can elect to defer shipping charges on the order. If you are creating a very unique product, you may wish to have that discussion with the customer when you are collecting the full payment.</p>
<p>The custom product does not create product variations. The downside of this is that you must manage your inventory yourself but the upside is that you don&#8217;t have all of those different configurations in your store. Feel free to play around with both products and see which one meets your needs the best.</p>

<span id="index-10"></span><h3>Subscription Product<a class="headerlink" href="#subscription-product" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A subscription product is a product type that can be used to manage recurring billing memberships or to add payment terms to a non-membership product.</p>
<p>In order to use this product,make sure you have the Subscription Product type enabled in the configuration settings. Additionally, if you would like to use a url to activate the rebilling, you will need to make sure the the setting ALLOW_URL_REBILL is set to True. If you do set it to True, make sure that you add a new unique key in the CRON_KEY setting.</p>
<p>To use a subscription product, you need to setup a base Product as described in the sections above.  The price you set for the base product will be the amount that is charged to your customer periodically based on your subscription schedule</p>
<p>In order to use this product type, from the Product detail page, choose Add Subscription Product.</p>
<p>On this screen, you will enter your subscription payment terms as described below.</p>

<p>Cronjob:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In order for recurring billing to work, you need to setup a cronjob on your server to run once a day
(preferably in the middle of the night).  There are a couplf of options to do this.</p>
<p>Using satchmo&#8217;s custom management command:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>0 23 * * * python manage.py satchmo_bill_recurring</pre>
</div>
<p>Using lynx:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>0 23 * * * /usr/bin/lynx -source http://yourdomain.com/shop/checkout/cron/?key=YOURPASSKEY
You will need to set the CRON_KEY variable in your settings file to your desired passphrase.</pre>
</div>
<p>Using a shell script:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>0 23 * * * sh /path/to/satchmo/rebilling_cron.sh</pre>
</div>
<p>If you use this method, make sure to edit the path on the first line of rebilling_cron.sh to point to the directory containing the script.</p>
