Creating your own component
---------------------------

A Helmholtz component is a Django "app". If you are unfamiliar with Django, the
best way to get started is to work through the
`Django tutorial <http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.2/intro/tutorial01/>`_.

We will add more extensive documentation here in the next release.
