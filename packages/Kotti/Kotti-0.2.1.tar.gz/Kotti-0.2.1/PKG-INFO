Description: Kotti is a user-friendly, light-weight and extensible `web content
        management system`_.  It is licensed under a `BSD-like license
        <http://repoze.org/license.html>`_
        
        Features
        ========
        
        - **User-friendly**: a simple edit interface hides advanced
          functionality from less experienced users
        
        - **WYSIWYG editor**: includes a rich text editor that lets you edit
          content like in office applications
        
        - **Security**: advanced user, groups and user roles management; uses
          `access control lists`_ (ACL) to control access to different parts
          of the site
        
        - **Templating**: extend Kotti with your own look & feel with very
          little programming required
        
        - **Customizable**: Many aspects of Kotti are configured through a
          simple INI file
        
        - **Add-ons**: a plug-in system allows third party software to greatly
          extend Kotti
        
        - **Pluggable authentication**: allows authentication of users through
          LDAP or other existing user databases
        
        - **Open**: built on top of well-documented, open source components,
          such as Python_, Pyramid_ and SQLAlchemy_
        
        - **Tested**: an automated test coverage of 100% guarantees Kotti's
          stability

        History
        =======
        
        0.2.1 - 2011-09-29
        ------------------
        
        - Minor changes to events setup code to ease usage in tests.
        
        0.2 - 2011-09-16
        ----------------
        
        - No changes.
        
        0.2a2 - 2011-09-05
        ------------------
        
        - Fix templates to be compatible with Chameleon 2.  Also, require
          Chameleon>=2.
        
        - Require pyramid>=1.2.  Also, enable pyramid_debugtoolbar for
          ``development.ini`` profile.
        
        0.2a1 - 2011-08-29
        ------------------
        
        - Improve database schema for ``Nodes``.  Split ``Node`` class into
          ``Node`` and ``Content``.
        
          This change is backward incompatible in that existing content types
          in your code will need to subclass ``Content`` instead of ``Node``.
          The example in the docs has been updated.  Also, the underlying
          database schema has changed.
        
        - Improve user database hashing and local roles storage.
        
        - Compatibility fix for Pyramid 1.2.
        
        0.1.1 - 2011-05-17
        ------------------
        
        - Fix an installation issue with ``colander`` and ``dependency_links``.
        
        0.1 - 2011-05-04
        ----------------
        
        - Add persistent settings, which allow the overriding of registry
          settings and carry along with them the version of the last update.
        
        0.1a9 - 2011-04-12
        ------------------
        
        - Add 'in_navigation' flag for all Nodes to control whether or not it
          appears in the navigation.
        
        - Improvements related to writing add-ons.
        
        0.1a8 - 2011-03-18
        ------------------
        
        - Add slots/portlets through which third party packages can extend
          Kotti and put fragments of markup into the site's HTML.  Look at the
          ``kotti.views.slots`` for documentation.
        
        - Enable AJAX forms in the Move screen and add Growl-like notification
          for messages.
        
        - Fixed silly packaging problem with 0.1a7 release.  Install would
          fail with ``README.rst: No such file or directory`` before.
        
        - Fix bug with TinyMCE which would trigger "Are you sure you want to
          leave this page?" all the time.
        
        0.1a7
        -----
        
        - Add a user management screen for adding new users and assigning them
          to roles and groups globally.  Allow new users to set their own
          passwords.
        
        - Add "forgotten password" button to login screen; sends an e-mail
          with a reset password link.
        
        - Add a simple user preferences screen.
        
        - Ditch 'kotti.configuration' in favour of 'pyramid.settings'.
        
        0.1a6
        -----
        
        - Kotti now has a 100% automated test coverage, testing a total of
          some 950 lines of code.
        
        - Add a user dropdown menu in the edit interface that display's the
          currently logged in user's name and contains links to Site Setup (in
          the works) and Logout.
        
        - Require Chameleon < 1.2.999 since higher version cause compatibility
          issues with ``pyramid`` and ``deform``.
        
        - Implemented a simple events system in ``kotti.events`` that's akin
          to Zope3's object events.  See the module for documentation and
          examples.
        
        - Add a ``request_cache`` cache decorator in ``kotti.util`` for
          memoizing function results in the current request.  Cut down number
          of recursive queries run by ``kotti.security.list_groups_ext``.
        
        0.1a5
        -----
        
        - Add sharing screen.
        
          This allows you to set roles for groups and users on individual
          folders.  This also considers roles that are inherited from higher
          up in the hierarchy, and those that are inherited from groups that
          the user belongs to.
        
        - Refined available system roles in ``kotti.security.ROLES``.  We now
          have:
        
          - Viewer: view
          - Editor: view, add, edit
          - Owner: view, add, edit, manage
          - Admin: all permissions
        
        0.1a4
        -----
        
        - Added login form.
        
          With the development profile in ``development.ini``, log in with
          user 'admin' and password 'qwerty'.  User management and sharing tab
          is a TODO.
        
        - Add a default user database implementation in
          ``kotti.security.Principals``.
          
          Override with ``kotti.principals`` configuration setting.
        
        - Add inheritbale, nested groups support.
          
          Groups are stored in ``Node.__groups__``.  The API is
          ``kotti.security.list_groups`` and ``kotti.security.set_groups``.
