Description: The geoportlet works as a wrapper around the exiting portlet types.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        When you select the "Geoportlet" type under "Manage portlets", the add
        form lets you select from a database of countries and languages, and
        choose a portlet type. In the next screen, you'll create the chosen
        portlet (if it requires user input).
        
        The geoportlet toggles its availability based on IP address lookup
        and/or HTTP language accept strings. You can use it to segment the
        audience for a portlet into particular countries or language groups,
        e.g. China and Mandarin.
        
        It uses the geolocation database provided by http://Software77.net.
        
        Compatibility: Plone 4+.
        
        
        HTML
        ----
        
        Each geoportlet wraps the contained portlet assignment in an HTML
        ``<div>`` element with CSS-classes corresponding to the selected
        countries and/or languages. The format is ``geoportlet-<country>`` and
        ``geoportlet-<language>`` where the country is provided as the
        three-letter `ISO 3166-1 alpha-3
        <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-3>`_ country code and
        the language is provided as the two-letter `ISO 639-1
        <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-1>`_ language code::
        
          <div class="geoportlet-dnk geoportlet-da">
             <div class="portlet ...">
                ...
             </div>
          </div>

        Changelog
        =========
        
        1.0.2 (2012-06-14)
        ------------------
        
        - When first creating a geoportlet, use the contained assignment's
          title as the portlet title. This ensures that we get a suitable name
          from the ``INameChooser`` adapter.
        
        - Fixed traversal issue that prevented the editing of portlets with a
          "null" edit-form.
        
        - Fixed security checking issue.
        
        1.0.1 (2012-06-06)
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed a compatibility issue with Python 2.6.
        
        - Fixed an issue where the geolocation database location would not get
          a default value.
        
        1.0 (2012-06-06)
        ----------------
        
        - Initial public release.
