.sp
The \fBbeet\fP command reads configuration information from \fB~/.beetsconfig\fP on
Unix\-like OSes (inluding Mac OS X) and \fB%APPDATA%\ebeetsconfig.ini\fP on Windows.
The file is in INI format.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
These options are available, all of which must appear under the \fB[beets]\fP
section header:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBlibrary\fP
Path to the beets library file. Defaults to \fB~/.beetsmusic.blb\fP on Unix
and \fB%APPDATA\ebeetsmusic.blb\fP on Windows.
.TP
.B \fBdirectory\fP
The directory to which files will be copied/moved when adding them to the
library. Defaults to \fB~/Music\fP.
.TP
.B \fBimport_copy\fP
Either \fByes\fP or \fBno\fP, indicating whether to copy files into the library
directory when using \fBbeet import\fP. Defaults to \fByes\fP.  Can be
overridden with the \fB\-c\fP and \fB\-C\fP command\-line options.
.TP
.B \fBimport_write\fP
Either \fByes\fP or \fBno\fP, controlling whether metadata (e.g., ID3) tags are
written to files when using \fBbeet import\fP. Defaults to \fByes\fP. The \fB\-w\fP
and \fB\-W\fP command\-line options override this setting.
.TP
.B \fBimport_delete\fP
Either \fByes\fP or \fBno\fP. When enabled in conjunction with \fBimport_copy\fP,
deletes original files after they are copied into your library. This might
be useful, for example, if you\(aqre low on disk space \-\- but it\(aqs risky!
Defaults to \fBno\fP.
.TP
.B \fBimport_resume\fP
Either \fByes\fP, \fBno\fP, or \fBask\fP. Controls whether interrupted imports
should be resumed. "Yes" means that imports are always resumed when
possible; "no" means resuming is disabled entirely; "ask" (the default)
means that the user should be prompted when resuming is possible. The \fB\-p\fP
and \fB\-P\fP flags correspond to the "yes" and "no" settings and override this
option.
.TP
.B \fBimport_incremental\fP
Either \fByes\fP or \fBno\fP, controlling whether imported directories are
recorded and whether these recorded directories are skipped.  This
corresponds to the \fB\-i\fP flag to \fBbeet import\fP.
.TP
.B \fBimport_art\fP
Either \fByes\fP or \fBno\fP, indicating whether the autotagger should attempt
to find and download album cover art for the files it imports.  Defaults to
\fByes\fP. The \fB\-r\fP and \fB\-R\fP command\-line options override this setting.
.TP
.B \fBimport_quiet_fallback\fP
Either \fBskip\fP (default) or \fBasis\fP, specifying what should happen in
quiet mode (see the \fB\-q\fP flag to \fBimport\fP, above) when there is no
strong recommendation.
.TP
.B \fBimport_timid\fP
Either \fByes\fP or \fBno\fP, controlling whether the importer runs in \fItimid\fP
mode, in which it asks for confirmation on every autotagging match, even the
ones that seem very close. Defaults to \fBno\fP. The \fB\-t\fP command\-line flag
controls the same setting.
.TP
.B \fBimport_log\fP
Specifies a filename where the importer\(aqs log should be kept.  By default,
no log is written. This can be overridden with the \fB\-l\fP flag to
\fBimport\fP.
.TP
.B \fBignore\fP
A space\-separated list of glob patterns specifying file and directory names
to be ignored when importing. Defaults to \fB.AppleDouble ._* *~ .DS_Store\fP.
.TP
.B \fBart_filename\fP
When importing album art, the name of the file (without extension) where the
cover art image should be placed. Defaults to \fBcover\fP (i.e., images will
be named \fBcover.jpg\fP or \fBcover.png\fP and placed in the album\(aqs
directory).
.TP
.B \fBplugins\fP
A space\-separated list of plugin module names to load. For instance, beets
includes the BPD plugin for playing music.
.TP
.B \fBpluginpath\fP
A colon\-separated list of directories to search for plugins.  These paths
are just added to \fBsys.path\fP before the plugins are loaded. The plugins
still have to be contained in a \fBbeetsplug\fP namespace package.
.TP
.B \fBthreaded\fP
Either \fByes\fP or \fBno\fP, indicating whether the autotagger should use
multiple threads. This makes things faster but may behave strangely.
Defaults to \fByes\fP.
.TP
.B \fBcolor\fP
Either \fByes\fP or \fBno\fP; whether to use color in console output (currently
only in the \fBimport\fP command). Turn this off if your terminal doesn\(aqt
support ANSI colors.
.TP
.B \fBtimeout\fP
The amount of time that the SQLite library should wait before raising an
exception when the database lock is contended. This should almost never need
to be changed except on very slow systems. Defaults to 5.0 (5 seconds).
.UNINDENT
.sp
You can also configure the directory hierarchy beets uses to store music. That
uses the \fB[paths]\fP section instead of the \fB[beets]\fP section. Each string is
a \fI\%Python template string\fP that can refer to metadata fields (see below for
examples). The extension is added automatically to the end. At the moment, you
can specify two special paths: \fBdefault\fP (for most releases) and \fBcomp\fP (for
"various artist" releases with no dominant artist). You can also specify a
different path format for each \fI\%MusicBrainz release type\fP. The defaults look
like this:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[paths]
default: $albumartist/$album/$track $title
comp: Compilations/$album/$track title
singleton: Non\-Album/$artist/$title
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Note the use of \fB$albumartist\fP instead of \fB$artist\fP; this ensure that albums
will be well\-organized. (For more about these format strings, see
\fBpathformat\fP.)
.SH EXAMPLE
.sp
Here\(aqs an example file:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[beets]
library: /var/music.blb
directory: /var/mp3
path_format: $genre/$artist/$album/$track $title
import_copy: yes
import_write: yes
import_resume: ask
import_art: yes
import_quiet_fallback: skip
import_timid: no
import_log: beetslog.txt
ignore: .AppleDouble ._* *~ .DS_Store
art_filename: albumart
plugins: bpd
pluginpath: ~/beets/myplugins
threaded: yes
color: yes

[paths]
default: $genre/$albumartist/$album/$track $title
soundtrack: Soundtracks/$album/$track $title
comp: $genre/$album/$track $title
singleton: Singletons/$artist \- $track

[bpd]
host: 127.0.0.1
port: 6600
password: seekrit
.ft P
.fi
.sp
(That \fB[bpd]\fP section configures the optional \fBBPD\fP
plugin.)
.SH LOCATION
.sp
The configuration file is typically located at \fB$HOME/.beetsconfig\fP. If you
want to store your \fB.beetsconfig\fP file somewhere else for whatever reason, you
can specify its path by setting the \fBBEETSCONFIG\fP environment variable.
