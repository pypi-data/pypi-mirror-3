Changelog
=========

1.1.0 (2012-09-10)
------------------

- Some refactoring for code readability.

- Use a `os.pipe()` pair and `select.select()` instead of
  `threading.Condition` to signal when the monitor should stop tracing
  the original thread. This avoids a performance bottleneck in some
  VMWare installations, which seem not to have good performance for locks
  in certain conditions.

- Integrate the logging mechanism with Zope's signal handling and ZConfig's
  rotating file handler so that USR2 signals will cause the long request log
  to get reopened analogous to the access and event log.

1.0.0 (2010-10-28)
------------------

- Initial release
