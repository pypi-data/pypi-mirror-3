# Introduction

seantis.dir.base allows to put dexterity objects into 1-4 categories, showing those categories in a browsable and searchable catalog.

The idea of this plone module is to provide all basic functionality needed to categorize, search and filter objects. These objects may be extended with custom fields using dexterity.

An example, offering a directory of contacts can be found here:
[https://github.com/seantis/seantis.dir.contacts](https://github.com/seantis/seantis.dir.contacts)

This module is probably only really useful for anyone if used as a base to build on. By itself it only offers the categorization and search functionalities.
