Contributing to Lokai
_______________________________________________________________________

We welcome contributions to Lokai, either in the form of modifications
to the basic system, or as extensions to be included as part of the
distribution. You are also welcome to produce extensions that you
distribute yourself under whatever terms you feel are appropriate.

At the moment, for this early version of the software and the
distribution, we are not able to provide the usual tools for
contributors. These will come soon. However, you can comment on the
software and discuss issues directly with the maintainer. 

If you want to suggest changes, or offer patches, please do so. For
anything more than a line or two we will need you to prove that you
are able to contribute the Intellectual Property and we are working on
a Contributor License agreement for that.

The most important thing immediately is opening up the 
:page:`ticket list <Tickets>` and the 
:page:`Notes and Comments <Notes and Comments>` 
pages so that registered users can add to them. This
depends on an initial modification to the Lokai permission settings
and is being actively looked at.
