Changelog
=========

1.0b6 (2012-08-03)
------------------

    - Fix brown bag release.
      [zupo]


1.0b5 (2012-08-03)
------------------

    - Sort subfolders and filenames after you read it from the filesystem; this
      avoids different order of subdirs/files on different OSes.
      [zupo]

    - When the portal type is "News Item" it checks whether the file is an image or
      not, and acts accordingly [sithmel]


1.0b4 (2011-08-31)
------------------

    - Add autoinclude entry targetting ``transmogrify`` to provide
      ``mr.migrator`` support. This means folks can list this package
      in their ``mr.migrator`` sections (in buildout.cfg) and mr.migrator
      will load its ZCML.

    - Added option 'delimiter' so you can choose a character that delimits
