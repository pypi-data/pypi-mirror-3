        ************
        
        Introduction
        ============
        
        This library packages `html5shiv`_ for `fanstatic`_.
        
        .. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
        .. _`html5shiv`: https://github.com/aFarkas/html5shiv
        
        This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
        and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
        directory in ``js.html5shiv``) are published to some URL.
        
        
        How to use?
        ===========
        
        You can import ``html5shiv`` from ``js.html5shiv`` and ``need`` it where you want
        these resources to be included on a page::
        
          >>> from js.html5shiv import html5shiv
          >>> html5shiv.need()
