Description: ZooKeeper Python bindings
        =========================
        
        This is a self-contained distribution of the ZooKeeper Python
        bindings. It should build on any unix-like system by just running the
        ``setup.py`` script or using an install tool like pip, easy_install or
        buildout. (Windows patches to the setup script are welcomne. :)
        
        For more information **except** building instructions, see the file
        ORIGINAL-README included in the source distribution.
        
        If you have setuptools or distribute in your python path, then you can
        use the ``setup.py test`` command to run the tests.  Note, however,
        that the tests require that a testing ZooKeeper server be running on
        port 22182 of the local machine.
