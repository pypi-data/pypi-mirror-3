pluginbuilder - Create standalone Mac OS X plugins with Python
==============================================================

pluginbuilder is a Python package which will allow you to make standalone plugins from Python 
scripts. This plugin can then be used by an Objective-C application (through ``NSBundle``). 
pluginbuilder is a fork of `py2app`_, but without the distutils based command or the ability to 
create application bundles.

For installation information, refer to the documentation in the "doc" folder (you need Sphinx to
build it). The documentation is also available online at http://www.hardcoded.net/docs/pluginbuilder .
