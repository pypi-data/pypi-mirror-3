An example for indentation, \\
{{ Span( 'Second level', style={ 'margin-left' : '4em'} ) }} \\

=== Text with html special chars

>>> it = [ 1, 2, 3, ]   \
>>> print type(it)      \
    < List  type ... >

== Links

You can use [[internal links]] or [[http://www.wikicreole.org|external links]],
Here's another sentence: This wisdom is taken from [[Ward Cunningham's]]
[[http://www.c2.com/doc/wikisym/WikiSym2006.pdf|Presentation at the Wikisym 06]].

Here's a external link without a description: [[http://www.wikicreole.org]]

Be careful that italic links are rendered properly:  //[[http://my.book.example/|My Book Title]]// 

Free links without braces should be rendered as well, like http://www.wikicreole.org/ and http://www.wikicreole.org/users/~example. 

Creole1.0 specifies that http://bar and ftp://bar should not render italic,
something like foo://bar// should render as italic.
You can use this to draw a line to separate the page:

#   'margin' : '10px 2px 10px 5px;',
#   'title'  : 'Priestley Avenue side of the Joseph Priestley House in 2007',
# }

The Joseph Priestley House was the American home of 18th-century British
theologian, dissenting clergyman, natural philosopher, educator, and
political theorist Joseph Priestley from 1798 until his death in 1804.
Located in Northumberland, Pennsylvania, the house, which was designed by
Priestley's wife Mary, is Georgian with Federalist accents. The
''Pennsylvania Historical'' and ''Museum Commission'' has operated it as a museum
dedicated to Joseph Priestley since 1970, but may close it by July 2009
due to low visitation and budget cuts. 
* Fleeing religious persecution and political turmoil in Britain, the Priestleys emigrated to the United States in 1794 seeking a peaceful life.
* Hoping to avoid the political troubles that had plagued them in Britain and the problems of urban life they saw in the United States, the Priestleys built a house in rural Pennsylvania; nevertheless, political disputes and family troubles dogged Priestley during the last ten years of his life.
*In the 1960s, the house was carefully restored by the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission and designated a National Historic Landmark.
* A second renovation was undertaken in the 1990s to return the home to the way it looked during Priestley's time.
