Description: pypcapfile
        ==========
        
        pypcapfile is a pure Python library for handling libpcap savefiles. 
        
        The core  functionality is implemented in pcapfile.savefile:
        
        >>> from pcapfile import savefile
        >>> sf = savefile.load_savefile('test.pcap')
        [+] attempting to load test.pcap
        [+] found valid header
        [+] loaded 11 packets
        [+] finished loading savefile.
        >>> print sf
        big-endian capture file version 2.4
        snapshot length: 65535
        linklayer type: LINKTYPE_ETHERNET
        number of packets: 11
        >>>
        
        You can a look at the packets in sf.packets:
        >>> pkt = sf.packets[0]
        >>> p.raw()
        <binary data snipped>
        >>> p.timestamp
        1343676707L
        >>>
        
        This is still in a pre-release state.
        
        Future planned improvements:
        * Packet parsing (i.e. IP(pkt) or TCP(pkt)
        * improved Sphinx-based documentation
