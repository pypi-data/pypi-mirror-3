Future
------

- from compressed files
- to compressed files
- validator module based on csvvalidator
- show rows/values causing conversion or translation errors
- filldown
- fillup
- fillright? 
- fillleft?
- categorise/classify - convenient way to extend table with a classification field? or just use extend with function? example, convert continuous variable to categorical variable using custom ranges
- sampling for pivot, avoid two complete passes
- alpha facet?
- partitioning of alpha fields?
- code smells in reduce functions - refactor with generic grouper and reducer functions?
- code smells in hash join functions
- provenance trace
- petl.fluent
- implement rowgroupby? generate sequence of key/row iterator pairs?
- implement recordgroupby?
- optimised implementation of merge() where input files are presorted? I.e., avoid need to concatenate then sort the concatenation, rather just do the merge sort then reduce
