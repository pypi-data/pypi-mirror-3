Installation
============

Thanks to the liberal licensing of all third-party dependencies (pyyaml and
pexpect) I could re-package them into the grc namespace. This makes ``grc``
completely standalone. As a result you can safely install it into the system
(i.e. *without* using ``virtualenv``) without the risk of breaking other
packages.

As a consequence, installation is as easy as typing::

    pip install grc

or::

    easy_install grc
