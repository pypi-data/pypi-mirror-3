Description: Sauron is meant to act as an all-seeing eye for pushing data to monitoring. It
        works based on extendable "metrics", which are just python classes that report
        back values. For example, it comes with metrics to monitor disk space, mysql
        health, pinging servers, etc. These metrics are then pushed to "emitters" which
        describe where that data should go. Multiple emitters can be used, and are meant
        to be interchangeable.
