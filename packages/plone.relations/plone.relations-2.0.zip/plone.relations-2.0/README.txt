Based on the index and relationship container from zc.relationship by
Gary Poster from Zope Corporation, and the port of the Zope intid utility
to Zope 2 by Whit Morriss in five.intid. This package includes a slightly
modified version of ``container.txt`` from zc.relationship which is copyright
Zope Corporation and distributed under the ZPL. The package was mostly
inspired by ideas in the doctests of that product.
