"""Package of customizations of external libraries.

Package, module, class, and function overrides go here as necessary.  Anything
included here should either tweak an external library's behavior or fix a bug.
Bugfixes should make their way upstream, as should behavior tweaks if they are
general enough.  Use of this package allows for development and deployment
against release versions of external libraries.

Everything in this package follows the namespace of the origin library,
prefixed by 'tango.custom', e.g. customizations to example.Class end up at
tango.custom.example.Class.
