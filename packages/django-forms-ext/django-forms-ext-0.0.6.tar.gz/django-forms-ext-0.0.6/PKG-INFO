Description: 
        
        These are extensions for Django's forms.
        
        Currently this contains the following:
        
        Fields
        =========
        
        - ForeignKeyChoiceField
        
            When you have a formset that has a foreign key, Django will
            fire off a new (identical) query to build the choices for
            that field for each form in the formset by default. Using this
            field will allow you to run the query once for the choices and
            re-use that queryset for each form in the formset.
        
        - CommaSeparatedField
        
            Django has a comma separated integer field, but not just strings.
            Stupid, I know... we created one for use with strings
        
        - QuerysetChoiceField
        
            When you want to build a select box with a queryset but don't want
            a model instance when saving, use this thing.
        
        Views
        =========
        - FormSetView
        
            Django 1.3's generic views do not include a FormSet view. That's
            what this is.
