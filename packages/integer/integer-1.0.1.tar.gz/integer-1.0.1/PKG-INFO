Description: 
        This package provides utilities for creating custom integer types.
        
        Integer
        -------
        
        Inheriting directly from ``int`` type results in custom integer types where the results of operations are instances of ``int`` type. ::
        
            >>> class X(int): pass
            ... 
            >>> a = X(1)
            >>> x = a + 1
            >>> x
            2
            >>> x.__class__
            <type 'int'>
        
        ``Integer`` can be used as a base class for custom integer types that preserve the type when performing operations. ::
        
           >>> from integer import Integer
           >>> class X(Integer): pass
           ... 
           >>> a = X(1)
           >>> x = a + 1
           >>> x
           2
           >>> x.__class__
           <class '__main__.X'>
        
        Subclasses can override the finalize_values method in order to affect the final return value of operations whenever the int operation returns an int.
        
        enum
        ----
        
        ``enum`` can be used to declare an enumeration, which defines the enumeration type and its enumeration values in the globals of the calling module. ::
        
            >>> from integer.enum import enum
            >>> enum('RGB', RED=1, GREEN=2, BLUE=3, ALPHA=4)
            >>> RGB
            <class 'integer.enum.RGB'>
            >>> RED
            RED
            >>> int(RED)
            1
            >>> RGB(1)
            RED
            >>> RGB(1) is RED
            True
            >>> RED, GREEN, BLUE, ALPHA, RGB(5)
            (RED, GREEN, BLUE, ALPHA, RGB(5))
        
        The type defined by ``enum`` does not restrict the values that it can represent, it just provides a helpful string representation for the named values.
