Description: Requirements
        ============
        
        -  Python (tested on 2.6.2 and 2.6.4)
        -  `python-bitarray <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/bitarray/>`_
           (``pip install bitarray``)
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Linux
        -----
        
        You can use *pip* to get the package from the `Python Package
        Index <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/rapid-spring/>`_.
        
        ::
        
            pip install rapid-spring --upgrade
        
        Note: on some Linux distributions the script is called pip-python
        instead of just pip. The python-devel or python-dev package may be
        required to install bitarray.
        
        If you do not have the script *pip* available then use your
        distribution's package manager to install the python-pip (or similar)
        package.
        
        ::
        
            apt-get install python-pip   # Debian/Ubuntu
            yum install python-pip       # Fedora
        
        Windows
        -------
        
        As there is currently no binary package, go through the following steps
        to run rapid on Windows:
        
        -  Download and install `python
           2.6 <http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.6/>`_
        -  Download and install
           `setuptools <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools#files>`_ (for
           python 2.6!)
        -  Suppose you installed python in ``c:\python26``, make sure the PATH
           environment variable contains ``c:\python26`` and
           ``c:\python26\scripts``
        -  Open a console and run ``easy_install -U rapid-spring``
        -  Rapid is now installed! Continue reading to learn how to use rapid
           :-)
        
        Why python 2.6? Simple answer: bitarray binary packages are not
        available yet for python 2.7
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        ::
        
            rapid [options...] <verb>  [arguments...]
        
        Where the different verbs and their arguments are:
        
        -  ``upgrade``: Install the latest package for all pinned tags.
        -  ``clean-upgrade``: Equivalent to 'upgrade' followed by
           'uninstall-unpinned'.
        -  ``pin <tag(s)>``: Pins tags and installs the latest packages for
           those tags.
        -  ``unpin <tag(s)>``: Unpins tags. Does not uninstall any packages.
        -  ``install <package(s)>``: Install packages. Does not pin any tags.
        -  ``uninstall <package(s)>``: Uninstall packages. Unpins their tags if
           any.
        -  ``list-tags [tag]``: List all tags that match *tag*.
        -  ``list-pinned-tags [tag]``: Idem, but only pinned tags.
        -  ``list-packages [package]``: List all packages whose name contains
           *package*.
        -  ``list-installed-packages [package]``: Idem, but only installed
           packages.
        -  ``uninstall-unpinned``: Keep only the pinned tags and all
           dependencies.
        -  ``collect-pool``: Remove pool files not needed by any installed
           package.
        -  ``make-sdd <tag|package> <dir>``: Extract pool files of a package
           into ``~/.spring/mods/<dir>``.
        
        Examples:
        ---------
        
        ::
        
            rapid pin xta:latest   # installs latest XTA
            rapid pin s44:latest   # installs latest Spring: 1944
            rapid upgrade          # upgrade all pinned tags
        
        Other commands are for power users mostly, e.g.:
        
        ::
        
            rapid list-tags '^(?!ba).*:(latest|stable|test)$' --regex
        
        This displays all tags ending with ':latest', ':stable' or ':test',
        which do not start with the string 'ba'.
        
        Options:
        --------
        
        -  -h, --help show this help message and exit
        -  --datadir=DATADIR Override the default data directory. (~/.spring on
           Linux or the one reported by unitsync on Windows)
        -  --unitsync Use unitsync to locate the data directory Spring uses.
        -  --no-unitsync Do not use unitsync.
        -  -r, --regex Use regular expressions instead of substring matches for
           pin, unpin, install, uninstall and all list-\* commands.
        -  -y, --yes Answer all confirmations with yes. MAY BE DANGEROUS!
        
        Bugs/quirks
        ===========
        
        -  ``~/.spring/packages`` isn't scanned. This means that packages which
           have been installed using a different tool (e.g.
           SpringDownloader.exe) and were removed from the server (I don't think
           that ever happens now) before rapid was ever started, will not be
           picked up by rapid. As such, they can not be uninstalled, don't
           appear in listings, and collect-gc may even break them by removing
           their pool files.
        
        -  unitsync is noisy on standard output. This should be fixed in
           unitsync however, and not worked around in rapid.
        
        -  unitsync insists on scanning all maps and mods while we only want to
           know the location of the data directory. This should also be fixed in
           unitsync.
        
        Please file any other bugs you find on `the issue
        tracker <http://github.com/tvo/rapid/issues>`_.
        
        Feature suggestions
        ===================
        
        -  make-sdz command (similar to make-sdd) could be useful
        -  Improve the GUI (``rapid-gui``)
        -  Add GUI progressbar, even for the commandline script (may be useful
           when integrating it in another app)
        -  Machine friendly progressbar, so other apps can parse it and render
           their own progressbar
