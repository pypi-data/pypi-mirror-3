        Introduction
        ============
        
        CodeMirror is a JavaScript library that provides features commonly found in IDEs
        (like syntax highlighting and smart indent) to browser-based editors.
        This product monkey patches Zope PythonScript ZMI edit form to use CodeMirror.
        It was tested in Chrome, Firefox and IE 9.
        
        Aim
        ===
        
        This product exists as a proposal of a feature addition to Zope itself: the author
        thinks textareas are too uncomfortable for developers to edit their code.
        
        Extending
        =========
        
        Including the file ++resource++codemirror/convertTextAreas.js all textareas with
        class codemirror-python will be converted.
        If an attribute called onCodeMirrorLoad is found on the textarea DOM element,
        it will be called with the codeMirror object as parameter.
