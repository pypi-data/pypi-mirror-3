.TH bastioncrypto 1 "Mar 29, 2005" "BastionCrypto External Helper"
.SH NAME
.B bastioncrypto
\- helper application that handles the interaction between the
Zope BastionCrypto product and the client side gpg program

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B This program is intended to be called by the web browser in response
to the application/x-bastioncrypto MIME type, and is not meant to be 
called directly by the user except for debugging or testing purposes.

.SH DESCRIPTION
Most web browsers should respect the MIME handling instructions in
the /etc/mailcap metamail capabilities file, where an entry should
have automatically been placed by the system to let bastioncrypto handle
the application/x-bastioncrypto MIME type.

However, if your web browser does not respect mailcap, or if it was
not automatically updated during installation, you can simply specify

bastioncrypto essentially asks you for your passphrase to unlock your
private key so that the website's cryptographic requests can be
easily performed on your machine.  It is not otherwise able to perform
these operations as the server does not have access to your private key
and nor should it.
  
.B /usr/bin/bastioncrypto

as a new helper application in your web browser of choice to handle
downloads of MIME type

.B application/x-bastioncrypto

for you to be able to automagically respond to BastionCrypto client 
side requests.
