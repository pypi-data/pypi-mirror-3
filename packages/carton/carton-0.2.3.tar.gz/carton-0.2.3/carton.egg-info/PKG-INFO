Description: 
        make a self-extracting virtualenv from directories or URLs of packages
        
        To package up all files in a virtualenvs source directory (e.g.)::
        
          python path/to/carton.py myproject project/src/*
        
        This will create a self-extracting file, `myproject.py`, that will unfold
        a virtualenv with the specified packages setup for development
        
        The sources may be directories, local or HTTP-accessible tarballs, or ordinary
        files. The `setup.py`s found in the `src` directory after extraction will be
        run (via `python setup.py develop`) in the order they are provided. This makes
        it possible to have completely local dependencies (without touching the net)
        by correctly specifying the source order.  If a `setup.py` is overwritten from
        a later source, it will not be rerun (known limitation).
        
        The extracted virtualenv will be created in the current directory and will have
        the same name as provided initially (e.g. `myproject`) unless `--env` is
        specified.
        
        Normally, the entire contents of source directories are compressed and
        packaged as-is.  When running with the `--package` flag, a source tarball is
        produced via `python setup.py sdist` if the directory contains a top-level
        `setup.py`.
        
        Since directories are compressed as-is, portable file-based VCS repositories,
        such a mercurial and git, may be cartoned this way (though note that newer
        repositories may not be backwards-compatible with older clients).
