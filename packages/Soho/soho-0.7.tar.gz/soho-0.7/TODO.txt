To do
=====

- in documentation, s/you/we

- add tests

- complete tutorial

- find a way to patch Pygments (if possible) so that it generates
  different CSS classes depending on the lexer (e.g. ".python-c"
  instead of ".c"). We could therefore use multiple CSS files and they
  would not override each others.

- find a way to show more information when there is an error in the
  template. For now, the error is not precise at all (it should at
  least include the line number where the error occurs). Check the
  version of ``zope.pagetemplate`` et al.

- multilingual content: would be nice to build a multilingual web site
  from a set of multilingual source files ('foo.en.txt', 'foo.fr.txt',
  etc.), using Apache "content negotiation" feature (see
  http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/en/content-negotiation.html and
  http://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-apache-lang-neg). We
  also have to take care of the navigation (and, more generally, all
  bindings): perhaps the language could be an attribute of the
  'Context' object.

- make appropriate changes to ``checkimages.py``
