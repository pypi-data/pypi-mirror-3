                                       Bug Repo Syncer
        ===============================================================================
        
        *Bug Repo Syncer* is a command line program to synchronize bug repositories. It
        currently works with Launchpad and Trac. It can in principle also be used to
        migrate between these repositories. The main motivation to write this program,
        is the lack of a Mylyn connector for Launchpad, while there exists a Mylyn
        connector for Trac.
        
        The program synchronizes its own bug trackers: the project's bugs on Launchpad
        with a Trac site on Sourceforge. 
        
        https://bugs.launchpad.net/bug-repo-syncer
        
        http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/bug-repo-syncer/report/6
        
        *Bug Repo Syncer* is licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL) 
        Version 3.
        
        
        Deficiencies
        ===============================================================================
        
        The program is currently incomplete. Also the approach to translate between
        repositories with significantly different concepts, has inherent drawbacks.
        
        * *Bug Repo Syncer* does not synchronize bug comments.
        
        * Bug status values (status, priority, resolution, type) can only be roughly
          translated between repositories of different type. *Bug Repo Syncer* uses
          internally a fairly simple model, that is quite similar to the way how Trac
          works. When *Bug Repo Syncer* changes a bug, the status values are set in
          accordance with this simple model. This way information is lost, especially
          from Launchpad's fairly fine grained model.
        
        
        Dependencies
        ===============================================================================
        
        The program is developed on Linux. It uses however nothing Linux specific,
        and may therefore work on other Unix-like operating systems such as Mac OS X. 
        
        The following software is required to run *Bug Repo Syncer*:
        
        **Python**
            An installation of the Python programming language.
        
        **diff3**
            A command line program to merge text. Present on nearly all Linux and Unix
            installations.
        
        **Dateutil**
            A Python library to process dates. Usually installed on Linux by default.
            
        **Launchpadlib**
            A library to access launchpad from Python programs.
            Install it with:: 
        
                pip install launchpadlib
        
        
        Installation
        ===============================================================================
        
        Open a shell window and type::
        
            pip install bug-repo-syncer
        
        Alternatively download the source archive, extract it, change into the
        extracted directory, and type the familiar::
        
            python setup.py install
        
        
        Operation
        ===============================================================================
        
        *Bug Repo Syncer* has the notion of a *project directory*, where configuration
        and data files are stored. For normal operation it is assumed that the user 
        changes into the project directory and types the synchronization command(s).
        
        Synchronization commands are executed with the ``bsync`` program, it uses
        sub-commands like Bazaar's ``bzr`` program.
        
        General Options
        ---------------
        
        The general options precede the sub-commands. For example, synchronize and
        specify the project directory explicitly::
        
            bsync --project-dir path/to/project/dir sync
        
        -h, --help            
            Show a help message and exit.
        
        --project-dir DIRECTORY
            Specify the directory with configuration and data files.
        
        (Sub-) Commands
        ---------------
        
        All sub-commands have their own option ``--help``, that shows a specific help
        message. To get the help message for the sub-command ``sync`` for example, type::
        
            bsync sync --help
        
        ``init``
        ........
        
        Create a configuration file in the current directory. The generated
        configuration file must be edited, so that it refers to your bug repositories.
        To invoke the sub-command type::
        
            bsync init
        
        ``info``                
        ........
        
        Show status of project directory. ::
        
            bsync info
        
        
        ``sync``                
        ........
        
        Synchronize the repositories. ::
        
            bsync sync
        
        This sub-command has further options:
        
        --since DATE_TIME  
            Consider changes since this date (and time).
        
        
        Bug Reports and Hacking 
        ===============================================================================
        
        Bugs reports should be filed in the project's bug tracker on Launchpad. They
        can in principle also be filed at the Trac site, as both sites are
        synchronized. (Information on Trac is however treated with less care, as Trac
        is seen as the secondary site.)
        
        https://launchpad.net/bug-repo-syncer
        
        The program is written in the Python programming language. Development is
        coordinated on Launchpad, Bazaar is the version control system, the developer
        uses Eclipse and Vim to edit the program text. The Trac site lets the
        developers see the bugs in the Mylyn component Eclipse.
