# In order for Dabo to 'see' classes in your reports directory, add an 
# import statement here for each class. E.g., if you have a file named
# 'MyClasses.py' in this directory, and it defines two classes named 'FirstClass'
# and 'SecondClass', add these lines:
# 
# from MyClass import FirstClass
# from MyClass import SecondClass
# 
# Now you can refer to these classes as: self.Application.reports.FirstClass and
# self.Application.reports.SecondClass
