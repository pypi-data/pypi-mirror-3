Description: Quicktime/MP4 Fast Start
        ------------------------
        Enable streaming and pseudo-streaming of Quicktime and MP4 files by
        moving metadata and offset information to the front of the file.
        
        This program is based on qt-faststart.c from the ffmpeg project, which is
        released into the public domain, as well as ISO 14496-12:2005 (the official
        spec for MP4), which can be obtained from the ISO or found online.
        
        The goals of this project are to run anywhere without compilation (in
        particular, many Windows and Mac OS X users have trouble getting
        qt-faststart.c compiled), to run about as fast as the C version, to be more
        user friendly, and to use less actual lines of code doing so.
        
        Features
        --------
        
            * Works everywhere Python can be installed
            * Handles both 32-bit (stco) and 64-bit (co64) atoms
            * Handles any file where the mdat atom is before the moov atom
            * Preserves the order of other atoms
            * Can replace the original file (if given no output file)
        
        Installing from PyPi
        --------------------
        
        To install from PyPi, you may use easy_install or pip::
        
            easy_install qtfaststart
        
        Installing from source
        ----------------------
        
        Download a copy of the source, ``cd`` into the top-level
        ``qtfaststart`` directory, and run::
        
            python setup.py install
        
        If you are installing to your system Python (instead of a virtualenv), you
        may need root access (via ``sudo`` or ``su``).
        
        Usage
        -----
        See ``qt-faststart.py --help`` for more info! If outfile is not present then
        the infile is overwritten.
        
            $ qtfaststart.py infile [outfile]
