Introduction

Installation

The ts2avi script is shipped as a distutils package. To install
the library, unpack the distribution archive, and issue the following
command:

    $ python setup.py install

If you want to have a *local* installation of the script, or 
equivalently if you don't have root access for installing 
site-packages, you may want to make benefit from the new 'user'
option which is provided by recent versions of distutils:

    $ python setup.py install --user

This will install everything in your $HOME/.local directory for 
POSIX users. Don't forget to add your $HOME/.local/bin to your
path for instance in you .bashrc source bash configuration file.
