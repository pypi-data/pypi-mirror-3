Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This is an add-on for Plone to provide some content management metadata
        essentials.
        
        Even if they are several fields, they complement each other to build a set of
        useful features for managing and maintaining websites.
        
        Responsible person
        ------------------
        
        It may come as a surprise to some that we don't have this in Plone already. We
        store and index the creator of content (a mostly useless value) and we manage an
        owner role on content, a permission rule not indexed for practical use. The
        responsible person is the person that owns the content and is responsible for
        keeping it updated.
        
        Validity date
        -------------
        
        The expiry date field in Plone is not very useful and not often used beyond
        checkboxes in feature comparisons. This field, the validity date, is more
        useful: It is always set when saving an object (like the versioning note) from a
        vocabulary of dates in the future (1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year
        from now). Whenever the object is saved, the date is set in the future.
        
        When the date approaches, the responsible person will be notified that his
        content is about to expire. It will also be visible in her review lists. For
        updating it, all she needs to do is to open the content and save it again,
        effectively setting the expiry date some time in the future. If the content does
        expire, it will, according to site policy, either be archived/made
        unavailable/hidden, or visibly marked as obsolete/unmaintained.
        
        Views and actions needed
        ------------------------
        
        * My content
            a screen of content i am responsible for and its status
            Perhaps batch operations on it
            perhaps batch assign to someone else
        
        * New document byline
            the responsible person, not the creator
            alternatively a portlet with a photo and contact details of the responsible person
        
        * a new ownership form which sets this field along with the owner role
        
        * a global change ownership form for when you delete/deactivate users.
