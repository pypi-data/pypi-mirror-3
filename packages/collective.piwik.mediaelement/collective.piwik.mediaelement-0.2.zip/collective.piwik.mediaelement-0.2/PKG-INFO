Description: Introduction
        ============
        collective.piwik.mediaelement displays a video play counter for Plone sites that use collective.mediaelementjs (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/collective.mediaelementjs).
        A download counter is displayed when used in combination with collective.transcode.star (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/collective.transcode.star) or Plumi (http://plumi.org).
        
        Usage data is stored and retrieved by Piwik (http://piwik.org), an open source analytics platform.
        
        How to get it working
        =====================
        
        - Install collective.piwik.core and collective.mediaelementjs from the Plone control panel.
        - You need to have access to a working Piwik installation. Create a new site in the Piwik admin UI and a new user who should have view access for that site.
        - Go to the Piwik Settings page in the Plone control panel and enter the URL of your Piwik instance, the siteId and the user's authentication token
        - Upload a video that can be played by mediaelementjs and click play
        
        If you do the above a viewlet should appear on top of mediaelementjs displaying the number of views of each video.
