Description: ===========
        OplogReplay
        ===========
        
        OplogReplay provides a simple tool that can replay MongoDB oplogs from one
        cluster to another. Useful for admin operations, or to keep multiple copies
        of the same data in different mongo clusters.
        
        The included bin/oplogreplay script should cover most of the usecases::
        
            oplogreplay source:27017 destination:27017 --logpath=oplogreplay.log
        
        (see oplogreplay --help for more details)
        
        Installing
        ==========
        
        Installing is as easy as::
        
            pip install oplogreplay
        
        Advanced usage
        ==============
        
        The package contains only two classes:
         * OplogWatcher
         * OplogReplayer
        
        More advanced use-cases can be achieved by extending the OplogReplayer (e.g.:
        you can choose to skip replaying deletes, or modify the operations before
        replaying them into the destination cluster, etc.).
