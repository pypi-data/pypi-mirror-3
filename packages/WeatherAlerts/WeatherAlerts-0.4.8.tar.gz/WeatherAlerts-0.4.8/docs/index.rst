WeatherAlerts Docs
**********************

.. Note::
   This documentation is a work in progress, I hope to have it completed by the 1.0 release of WeatherAlerts.


Welcome!
==========
WeatherAlerts is a python project I started in Nov 2011 as part of another weather/python project I was working on. 
I wanted to create a python module to interact with the Emergency Alerts data provided free from the 
National Weather Service, rather than have to sign up and potentially pay a 3rd party to give me access to this data. 
Please take a look through the documentation here, if you still have questions, contact me.
