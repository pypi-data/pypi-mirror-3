Description: xdv.inventions ver 1.0
        ----------------------
        
        xdv.inventions is a plone look and feel customization using collective.xdv.
        
        Dependencies
        ------------
        Plone 3.3rc5 or bigger. Tested with Plone 4.0b5.
        xdv.inventions depends on collective.xdv To setup collective.xdv you can follow its instructions at `package's page <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/collective.xdv/>`_.
        
        Setup
        -----
        1. Add collective.xdv and install it on your plone site using quickinstaller.
        
        2. Add xdvtheme.inventions to your buildout::
        
            [buildout]
            ... 
            eggs =
                ... 
                collective.inventions
        
            [instance]
            ... 
            zcml =
                collective.inventions
        
        
        
        3. Rerun buildout and restart your Plone instance.
        
        4. Go to site setup, Theme transform, and fill the xdv form enabling it and to use the static resources. For example:
        
            Enabled: yes
            Domains: www.mysite.com:port
            Theme template: http://xxx.xx.xx.xxx:port/demo/static/index
            Rules file: /absolute_path_to_instance/themes/rules.xml
        
        where www.mysite.com are the domains which you're going to use to access the site, http://xxx.xx.xx.xxx is the ip number of the site, or a file system path in your server to reach the file index.html. Click on save and if you access using www.mysite.com you should get the inventions look and feel customization.
        
        If you're trying it locally, it could be something like:
        
            Domains: localhost:8080
            Theme template: http://127.0.0.1:8080/MY-PLONE-SITE/index
            Rules file: /PATH-TO-BOULDOUT-EGGS/xdvtheme.inventions/rules.xml
