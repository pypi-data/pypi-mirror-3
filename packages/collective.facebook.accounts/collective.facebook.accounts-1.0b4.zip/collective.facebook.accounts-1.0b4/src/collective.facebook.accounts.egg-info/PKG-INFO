        Life, the Universe, and Everything
        ----------------------------------
        
        This package allows you to associate `Facebook`_ accounts with a Plone site
        using `OAuth`_ authentication.
        
        Facebook accounts are added to the Plone site using a Facebook app. You can
        create your own from Facebook's `App Dashboard`_. Make sure to write down the
        app's "App ID/API Key".
        
        Don't Panic
        -----------
        
        - Go to the "Site Setup", then to the "Facebook" tool.
        - Choose from the "Permissions" section, which permissions you'll need to use.
          You can get further info on each one, from the `Permissions Reference`_
        - Write the "App ID/API Key" from your Facebook app (see prerequisites).
        - Click on "Request user auth"
        - If your browser asks to, click on "Leave this page".
        - Login with the Facebook account you want to use.
        - Allow permission for the app.
        
        Done, you should now be back at your Plone site, and see your account listed
        in the "Accounts" section in the tool.
        
        An expiration date is included too.
        
        If you want to remove an account, simply click on its red cross next to its
        name. Be carefull, it will delete the account without confirmation, and it
        cannot be undone.
        
        Applications
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        If you want to authorize your application to access the Facebook API,
        for instance to show a portlet with a user's Wall, you can do just that:
        
        - Go to the "Site Setup", then to the "Facebook" tool.
        - Enter the "App/ID/API Key" and "App Secret" in the "Authorize new app"
          section.
        - Click on "Authenticate app".
        
        You should now see your application listed in the "Accounts" section.
        
        Actually posting or getting to/from Facebook
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        This product just saves the needed data in order to use the Facebook API.
        You'll need additional products in order to do so, for example
        `collective.facebook.portlets`_.
