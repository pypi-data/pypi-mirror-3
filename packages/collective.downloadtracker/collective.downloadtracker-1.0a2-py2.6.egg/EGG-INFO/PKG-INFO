Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        collective.downloadtracker is a simple Plone add-on. It tracks who has 
        downloaded when the file attachment. It displays this value in a viewlet below 
        File's title.
        Administrators are able to delete tracked records.
        
        
        Installing
        ==========
        
        This package requires Plone 4.0 or later (tested on 4.1.2).
        
        Installing without buildout
        ---------------------------
        
        Install this package in either your system path packages or in the lib/python
        directory of your Zope instance. You can do this using either easy_install or
        via the setup.py script.
        
        Installing with buildout
        ------------------------
        
        If you are using `buildout` to manage your instance installing
        collective.downloadtracker is even simpler. You can install
        collective.downloadtracker by adding it to the eggs line for your instance::
        
            [instance]
            eggs = collective.downloadtracker
        
        After updating the configuration you need to run the ''bin/buildout'', which
        will take care of updating your system.
        
        Go to the 'Site Setup' page in the Plone interface and click on the 'Add/Remove Products' link.
        
        Choose the product (check its checkbox) and click the 'Install' button.
