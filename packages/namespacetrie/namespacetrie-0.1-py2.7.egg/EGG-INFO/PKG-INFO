Description: This is the Namesapce Trie.
        
        Namespace Trie is a implementation of a Trie data structure.  Unlike typical
        implementations, which are splitting its value into single characters,
        Namespace Trie treats its values as namespaces.  Namespaces are strings that
        are delimited by a period. Such namespaces often occur in programming
        languages, e.g. Java or Python and may also appear while using some libraries
        for programming languages that itself do not offer namespacing (e.g. the
        Google Closure library offers a namespace feature for JavaScript).  The
        Namespace Trie may help you find flaws in the namespace structure.
        
        Namespace Trie is developed for use with Closure Depresolver and may at the
        moment not be very useful as there is not standalone interface.
