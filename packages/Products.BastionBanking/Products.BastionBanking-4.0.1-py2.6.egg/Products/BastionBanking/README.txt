onto your PYTHONPATH.  In addition, there is a Products.BastionBanking.ZCurrency 
module, which is an extension to support currencies in Zope, along with Archetype 
widgets, a Currency ZCatalog index and other features.

There are also a range of pluggable merchant payment gateways and skins which support
e-commerce/shopping carts/payment management.
