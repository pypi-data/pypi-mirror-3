Introduction
============

This product replaces all archetype time inputs with radial (also
known as circular or pie) menues.


The time drop down is a pita, a radial menu saves a lot of mouse moves.
The radial menu is easy to grasp after all the display is pretty much
the same as an analogue clock.

The js is short (~4.3k uncompressed) and no changes to the current
time input is required. It is fully customizable with css, very few
assumption are made in the code.
It falls back to the 'classic' drop down menus on browsers w/o js.

It implements Fitts’ law, which…

[...] is a model of human movement primarily used in human–computer
interaction and ergonomics that predicts that the time required to
rapidly move to a target area is a function of the distance to the
target and the size of the target.- Wikipedia
