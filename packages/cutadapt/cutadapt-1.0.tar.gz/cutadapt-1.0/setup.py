# Aims for the package layout
#
# - The name of the program must be 'cutadapt'.
# - It must be possible to run cutadapt without installing the package, preferably
#   by typing ./cutadapt or something like ./scripts/cutadapt or ./bin/cutadapt.
# - Use a separate package for the additional modules, don't clutter the global
#   namespace.
# - Not too many nested directories.
# - The main program should (mostly) be an example for how to use the package.
