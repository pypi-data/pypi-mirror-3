This is a Python library to access the [Github API v3](http://developer.github.com/v3).

With it, you can manage your [Github](http://github.com) resources (repositories, user profiles, organizations, etc.) from Python scripts.

It covers the **full** API, and all methods are tested against the real Github site.

Should you have any question, or if you find a bug, or if there is something you can do with the API but not with PyGithub, please [open an issue](https://github.com/jacquev6/PyGithub/issues).

News (on June 3rd, 2012)
========================

Version 1.0 is out! You can now consider PyGithub stable. I will maintain it up to date with the API, and fix bugs if any, but I don't plan new heavy developments.

Download and install
====================

This package is in the [Python Package Index](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyGithub), so `easy_install PyGithub` or `pip install PyGithub` should be enough.
You can also clone it on [Github](http://github.com/jacquev6/PyGithub).

Tutorial
========

First create a Gihub instance:

    from github import Github

    g = Github( "user", "password" )

Then play with your Github objects:

    for repo in g.get_user().get_repos():
        print repo.name
        repo.edit( has_wiki = False )

You can also create a Github instance with an OAuth token:

    g = Github( token )

Or without authentication:

    g = Github()
