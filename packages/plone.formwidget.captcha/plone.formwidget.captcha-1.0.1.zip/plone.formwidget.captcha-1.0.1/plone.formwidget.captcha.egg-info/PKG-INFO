        Buildout Installation
        ---------------------
        
        Add the following code to your buildout.cfg to install plone.formwidget.captcha::
        
            [buildout]
            ...
            eggs =
                ...
                plone.formwidget.captcha
                ...
        
            ...
            [instance]
            ...
            zcml =
                ...
                plone.formwidget.captcha
            ...
        
        
        Captchas without server state
        -----------------------------
        
        (From collective.captcha)
        
        A view to generate a captcha image and/or wav file, and to verify user input
        against it.
        
        A cookie is used to transfer state from one request to the next. The state is
        used, together with a server-side secret, to create a random string of
        characters, which in turn is displayed as a captcha image, or transformed to
        an audio file. Verification happens case-insensitively.
        
        Note that the captcha 'word' is only usable for 5-10 minutes, after which the
        view will not accept it any more. Moreover, a different word will be generated
        for a given session key every 5 minutes.
        
        This makes these captchas replayable for up to 10 minutes if a determined
        user keeps sending the same session id. Because of the server-secret though,
        captchas are not transferrable between sites.
        
        Changelog
        =========

        ------------------
        
        * Use widgets view class attributes in the template.
          [romanofski]
        
        
        1.0 (2011-06-29)
        ----------------
        
        * Use hashlib module by default.
          [thomasdesvenain]
        
        * Zope 2.13 imports (removes warnings under Plone 4.1)
          [thomasdesvenain]
        
        1.0b2 - 2010-09-02
        ------------------
        
        * Specify allowed_attributes for the captcha view, so the image/audio pages
          are accessible in Zope 2.12.9+.
          [hannosch]
        
        * Move to plone.app.discussion-captcha feature declaration to meta.zcml.
          [timo]
        
        * Fix verify method for empty string input values. This is necessary for
          plone.app.discussion 1.0b5 compatibility.
          [timo]
        
        1.0b1 - 2010-06-02
        ------------------
        
        * Fix _generate_words method. The "nowish" variable tells us in which 5 minutes
          slot we are in. Therefore we increment the time slot by 1, not by 5 (minutes).
          [tbesluau]
        
        * Declare that plone.formwidget.captcha provides a Captcha field that can be
          used by plone.app.discussion to add a Captcha field to comment forms.
