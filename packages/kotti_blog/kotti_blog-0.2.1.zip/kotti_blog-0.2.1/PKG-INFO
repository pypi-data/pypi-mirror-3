Description: Blog addon for Kotti.
        
        ==========
        kotti_blog
        ==========
        
        This is an extension to the Kotti CMS that adds a simple blog system to your site.

        Setting up kotti_blog
        =====================
        
        This Addon adds two new Content Types to your Kotti site.
        To set up the content types add ``kotti_blog.kotti_configure``
        to the ``kotti.configurators`` setting in your ini file::
        
            kotti.configurators = kotti_blog.kotti_configure
        
        Now you can create a blog and add blog entries to your blog.
        
        There are different settings to adjust the behavior of the
        blog.
        
        You can select if the blog entries in the overview should
        be batched. If you set ``kotti_blog.blog_settings.use_batching``
        to ``true`` (the default value) the blog entries will be shown
        on seperated pages. If you set it to ``false`` all blog entries
        are shown all together on one page::
        
            kotti_blog.blog_settings.use_batching = false
        
        If you use batching you can choose how many blog entries are
        shown on one page. The default value for 
        ``kotti_blog.blog_settings.pagesize`` is 5::
        
            kotti_blog.blog_settings.pagesize = 10
        
        You can use auto batching where the next page of the blog entries
        is automatically loaded when scrolling down the overview page instead
        of showing links to switch the pages. The default for
        ``kotti_blog.blog_settings.use_auto_batching`` is ``true``::
        
            kotti_blog.blog_settings.use_auto_batching = false
        
        With ``kotti_blog.blog_settings.link_headline_overview`` you can control
        wether the headline of a blog entry in the overview is linked to the blog 
        entry or not. This setting defaults to ``true``::
        
            kotti_blog.blog_settings.link_headline_overview = false
        
        Parts of kotti_blog can be overridden with the setting
        ``kotti_blog.asset_overrides``. Have a look to the 
        `Kotti documentation about the asset_overrides setting`_, which is the same
        as in ``kotti_blog``.
