Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        ``jarn.xmpp.twisted`` provides a basis for building XMPP applications with Plone.
        
        In short, ``jarn.xmpp.twisted`` includes:
        
        * Extensions to the `wokkel`_ package by implementing parts of the following XMPP extensions:
        
          * `XEP-0071`_ XHTML-IM.
          * `XEP-0144`_ Roster Item Exchange.
          * `XEP-0060`_ Publish-Subscribe.
          * `XEP-0248`_ PubSub Collection Nodes.
          * `XEP-0133`_ Service Administration.
        
        * A `Twisted`_ reactor that runs side-by-side with the Zope instance.
        * Utilities that provide XMPP clients of two sorts, a *deferred* client that initially connects, executes a task and disconnects as soon as it is done, as well as a normal client that remains connected and can respond to XMPP events.
        * An XMPP component base class for writing custom components.
        
        ``jarn.xmpp.twisted`` is part of a suite, with the other packages being:
        
        * `jarn.xmpp.core`_, provides facilities for presence, messaging, chatting and microblogging.
        * `jarn.xmpp.collaboration`_ provides an XMPP protocol to do real-time collaborative editing as well as a Plone-targeted implementation.
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        ``jarn.xmpp.twisted`` requires a working XMPP server installation. Please refer to the `jarn.xmpp.core`_ documentation on how to set it up.
        
        Testing
        =======
        
        Some of the included tests are functional tests that require a XMPP server running on ``localhost`` as well as an administrator account setup up on this server with JID ``admin@localhost`` and password ``admin``. If you wish to run those you have to specify a *level* 2 on your testrunner, i.e.
        
            ::
        
            ./bin/test -a 2 -s jarn.xmpp.twisted
        
        Credits
        =======
        
        * Most of this work was done using the 10% time available to `Jarn AS`_ employees for the development of open-source projects.
