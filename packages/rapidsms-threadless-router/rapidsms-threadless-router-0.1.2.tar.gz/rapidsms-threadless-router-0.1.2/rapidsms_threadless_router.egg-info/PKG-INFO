Description: rapidsms-threadless-router
        ==========================
        
        A `RapidSMS <https://github.com/rapidsms/rapidsms>`_ router implementation that
        removes the threading functionality from the legacy Router class.  Rather, all
        inbound requests are handled via the main HTTP thread.  Backends can optionally
        pass requests to a message queue for out-of-band responses.
        ``threadless_router`` attempts to:
        
        * Make RapidSMS backends more Django-like.  Use Django's URL routing and views to handle inbound HTTP requests.
        * Remove clutter and complexity of route process and threaded backends.
        * Ease testing -- no more ``threading`` or ``Queue`` modules slowing down tests.
        
        Please refer to the `documentation <http://rapidsms-threadless-router.readthedocs.org/>`_ for more details.
