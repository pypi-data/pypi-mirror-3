Description: Collection by Subject Portlet
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        Concept - David Bain (david.bain@alteroo.com)
        Implemented by Rok Garbas (big ups to Rok).
        
        Introduction
        ============
        
        This portlet makes it possible to present collections grouped by different criteria including:
        
        * by Author
        * by Keyword
        * by Type
        * by Location (may require some tweaking)
        
        Usage
        =========
        Click "manage portlets" and add a new "Collection by subject".
        
        Settings include:
        
        Portlet header - the title of the portlet
        Target collection - the collection that the portlet will use
        Group by - the subject that you would like to group the items by
        Cache duration - the lenghth of time the results should be cached
        
        The output looks similar to this::
        
              by Keyword
        
                food (4)
                green (2)
                drink (4)
                well (2)
                sleep (1)
