Merge and Simplify Scripts (MASS)
=================================

Inspired by SASS, MASS is an automated tool for managing javascript
files in a web projects.

Goals
~~~~~

-  easy method to combine multiple files into single asset request
-  automated minification/optimization
-  extending javascript to allow import other scripts

Requirements
------------

-  Mac OS X (currently using fsevents to track file changes. will later
   add support for Linux and Windows)

Python Packages Used
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  jsmin (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/jsmin)
-  macfsevents (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/MacFSEvents/0.2.1)
-  virtualenv (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv)
-  argparse (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/argparse)

Installation
------------

MASS can be installed via pip:

::

    pip install mass

To install MASS manually, clone the repo and install using setup.py:

::

    python setup.py install

MASS comes with the necessary python packages via virutalenv by default.

Before installing MASS, users can enable virtualenv by navigating to the
repository and sourcing the virtual environment.

::

    cd path/to/MASS
    source env/bin/activate

Source Files
------------

Source files use the extension ’.xjs’, which tentatively signifies
extended javascript. These files are used to define javascript files
which will be included in a “compiled” version that is output by MASS.

Including Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Inside ‘extended’ javascript files, you can import other scripts. All
javascript files listed in the source file will be combined, minified
and output to a javascript file with the same name as the original xjs
file. Paths to imported javascript files should be relative to the
directory of the xjs file they are imported into.

The example below specifies two javascript files and will be output to
the file foo.min.js:

::

    # foo.xjs
    #!import foo.js
    #!import plugins/jquery.jnotify.js

Require commands can be used to ensure that a file has been already been
imported, and will import the script if they have not.

::

    # foo.xjs
    #!import foo.js
    #!import bar.js

    # foo.js
    #!require bar.js 

In the above example, bar.js will not be re-imported since foo.xjs has
already imported it.

MASS also supports ‘inline’ javascript

::

    # bar.js
    #!import foo.js

    # now some javascript 
    $(document).ready(function(){
        // jquery is ready
    });

    # another import!
    #!import plugins/jquery.jnotify.js

CLI Arguments
-------------

Basic Commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Mass has two basic CLI commands, ``watch`` and ``compile``. ``watch``
begins monitoring the specified directory and will compile files as they
are edited while ``compile`` will simply minify and combine files
located in the specified directory.

::

    mass watch -s path/to/source

    mass compile -s path/to/source

Defining Destination Directory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, MASS saves the compiled js files in the same directory as
the source files. The -d argument can be used to specify a different
output directory.

::

    mass watch -d path/to/output

Defining Source Directory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If a source directory is not specified, MASS uses the current directory
by default. The -s argument can be used to specify the directory for
MASS to discover files.

::

    mass watch -s path/to/source -d path/to/output
