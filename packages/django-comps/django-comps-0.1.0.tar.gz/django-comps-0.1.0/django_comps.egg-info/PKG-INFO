        ==========================
        
        An app that facilitates rapid prototyping.
        
        Provides an entry point for deeper integration of naive-to-Django front end designers into a project.
        
        Install
        -------
        
        ``pip install django-comps``
        
        Add ``comps`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS``
        
        Configure the path to your ``COMPS_DIR``
        
        ```
        #Designate the folder for comp/design work
        COMPS_DIR = '/path/to/project/templates/comps'
        ```
        
        Configure **urls.py**
        
        ```
        if 'comps' in settings.INSTALLED_APPS:
            urlpatterns += patterns('', url(r'^', include('comps.urls')))
        ```
        
        Usage
        -------
        Protypes can be built in the ``COMPS-DIR`` and render within he context of
        a Django project, without the need for defined views.
        
        * Take advantage of the templating engine
        * No need to pre-configure urls and views during prototyping
        * Onboard new designers to the wonders of Django
        
        Plumbing
        --------
        
        * ``/comps`` renders a list of ** *.html ** files and directories located within the ``COMPS_DIR``
        * ``/comp/*.html`` renders the template in question.
