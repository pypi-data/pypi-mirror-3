Description: Wheelwright
        ===========
        
        Wheelwright helps you build, repair, or maintain bicycle wheels by
        easily visualizing the tension of each spoke in relation to the target
        tension desired for the rim.
        
        Features
        --------
        
        * Visualizes spoke tension, quickly showing whether the wheel is
          within spec
        * Converts deflection readings from Park Tool's TM-1 tension meter to
          kilograms of force (kgf) --- support for other tension meters is
          planned for future releases
        * Outputs a pretty report of the wheel (as a PDF file) that can be
          given to a customer or hung on the refrigerator
