        =============
        
        What's this for
        ---------------
        
        The Django FormWizard was not exactly what we were looking for so we decided to
        scratch our own itch and create a project that would host different types
        of form wizards for use with Django. Currently we have a SessionWizard, which is
        a form wizard that is backed by the Django session object. This wizard provides
        the ability to use the SessionWizard as a callable in the URLConf but still
        provide thread safety.
        
        Besides the storage of SessionWizard state being in session, it uses an HTTP
        GET to render a form and a POST to process a form. This differs from the
        Django FormWizard which uses POST for everything. One benefit of this is the
        ability to got to previous steps in the wizard.

        *Release date: 30-Nov-2010*
        
        * Fixed the bug where existing form data was not getting populated on a GET request.
        * Updated the process of process_POST to not automatically call self.clear().
          The developer of the wizard now should call self.clear() right before a
          successful return from self.done(). If the wizard needs to redirect to a step
          in the process because of post processing error then the SessionWizard will
          not remove the data form session now.
