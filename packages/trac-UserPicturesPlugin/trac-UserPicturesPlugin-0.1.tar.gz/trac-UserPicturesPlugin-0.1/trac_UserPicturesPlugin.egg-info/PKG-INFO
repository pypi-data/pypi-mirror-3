Description: Adds user picture icons (avatars) to Trac.
        
        Screenshots of the plugin in action can be found at https://github.com/boldprogressives/trac-UserPicturesPlugin/wiki/Screenshots
        
        Credit goes to Michael Bayer for the idea -- and most of the code -- in https://bitbucket.org/zzzeek/tracvatar
        
        The avatar engine is configurable, and two are provided in this
        package: a GravatarProvider that looks up the user's email address at
        Gravatar, and a UserManagerProvider that uses internally hosted images
        provided by the Trac UserManager Plugin if it is installed: http://trac-hacks.org/wiki/UserManagerPlugin
        
        The approach of the plugin is to filter specific Trac views, gather
        all the authors found in the "data" hash being passed to Genshi, then
        using Genshi filters to insert additional avatar nodes with the proper
        img tags. 
        
        Currently supported views are:
        
         * Timeline
         * Ticket details: reporter, owner, comments, comment diffs
         * Attachment views (on tickets, wiki pages, etc)
         * Source control views (directory listings, file contents, changesets)
         * Report and custom query views
         * Wiki history, diffs and individual versions
         * Search results
        
        This is, more or less, all the places where users show up in a
        standard Trac instance.  If you find any other places where icons
        should also be inserted, whether in a standard Trac installation or in
        a view provided by your favorite plugin, please submit an issue or a
        patch.
        
        Patches implementing additional avatar engines are also welcome.
        
        == Installation ==
        
        Install the plugin in your favorite way (python setup.py develop,
        uploading an egg, etc) and then enable its components in trac.ini like
        so::
        
          [components]
          userpictures.* = enabled
        
        You should then choose your preferred avatar engine.  For Gravatar::
        
          [userpictures]
          pictures_provider = UserPicturesGravatarProvider
        
        For UserManager, ensure that the UserManager plugin is installed, and
        then::
        
          [userpictures]
          pictures_provider = UserPicturesUserManagerProvider
        
        If you do not explicitly select either engine, a default provider is
        used which displays a blank silhouette for every user.
        
        There are a number of optional "size" settings for each view; these
        are set to sensible defaults that are designed to look good with a
        standard Trac install and the stylesheet provided by this plugin, but
        look at the source in userpictures/__init__.py (and the CSS in
        userpictures/htdocs/userpictures.css) if you really want to change the
        way the icons are displayed.
