Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        
        collective.migrator is a buildout based tool to help migrate content between Plone/Zope instances.
        It can be installed as follows:
        
            ``$ easy_install collective.migrator``
        
        
        Once installed you can run the tool to set up the migration environment
        
            ``$ migrator``
        
        
        This creates a folder called *migrator* and installs a buildout environment there. All further actions are run from this folder.
        
        The first thing that you want to do at this point is customize the *instance.cfg* file.
        
        By default it looks like this::
        
            [remote]
            host = xxx.webfactional.com
            user = ssh_user
            port = 8080
            extensions = /usr/Plone-2.5.5/zeocluster/client1/Extensions
            zmi_user = admin
            zmi_pwd = admin
            root = Plone
            export = /usr/Plone-2.5.5/zeocluster/client1/var
            
            [local]
            host = localhost
            port = 8080
            extensions = /home/suresh/plone4/parts/instance/Extensions
            zmi_user = admin
            zmi_pwd = admin
            root = Plone
            import = /home/suresh/plone4/var/instance/import
        
        
        This defines the settings for all the Plone instances involved in the migration.
        
        The *buildout.cfg* defines the steps that will be executed as part of the migration.
        
        Here is the default content::
        
            [buildout]
            extends = instance.cfg
                migrate_frontpage.cfg
                migrate_users.cfg
                migrate_props.cfg
            parts =
            tbd = 
                ${migrate_frontpage:parts}
                ${migrate_users:parts}
                ${migrate_props:parts}
        
        
        As you can see, *parts* has been intentionally left blank. Also *instance.cfg* described previously is being used here. The other *migrate_*.cfg* files contain some sample steps to move various objects between the instances.
        
        As a simple test, you can change *parts* in *buildout.cfg* to look like this::
        
            parts = export_frontpage
        
        
        This step is defined in *migrate_frontpage.cfg*.
        
        Now after you run buildout as follows:
        
        ``$ bin/buildout``
        
        
        you should notice that the front-page object has been exported in the remote Plone instance. Once you gain more confidence in the tool, you can even try to run the other steps found in the *migrate_*.cfg* files.
        
        PS: This may not be the "coolest" way to manipulate your Plone and some of these actions may be better done with GenericSetup profiles, but this worked for me!
        
        
        Troubleshooting
        ===============
        
        A couple of people have reported the following error::
        
            # migrator
            INFO: Starting migraton.
            Traceback (most recent call last):
              File "/opt/python/bin/migrator", line 5, in ?
                from pkg_resources import load_entry_point
            ImportError: No module named pkg_resources 
        
        Not sure what causes this, but I suspect a flawed python installation. *virtualenv* is a good tool
        to protect against this situation. The following modified installation procedure can be used in this
        case::
        
            $ easy_install virtualenv
            $ virtualenv --no-site-packages <my-folder>
            $ . <my-folder>/bin/activate
            $ easy_install -U setuptools
            $ easy_install -U zc.buildout
            $ easy_install collective.migrator
            $ migrator
