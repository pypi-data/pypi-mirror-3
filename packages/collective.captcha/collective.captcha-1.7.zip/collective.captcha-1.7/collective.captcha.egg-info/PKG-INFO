Description: -----------------------------
        Captchas without server state
        -----------------------------
        
        A view to generate a captcha image and/or wav file, and to verify user input
        against it.
        
        A cookie is used to transfer state from one request to the next. The state is
        used, together with a server-side secret, to create a random string of
        characters, which in turn is displayed as a captcha image, or transformed to
        an audio file. Verification happens case-insensitively.
        
        Note that the captcha 'word' is only usable for 5-10 minutes, after which the
        view will not accept it any more. Moreover, a different word will be generated
        for a given session key every 5 minutes.
        
        This makes these captchas replayable for up to 10 minutes if a determined
        user keeps sending the same session id. Because of the server-secret though,
        captchas are not transferrable between sites.
        
        Installing
        ----------
        
        This package requires Plone 2.5 or later, and plone.keyring 1.1 or later.
        
        Installing without buildout
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Install this package in either your system path packages or in the lib/python
        directory of your Zope instance. You can do this using either easy_install or
        via the setup.py script. You'll also need to install plone.keyring in the same
        fashion.
        
        After installing the package it needs to be registered in your Zope instance.
        This can be done by putting a collective.captcha-configure.zcml file in the
        etc/package-includes directory with this content::
        
          <include package="collective.captcha" />
        
        or, alternatively, you can add that line to the configure.zcml in a package or
        Product that is already registered.
        
        Installing with buildout
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        If you are using `buildout`_ to manage your instance installing
        collective.captcha is even simpler. You can install collective.captcha by
        adding it to the eggs line for your instance::
        
          [instance]
          eggs = collective.captcha
          zcml = collective.captcha
        
        The last line tells buildout to generate a zcml snippet that tells Zope
        to configure collective.captcha.
        
        If another package depends on the collective.captcha egg or includes its zcml
        directly you do not need to specify anything in the buildout configuration:
        buildout will detect this automatically.
        
        After updating the configuration you need to run the ''bin/buildout'', which
        will take care of updating your system, including installing the plone.keyring
        dependency.
        
        .. _buildout: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zc.buildout
        
        Registering plone.keyring KeyManager
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        On any Plone version prior to 3.1, you'll need to make sure that the plone.keyring KeyManager utility has been registered. In the Zope ZMI, use the portal_setup tool to run the plone.keyring KeyManager registration profile.
        
        Using the view
        --------------
        
        See the captcha.txt doctest in the collective.captcha.browser package, as well
        as captcha.txt in collective.captcha.form.

          [tseaver]
        
        - Add `verify` to the list of allowed attributes on the Captcha
          view, allowing restricted code to verify submitted captchas.

        - Better session id generation & redundant sha1 removal.
          [serhat]

          [serhat]
        
        1.6 (2011-05-29)
        ----------------
        
        - Correctly calculate the word for the next time period. Fixes
          http://plone.org/products/collective.captcha/issues/4.
          [mj]

          [cillian]
        
        1.5 (2010-01-11)
        ----------------
        
        - Fixed http://plone.org/products/collective.captcha/issues/3.
          [stefan]
        
        1.4 (2008-05-02)
        ----------------
        
        - Switched to using plone.keyring to provide the secret.
        
        1.3 (2008-02-22)
        ----------------
        
        - SkimpyGimpy now does have an egg, thanks to Reed O'Brien! Updated 
          installation instructions and setup.py.
        
        - Update test to reflect reduced character set used.
        
        1.2 (2007-12-13)
        ----------------
        
        - Add a captcha field and widget for zope.formlib.
        
        - Reduced the characters used to generate the captcha to uppercase letters and
          numbers only; user testing showed that even humans had trouble solving the
          captchas.
        
        1.1 (2007-11-21)
        ----------------
        
        - Delete the captcha cookie from the response if one is present to
          prevent premature expiration. This would happen when creating a
          new captcha after verification (because verification failed or
          the form would have to be redisplayed for other reasons). Thanks to
          David Glick for pointing this out.
        
        1.0 (2007-11-19)
        ----------------
