This directory contains questions.xml from the license_xsl module
found in subversion. questions.xml is not integrated into license.rdf 
yet, and this integration will take place at some time in the near future.

In the meantime, this directory exists to mirror questions.xml within
the license.rdf module, so that cc.license can have access to questions.xml.
Changes to the master questions.xml in license_xsl module will need to
be manually merged into this version until license.rdf completely subsumes
the Questions.
