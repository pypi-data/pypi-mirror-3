          manage_delObjects and manage_pasteObjects of BaseFolderMixin from
          Products.Archetypes.BaseFolder.
        
        * it patches the method _verifyObjectPaste from Products.CMFCore.PortalFolder
          who check the delete permission on parent object.
          
        * it applies on actions this modifications.
        
        
        Functionnally
        -------------
        
         When a user "can add" on a folder, now he can cut and delete his own creation.
