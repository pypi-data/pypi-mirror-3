        Introduction
        ============
        
        Products.SimpleReference is an addon for Products.RichDocument to enable
        Image/File referencing. Image/File referencing gives you the ability to leave
        Image/File data at one defined place in your Plone site and therefore you
        prevent having duplicate data for each RichDocument.
        
        SimpleReference adds two new types "ImageReference" and "FileReference"
        and overrides the widget templates of Products.SimpleAttachment to add these
        References via kss enabled viewlet.
        
        Overriding SA templates is done because you are now able to sort ImageAttachments
        and ImageReferences (or FileAttachments, FileReferences) in one place.
        
        
        
        This Plone Addon was developed by `Kombinat Media Gestalter GmbH`_.

          to this product. Took over the functionality developed in
          Products.SimpleAttachment/branches/referencable_content_support now you
          can install/uninstall this feature independently from SA.
          And you can upgrade your SA to 4.x blob support which you should do
          right now, if you haven't yet!
        - Initial release
