        e.g.
        %prog --projectgroup launchpad-project

        Will process every member project of launchpad-project.

        When run this program will ask Launchpad for OOPS references made since
        the last date it pruned up to, with an upper limit of one week from
        today. It then looks in the database for all oopses created during that
        date range, and if they are not in the set returned by Launchpad,
        deletes them. If the database has never been pruned before, it will
        pick the earliest date present in the repository as the start date.

        This does not delete OOPS files that are on disk (e.g. created by
        amqp2disk) - a separate pruner is available in oops-datedir-repo that
        should be used to prune them.
