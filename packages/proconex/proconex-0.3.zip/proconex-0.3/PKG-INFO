Description: 
        Proconex is a module to simplify the implementation of the producer/consumer
        idiom. In addition to simple implementations based on Python's ``Queue.Queue``,
        proconex also takes care of exceptions raised during producing or consuming
        items and ensures that all the work shuts down in a clean manner without
        leaving zombie threads.
        
        Example Usage
        =============
        
        In order to use proconex, we need a few preparations.
        
        First, set up Python's logging:
        
        >>> import logging
        >>> logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
        
        In case you want to use the `with` statement to clean up and still use Python
        2.5, you need to import it:
        
        >>> from __future__ import with_statement
        
        And finally, we of course need to import proconex itself:
        
        >>> import proconex
        
        Here is a simple producer that reads lines from a file:
        
        >>> class LineProducer(proconex.Producer):
        ...     def __init__(self, fileToReadPath):
        ...         super(LineProducer, self).__init__()
        ...         self._fileToReadPath = fileToReadPath
        ...     def items(self):
        ...         with open(self._fileToReadPath, 'rb') as fileToRead:
        ...             for lineNumber, line in enumerate(fileToRead, start=1):
        ...                 yield (lineNumber, line.rstrip('\n\r'))
        
        The constructor can take any parameters you need to set up the producer. In
        this case, all we need is the path to the file to read, ``fileToReadPath``.
        The constructor simply stores the value in an attribute for later reference.
        
        The function ``items()`` typically is implemented as generator and yields the
        produced items one after another until there are no more items to produce. In
        this case, we just return the file line by line as a tuple of line number and
        line contents without trailing newlines.
        
        Next, we need a consumer. Here is a simple one that processes the lines read
        by the producer above and prints its number and text:
        
        >>> class LineConsumer(proconex.Consumer):
        ...     def consume(self, item):
        ...         lineNumber, line = item
        ...         if "self" in line:
        ...             print u"line %d: %s" % (lineNumber, line)
        
        With classes for producer and consumer defined, we can create a producer and a
        list of consumers:
        
        >>> producer =  LineProducer(__file__)
        >>> consumers = [LineConsumer("consumer#%d" % consumerId)
        ...         for consumerId in xrange(3)]
        
        To actually start the production process, we need a worker to control the
        producer and consumers:
        
        >>> with proconex.Worker(producer, consumers) as lineWorker:
        ...     lineWorker.work() # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
        line ...
        
        The with statement makes sure that all threads are terminated once the worker
        finished or failed. Alternatively you can use ``try ... except ... finally``
        to handle errors and cleanup:
        
        >>> producer =  LineProducer(__file__)
        >>> consumers = [LineConsumer("consumer#%d" % consumerId)
        ...         for consumerId in xrange(3)]
        >>> lineWorker = proconex.Worker(producer, consumers)
        >>> try:
        ...     lineWorker.work()
        ... except Exception, error:
        ...     print error
        ... finally:
        ...    lineWorker.close() # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
        line ...
        
        Additionally to ``Worker`` there also is a ``Converter``, which  not only
        produces and consumes items but also yields converted items. While
        ``Converter``s use the same ``Producer``s as ``Worker``s, they require
        different consumers based on ``ConvertingConsumer``. Such a consumer has a
        ``addItem()`` which ``consume()`` should use to add the converted item.
        
        Here is an example for a consumer that converts consumed integer numbers to
        their square value:
        
        >>> class SquareConvertingIntegerConsumer(proconex.ConvertingConsumer):
        ...     def consume(self, item):
        ...         self.addItem(item * item)
        
        A fitting producer for integer numbers between 0 and 4 is:
        
        >>> class IntegerProducer(proconex.Producer):
        ...     def items(self):
        ...         for item in xrange(5):
        ...             yield item
        
        Combining these in a converter, we get:
        
        >>> with proconex.Converter(IntegerProducer("producer"), 
        ...         SquareConvertingIntegerConsumer("consumer")) as converter:
        ...     for item in converter.items():
        ...         print item
        0

        Limitations
        ===========
        
        When using proconex, there are a few things you should be aware of:
        
        * Due to Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), at least one of producer and
           consumer should be I/O bound in order to allow thread switches.
        * The code contains a few polling loops because ``Queue`` does
           not support canceling `get()` and `put()`. The polling does not drain the
           CPU because it uses a timeout when waiting for events to happen. Still,
           there is room for improvement and contributions are welcome.
        * The only way to recover from errors during production is to restart the
           whole process from the beginning.
        
        If you need more flexibility and control than proconex offers, try
        `celery <http://celeryproject.org/>`_.

        Version history
        ===============
        
        Version 0.3, 2012-01-06
        
        * Added ``Converter`` class, which is similar to ``Worker`` but expects
          consumers to yield results the caller can process.
        * Changed exceptions raised by producer and consumer to preserve their stack
          trace when passed to the ``Worker`` or ``Converter``.  
        
        Version 0.2, 2012-01-04
        
        * Added support for multiple producers.
        * Added limit for queue size. By default it is twice the number of consumers.
        
        Version 0.1, 2012-01-03
        
        * Initial public release.
