Description: Python bindings to the Rackspace Cloud Servers API
        ==================================================
	- This Package was modified by Kevin Carter, to be compatible with the UK API.  
	- python-cloudservers was completely changed so that it is now python-ukcloudservers  which will create a command ukcloudservers
        
        This is a client for Rackspace's Cloud Servers API. There's a Python API (the
        ``ukcloudservers`` module), and a command-line script (``ukcloudservers``). Each
        implements 100% of the Rackspace API.
        
        `Full documentation is available`__.
        
        __ http://packages.python.org/python-ukcloudservers/
        
        You'll also probably want to read `Rackspace's API guide`__ (PDF) -- the first
        bit, at least -- to get an idea of the concepts. Rackspace is doing the cloud
        hosting thing a bit differently from Amazon, and if you get the concepts this
        library should make more sense.

        Development takes place on GitHub__. Bug reports and patches may be filed there.

        Command-line API
        ----------------
        
        Installing this package gets you a shell command, ``ukcloudservers``, that you
        can use to interact with Rackspace.
        
        You'll need to provide your Rackspace username and API key. You can do this
        with the ``--username`` and ``--apikey`` params, but it's easier to just set
        them as environment variables::
        
        export CLOUD_SERVERS_USERNAME=jacobian
        export CLOUD_SERVERS_API_KEY=yadayada
        
        You'll find complete documentation on the shell by running
        ``ukcloudservers help``::
        
        usage: ukcloudservers [--username USERNAME] [--apikey APIKEY] <subcommand> ...
        
        Command-line interface to the Cloud Servers API.
        
        Positional arguments:

        Python API
        ----------
        
        There's also a `complete Python API`__.
        
        __ http://packages.python.org/python-ukcloudservers/
        
        By way of a quick-start::
        
        >>> import ukcloudservers
        >>> cs = ukcloudservers.CloudServers(USERNAME, API_KEY)
        >>> cs.flavors.list()
        [...]
        >>> cs.servers.list()
        [...]
        >>> s = cs.servers.create(image=2, flavor=1, name='myserver')
        
        ... time passes ...
        
        >>> s.reboot()
        
        ... time passes ...
        
        >>> s.delete()
        
        FAQ
        ---
        
        What's wrong with libcloud?
        
        Nothing! However, as a cross-service binding it's by definition lowest
        common denominator; I needed access to the Rackspace-specific APIs (shared
        IP groups, image snapshots, resizing, etc.). I also wanted a command-line
        utility.
        
        What's new?

        New in ``python-ukcloudservers`` 1.1
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        * Added support for uploading files to the shell ``boot`` command (via the
