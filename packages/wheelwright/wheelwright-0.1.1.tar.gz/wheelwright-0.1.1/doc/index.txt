Wheelwright
===========

Wheelwright helps you build, repair, or maintain bicycle wheels by
easily visualizing the tension of each spoke in relation to the target
tension desired for the rim.

Features
--------

* Visualizes spoke tension, quickly showing whether the wheel is within spec
* Converts deflection readings from Park Tool's TM-1 tension meter to kilograms-force (kgf) --- support for other tension meters is planned for future releases
* Outputs a pretty report of the wheel (as a PDF file) that can be given to a customer or hung on the refrigerator
