Plugins
=======

Plugins can extend beets' core functionality. Plugins can add new commands to
the command-line interface, respond to events in beets, augment the autotagger,
or provide new path template functions.

Using Plugins
-------------

To use a plugin, you have two options:

* Make sure it's in the Python path (known as `sys.path` to developers). This
  just means the plugin has to be installed on your system (e.g., with a
  `setup.py` script or a command like `pip` or `easy_install`).

* Set the `pythonpath` config variable to point to the directory containing the
  plugin. (See :doc:`/reference/cli`.)

Then, set the `plugins` option in your `~/.beetsconfig` file, like so::

    [beets]
    plugins = mygreatplugin someotherplugin

The value for `plugins` should be a space-separated list of plugin module names.

Other Plugins
-------------

Here are a few of the plugins written by the beets community:

* `beetFs`_ is a FUSE filesystem for browsing the music in your beets library.
  (Might be out of date.)

* `Beet-MusicBrainz-Collection`_ lets you add albums from your library to your
  MusicBrainz `"music collection"`_.

* `A cmus plugin`_ integrates with the `cmus`_ console music player.

Writing Plugins
---------------

If you know a little Python, you can write your own plugin to do almost anything
you can imagine with your music collection. See the :doc:`guide to writing beets
plugins </plugins/writing>`.
