Description: Overview
        ========
        
        
        `ftw.dashboard.dragndrop` adds persistent dragndrop functionality to the standard plone dashboard.
        
        Features:
        
        - **Drag'n'drop**:
        All dashboard portlets can be moved with drag'n'drop from column to column and reordered in the column.
        - **Folding**:
        Dashboard porlets are foldable.
        - **Edit portlet icon**:
        Dashboard portlets have an icon on the top (pencil) for editing the portlet.
        - **close/remove portlet**:
        Dashboard portlets have an icon on the top (cross) for removing the portlet from the dashboard.
        
        
        Install
        =======
        
        - Add ``ftw.dashboard.dragndrop`` to your buildout configuration:
        
        ::
        
        [instance]
        eggs =
        ftw.dashboard.dragndrop
        
        - Run buildout.
        
        - Install ``ftw.dashboard.dragndrop`` in portal_setup.
        
        - Configure the dashboard in the ``portal_properties`` tool (addablePortlets).
        
        
        Properties:
        -----------
        
        - **dashboardEditable**:
        True: The dashboard will always be editable, all functionalities are available
        False: The standard view (``@@dashboard``) will only provide the dragndrop and the fold functionality. Use the ``@@manage-dashbord`` view to customize your dashboard.
        
        - **columnNumber**:
        Number of dashboard columns. There are only 4 portlet managers provided by plone. If you need more you need to register additional dashboard portlet managers.
        
        - **addablePortlets**:
        Defines the addable portlets.
        You can use "portlet.Calendar" or "portlet.Calendar:Portlet Calendar". With the latter form you can change the title of the portlet.
