### Download

Parcon is available on the Python Package Index. The easiest way to install it is to open up a command prompt or a terminal and run this:

	pip install parcon

The PyPI page on Parcon is <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi?:action=search&term=parcon">here</a>. There's a link on that page to download the latest version of Parcon, if you want to download it by hand.

Both of those methods will get you Pargen and Static, two libraries provided as submodules of Parcon, as well.
