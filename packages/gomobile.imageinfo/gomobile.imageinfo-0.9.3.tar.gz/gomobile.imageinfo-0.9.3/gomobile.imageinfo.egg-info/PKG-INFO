        Introduction
        ------------
        
        ``gomobile.imageinfo`` is abstraction layer to access image data in different Zope image objects. 
        It takes in any image object or traversable path and returns Python Imaging Library object for it.
        
        The package is a part of mFabrik `Web and Mobile <http://webandmobile.mfabrik.com>`_ solutions package
        to build multichannel content management with Python.
        
        Supported different image objects include
            
        * Skin layer images, both file system based and ZMI uploads
            
        * Archetypes ATImage
            
        * Resource folder images (static media)
        
        * Images hosted on another server (http:// download)
        
        This package is mainly used with Go Mobile for Plone project to dynamically resize images for mobile presentation,
        regardless what kind of image there was in the source code. It is used to extract image width and height,
        calculate proper mobile image size and then resize the image for that size on a second pass.
