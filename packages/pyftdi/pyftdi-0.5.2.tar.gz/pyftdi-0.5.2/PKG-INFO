Description: ========
         PyFtdi
        ========
        
        Overview
        ~~~~~~~~
        
        PyFtdi aims at providing a user-space driver for modern FTDI_ devices,
        implemented in pure Python language.
        
        Modern FTDI_ devices include:
        
        * FT2232D (dual port, clock up to 6 MHz)
        * FT2232H (dual port, clock up to 30 MHz)
        * FT4232H (quad port, clock up to 30 MHz)
        
        Other FTDI_ devices could also be supported (including FT232* devices),
        although these devices are not a primary goal for PyFtdi, and therefore have
        not been tested with PyFtdi.
        
        Extras
        ------
        This module also contains a basic driver for Prolific PL2303 chip written in
        pure Python. PL2303 is not an FTDI device, but it may serve the same purpose:
        a USB-to-serial adapter.
        
        As such, a Python driver for this device has been added to this project sarting
        at version 0.4.0, so that a PL2303 serial adaptor can be used as an FTDI
        alternative to drive a serial port from a USB bus.
        
        Primary goals
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        It should support the following modes:
        
        * UART/Serial USB converter, up to 12Mbps (depending on the FTDI device
          capability)
        * SPI master
        * JTAG master
        * Bitbang/GPIO support (not a primary goal)
        
        PyFtdi should provide a pyserial_ compliant API, to be used as a drop-in module
        to access USB-serial converters based on FTDI_ devices.

        Requirements
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        PyFtdi relies on PyUSB_, which itself depends on one of the following native
        libraries:
        
        * libusb-1.0 (recommended)
        * libusb-0.1 (deprecated)
        * openusb (not tested with pyftdi)
        
        PyFtdi does not depend on any other native library, and only uses standard
        Python modules.
        
        To use the serial port feature of PyFtdi, pyserial_ 2.5+ module should be
        installed.
        
        Python_ 2.6 or above is required. Python_ 3.x is not yet supported.

        Status
        ~~~~~~
        
        This project is still at an early alpha development stage.
        
        However, PyFtdi is being forked from a closed-source software implementation
        that has been successfully used for over a year - including serial, spi and
        jtag protocols, based on top of the libftdi_ open source library.
        
        libftdi_ is now being phased out from this closed-source project and replaced
        with PyFtdi, to ease maintenance and customization.
        
        Meanwhile, PyFtdi is developed as an open-source solution.
        
        Supported features
        ------------------
        * All FTDI device ports (UART, MPSSE) can be used simultaneously.
        * Serial port, up to 12 Mbps. PyFtdi includes a pyserial_ emulation layer that
          offers transparent access to the FTDI serial ports through a pyserial_-
          compliant API. The ``serialext`` directory contains a minimal serial terminal
          demonstrating the use of this extension, and a dispatcher automatically
          selecting the serial backend (pyserial_, PyFtdi), based on the serial port
          name.
        * SPI master. PyFtdi includes several examples demonstrating how to use the
          FTDI SPI master with a pure-Python serial flash device driver for several
          common devices. For now, SPI Mode 0 (CPOL=0, CPHA=0) is the only supported
          mode. It should be easy to extend the SPI master to deal with less common
          modes. These tests show an average 470 KB/s read out from flash devices
          running with a 6 MHz SPI clock on a Core2Duo Mac Book Pro.
        * JTAG is under development and is not fully supported yet.

        Installation
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        Since PyUSB 1.0.0a2, USB bus enumeration can be performed without applying
        any patch.
        
         * Download pyusb-1.0.0a2
         * Install pyusb
         * Install pyftdi
        
        Troubleshooting
        ---------------
        
        *"Error: No backend available"*
          libusb native library cannot be loaded. Try helping the dynamic loader:
        
          * On Linux: ``export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<path>``
        
           where <path> is the directory containing the ``libusb-1.*.so`` library file
        
          * On Mac OS X: ``export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=.../lib``
        
           where <path> is the directory containing the ``libusb-1.*.dylib`` library file
        
        Development
        ~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        PyFtdi is developed on Mac OS X platforms (including 64-bit kernels), and is
        validated on a regular basis on Linux hosts.
        
        As it contains no native code, it should work on any PyUSB_ and libusb_
        supported platforms, including but not limited to, Windows.
