Configuration File
==================

Behaviour can be controlled by a config file at

  $HOME/.config/pkgme-binary/conf

Currently one section is supported for configuring database access.
This can either be sqlite or postgres.

You can override the location of this configuration file by setting the
environment variable ``PKGME_DEVPORTAL_CONFIG_FILE``.


SQLite
------

The file should look something like::

  [database]
  db_type = sqlite
  path = /path/to/file.db

Postgres
--------

The file should look something like::

  [database]
  db_type = postgres
  host = <db host>
  port = <db port>
  username = <db username>
  password = <db password>
  db_name = <db name>

Tables within the database will be created by the tool itself.

Acceptance tests
================

There is an acceptance test suite that is not run as part of the
unit tests. You can run these tests in virtualenv with

  python -m testtools.run acceptance.tests

or in the rootdir of the checkout with

  PYTHONPATH=$(pwd) python -m testtools.run acceptance.tests
