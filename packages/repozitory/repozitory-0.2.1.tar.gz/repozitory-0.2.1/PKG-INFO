Description: Repozitory is a library for archiving documents and recovering old
        versions. It is designed to work in tandem with a primary document
        storage mechanism such as ZODB. Repozitory stores the document versions
        in a PostgreSQL or SQLite database using SQLAlchemy. Repozitory was
        built for KARL, an open source online collaboration system, but
        Repozitory is intended to be useful for any Python project that stores
        user-editable documents.  Repozitory does not require ZODB.

        Changes
        =======
        
        0.2.1 (2011-09-22)
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed packaging on PyPI (essential files were missing;
          setuptools-git was needed.)
        
        0.2 (2011-09-15)
        ----------------
        
        - Added the new_container_ids attribute to deleted item records.  This
          allows undeletion UIs to filter out objects that have moved to another
          container.  It should also allow applications to redirect users to the new
          location of a moved object.  No schema migration is needed.
        
        - Added the get_version method to archives.  The get_version method is more
          efficient than iterating over the entire history of an object.
        
        0.1 (2011-08-14)
        ----------------
        
        - Initial release.
