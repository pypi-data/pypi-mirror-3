Description: sala - encrypted plaintext password store
        *****************************************
        
        Sala lets you store passwords and other bits of sensitive plain-text
        information to encrypted files on a directory hierarchy. The
        information is protected by GnuPG's symmetrical encryption.
        
        Basic usage
        ===========
        
        Passwords are stored in a directory hierarchy, each file containing
        one secret.
        
        Commands:
        
        ``sala init``
            Initialize a password store
        
        ``sala get FILE...``
            Read secret(s)
        
        ``sala set FILE...``
            Create or modify secret(s)
        
        ``sala FILE...``
            Read or modify, depending on whether the first file exists or not
        
        For more information, see sala(1) and http://www.digip.org/sala/.
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Install sala by invoking::
        
            pip install sala
        
        To install from source, invoke::
        
            python setup.py install
        
        Requirements:
        
        * Python_ 2.6, 2.7, or 3.2 (or newer 3.x).
        * GnuPG_
        
        Suggested packages:
        
        * pwgen_: With the default configuration, if ``pwgen`` is installed,
          it's used to suggest good passwords to the user

        Development
        ===========
        
        The test suite is in the ``test/`` directory. Use the ``run-tests.py``
        script to run the test suite. For more info, invoke::
        
            python run-tests.py --help
        
        cram_ 0.5 or newer is required to run the tests. If coverage_ is
        installed, the script can also show test coverage.
        
        The documentation is in the ``doc/`` directory. To build a manpage
        and a HTML documentation page, invoke
        ::
        
            make -C doc
        
        in the top directory. Docutils_ 0.8 or newer is required.

        Release history
        ===============
        
        Version 1.3
        -----------

        * Add a bash completion script: contrib/sala-completion.bash.
        
        * Move the repository state to the .sala subdirectory. .salakey
          becomes .sala/key and sala.conf becomes .sala/config.
        
        * Add support for hooks in .sala/hooks. Initially, the post-set hook
          is supported.

        * Add support for Python 3.2, drop support for Python 2.5.
