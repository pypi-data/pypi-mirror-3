python-geoprobe:
================
python-geoprobe is a python module to read and write geoprobe horizons,
volumes, and faults.


This implementation is based on reverse-engineering the file formats, and as
such, is certainly not complete. However, things seem to work.

Dependencies: 
=============
Requires python >= 2.5 and numpy. Some functions (e.g.  horizon.toGeotiff)
require gdal and its python bindings. The plotting functions in utilities (e.g.
utilities.wiggles) and some swfault functionality requires matplotlib.

Installation: 
=============
Installation should be as simple as "python setup.py install"
