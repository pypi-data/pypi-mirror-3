=== 0.5 (ongoing development) ===

=== 0.4 ===

- Changed test_settings.py so that only 'admin.py$' files are excluded from
  coverage. Before this change, an app with the name 'foobar_admin' would
  be completely excluded from coverage, which is bad.

=== 0.3 ===

- Added test mixins to ease the process of writing integration tests with
  self.client.get. See the docs for further explanation.

=== 0.2 ===

- Added custom testrunner (see docs/testrunner.rst)
