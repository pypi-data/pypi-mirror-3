sources for whatever reason.

 * The classes to represent SWF elements are generated as part of the build
   process, by processing codegen/source.xml through the codegen/mk.xsl XSLT
   stylesheet. The resulting code is not well indented.
   
 * The generated base classes are derived from SWFTag, SWFAction, SWFStyle,
   SWFFilter or (for <type/>s in source.xml) no base class at all (for things
   like "Rectangle"). Fonts are certainly special, both the contents of the
   DefineFont2 tag (not a "clean", generated class but the SWFGlyphList kludge)
   as well as freetype handling and conversion to the proper shape definitions.
   
 * The basic I/O code is in SWFFile (for header, compression) and
   SWFReader/Writer (for anything else, including SWF-style nBit numbers etc.)
   
 * The XSL stylesheet that makes up the "simple" processing mode (which is
   itself everything but simple) is built in src/xslt/. there's more README
   there.
