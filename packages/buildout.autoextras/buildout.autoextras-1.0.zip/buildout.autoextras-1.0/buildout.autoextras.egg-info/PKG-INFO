Description: buildout.autoextras
        ===================
        
        Buildout (zc.buildout) extension for including setuptools extras_require
        options for all items in a target option if the extra exists.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        This is a buildout extension, so simply add it to your extensions list::
        
            [buildout]
            extensions = buildout.autoextras
        
        Options
        -------
        
        There are two options...
        
        autoextra-keys
            A list of extra keys (e.g. test, zcml, etc.) that should be included if
            the package has the extra.
        
        autoextra-targets
            A list of targets to check for the extras. For example, a buildout part
            named ``demo`` that has an ``eggs`` option. The target in this case would
            be ``demo:eggs``. This is similar to zc.buildout's variable replace
            syntax except without the ``${}`` symbolling. 
        
        Together these options might look something like::
        
            [buildout]
            extensions = buildout.autoextras
            parts = demo
            autoextra-keys = zcml
            autoextra-targets = demo:eggs
        
            [demo]
            recipe = zc.recipe.eggs
            eggs =
                zope.testing
                zope.i18n
