Description: About 
        =====
        
        Slideshow Folder provides a simple, elegant animated slideshow for
        Plone.
        
        Slideshow Folder integrates the `Slideshow 2` javascript class into
        Plone. Slideshow 2 a powerful, feature-rich, easy-to-customize slideshow
        library -- big thanks to Aeron Glemann all of the hard work he's poured
        into it!
        
        .. _`Slideshow 2`: http://www.electricprism.com/aeron/slideshow
        
        Slideshow Folder offers the following features:
        
         * Animated slideshows with configurable transitions
        
         * Navigation thumbnails
        
         * Image captions
        
         * Intelligent preloading of images to save bandwidth
        
         * A play/pause/forward/reverse slideshow controller
        
         * Looping and random-order slideshows
        
         * Optional support for "lightbox" style image pop-ups
        
         * Look and feel completely customizable via CSS
        
        Design Rationale
        ====================
        
        Slideshow Folder uses Zope 3 development techniques to enable normal Plone 
        Folders, Collections and Images with configurable slideshow views.
        
        We wanted to develop a slideshow product for Plone that would avoid creating
        custom content types for the images and slideshow folders in order to allow 
        easy installation, re-use of existing images in the site and to avoid 
        "stranding" content in future upgrades or when you remove the product.
        
        
        Dependencies 
        ====================
        
        Slideshow Folder is easiest to install and use under Plone 3.x, but also 
        supports Plone 2.5.2+.  
        However, in order to use Slideshow Folder under Plone 2.5, you must be 
        comfortable installing software from SVN checkout.
        
        Slideshow Folder requires:
        
         * Plone 3.0+ strongly recommended (Plone 2.5.2+ works, but requires the 
           following dependences)
        
         * CMFonFive 1.3.4 (ONLY if using Plone 2.5.x - 
           http://codespeak.net/z3/cmfonfive/)
        
         * Five 1.4 (ONLY if using Plone 2.5.x - http://codespeak.net/z3/five/)
        
         * plone.app.form (ONLY if using Plone 2.5.x - check out from
           http://svn.plone.org/svn/plone/plone.app.form/branches/plone-2.5
        
        
        Installation 
        ====================
        
        Plone 3.x, buildout-based installer
        -----------------------------------
        
        If you are using Plone 3.x via a buildout-based installer, simply add 
        "Products.slideshowfolder" to the [eggs] section of your buildout.
        
         * Beginning with Plone 3.1, Plone's universal installer for Unix uses buildout.
         
         * Plone 3.2 and higher will use buildout for Windows, Mac OSX and Unix 
           universal installers.
        
        
        Plone 3.0.x, non-buildout installer
        -----------------------------------
        
        Slideshow Folder installs in the conventional way.  Unzip the tarball and copy 
        the product folder "slideshowfolder" into your Zope Products directory and 
        restart your Zope instance.  You can then install it into your Plone site from
        the Plone Control Panel or the ZMI's portal_quickinstaller.  Uninstall it the
        same way.
        
        Plone 2.5.x, non-buildout installer
        -------------------------------------
        
        Download Slideshow Folder and its dependencies, listed above.
        
        Install Slideshow Folder, CMFOnFive and Five in your Zope instance's Products 
        folder as normal.
        
        plone.app.form must be checked out from SVN and installed in your Zope's 
        instance's lib/python/plone/app/form directory.  It can be a bit tricky to 
        unpack the directories correctly.  
        Tip: you get a directory called  plone.app.form, but you need to go to your
        Zope instance's lib/python folder and do::
        
          mkdir plone (if it doesn't exist)
          cd plone
          mkdir app (if it doesn't exist)
          cd app
          mkdir form
        
        Then go to your unpacked plone.app.form directory and do::
        
          mv plone/app/form/*  yourzopeinstance/lib/python/plone/app/form
        
        
        Plone 2.5.x, buildout-based installation
        ----------------------------------------
        
        Add "Products.slideshowfolder" to the [eggs] section of your buildout.
        
        Consult buildout documentation for tips on installing CMFOnFive, Five tarballs 
        and plone.app.form from SVN.  Warning: this will require some experience using
        buildout for more complex installations.
        
        
        Using Slideshow Folder
        ======================
        
        Each Folder and Collection in your site will have a new option in its
        "action" menu -- "make slideshow". Choosing that will select a slideshow
        view for that folder and give you a new "Slideshow Settings"
        configuration tab.  As soon as there are published images in the folder,
        you'll see the slideshow.  (Collections rely on the criteria that you
        put in them to render the images for the slideshow.  Non-images are
        ignored.  That means that workflow restrictions are based solely on your
        Collection's criteria.)
        
        To change the slideshow's settings, see the new "slideshow settings" tab
        on the folder.
        
        Each image's Description will be used for its caption.  If there is no
        description, the Title will be used.
        
        Each slideshow will have an "disable slideshow" option in the action
        menu.  This will revert it to being a normal Folder (or Smart Folder),
        including deleting the slideshow settings.  (It will not delete any
        content, though.)
        
        Note: The slideshow will only include published images in the folder.
        You can customize this (rather crudely) by customizing
        folder_slideshow.pt and calling the setWorkflowFilter method on the
        slideshow view.  (Options include "None" or any valid workflow state.)
        Consult the interfaces.py for documentation on those methods.
        (Alternatively, you can use a Collection and not place any workflow
        restrictions on your criteria.)
        
        Note: Only a subset of the options for Aeron Glemann's library
        are supported via the 'Slideshow Settings' tab.  See
        http://code.google.com/p/slideshow/wiki/Slideshow
        for the full list of options.  If customization beyond the options
        exposed via the web interface is needed, you can customize
        slideshow_settings.js.pt to specify the additional options.
        
        Note: You may use your own custom image content type as long as it
        implements the Products.slideshowfolder.interfaces.ISlideshowImage
        interface (which requires an Archetypes ImageField named 'image' in
        its schema.)  (Plone 3.0+ only.)
        
        
        Limitations
        ===========
        
        Slideshow Folder currently has several limitations, most of which flow
        from the Slideshow 2 javascript class it is based on.
        
         * Transitions cannot be set on a per-slide basis, only for all the
           slides in the slideshow.
           
         * In IE, the slideshow does not operate properly when logged in as a
           Manager and accessing the site at http://localhost/.  You can work
           around this by using http://127.0.0.1/ instead.  See
           http://plone.org/products/slideshowfolder/issues/46 for details.

        History
        =======
        
        4.1 - beta (2012-03-02)
        -----------------------
        
        - Added .metadata files for skin based images, js and css to get 
          slideshowfolder cacheable.
          [pelle\_]
        
        - Use current plone markup style (folder_listing.pt) to solve the template 
          error when having the Plone Site it self as a slideshow. 
          http://plone.org/products/slideshowfolder/issues/57/view.
          [pelle\_]
        
        - Added basic functional/browser test setup and added a test that covers the 
          case where slideshow is used for the Plone Site root currently raising a 
          template error http://plone.org/products/slideshowfolder/issues/57/view.
          [pelle\_]
        
        - Fixed an error, occured if layout-property was set before making a folder a
          slideshowfolder and then unmaking it again [tom_gross]
        
        - Use correct permission for slideshowsettings-view. [tom_gross]
        
        - Added german translation [tom_gross]
        
        - Updated JavaScript to Slideshow2r147 [tom_gross]
        
        - Fixed AttributeError, if JavaScript was called with wrong context [tom_gross]
        
        4.0 - final (2008-07-30)
        ------------------------
        
        - Documented workaround for obscure issue with viewing slideshow when logged 
          in, using IE as the browser, and accessing the site at http://localhost/.
          [davisagli]
        
        - Changed the permission checked when deciding whether to display a warning 
          about needing to add images to a slideshow-enabled folder to 'ATContentTypes: 
          Add Image'. Also removed detail about publishing, since images are no longer 
          associated with a workflow by default.
          [jessesnyder]
        
        4.0 - release candidate 2 (2008-07-18)
        --------------------------------------
        
        - Worked around an obscure Javascript error affecting IE when logged in.
          [davisagli]
        
        - Applied patch for http://code.google.com/p/slideshow/issues/detail?id=28&can=1
          from upstream, which fixes an issue where images weren't displayed when serving
          via a proxy.
          [davisagli]
        
        4.0 - release candidate 1 (2008-07-11)
        --------------------------------------
        
        - Added "Slideshowfolder: Manage slideshow settings" permission
          (assigned to Manager, Editor, and Owner roles by default.)
          [davisagli]
        
        - Added i18n infrastructure.
          [davisagli]
        
        - Improved compatibility with things that are not ATImages but implement the 
          same interface (ISlideshowImage).
          [davisagli]
        
        - Switched settings form to use formlib.
          [davisagli]
        
        - Modified mootools 'protect' flag to work around still-present conflict with 
          kupuhelpers.js
          [davisagli]
        
        - Switched to "Slideshow 2" javascript and Mootools 1.2.
          Changes to templates, settings to expose new features.
          [jonstahl]
        
        
        3.0 alpha 2 - unreleased
        ------------------------
        
        - Using proper noLongerProvides zope.interface API for removing a marker 
          interface from content object
          [andrewb]
        
        - Removing testJSRegisteryHasResources per no longer present mootools.js, 
          slideshow.js in JS registry. This is now pulled in via a metal slot (see 
          below for more)
          [andrewb]
        
        - Load javascript via a metal slot rather than via the javascript registry, 
          to avoid conflicting with kupu.
          [davisagli]
        
        
        3.0 alpha 1 - 2007.12.11
        ------------------------
        
        - Moved registration of "slideshow settings" action to Generic Setup; it gets re-registered in Plone 3.0 to 
          a different action id via a separate profile.
        
        
        1.2.2 - 2007.12.11
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed conditional zope.annotations import in a more graceful way.
          [FinnArild]
        
        - Removed newlines from image descriptions; they were breaking the js.  Thanks to "Taun" for finding this.
          [jbaldivieso]
        
        - Fixed another js bug caused by a misplaced comma.
          [jbaldivieso]
          
        
        1.2.1 - 2007.10.29
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed a minor bug where duration settings were not getting respected due to malformed JS.
          [jbaldivieso]
        
        
        1.2 - 2007.10.22
        ----------------
        
        - Finished support for Smart Folders -- slideshows now show up properly for them. (Rich Topics
          are supported.) (issue #14)
          [jbaldivieso]
        
        - Fixed the slideshow settings javascript so that it works in IE.
          [jbaldivieso]
        
        - cleaned up the Generic Setup install steps.  (No bugs were reported, but installation could have
          been a little funny before.)
          [jbaldivieso]
        
        - Slideshows now use full absolute urls for image sources. This should mean that spaces in image
          names are escaped properly.  (issue #15)
          [jbaldivieso]
          
        
        1.1 - 2007.10.04
        ----------------
        
        - Restructured how the slideshow settings are delivered to the template. Separated out
          the data from the presentation (no more HTML/JS coming directly from the browser view).
          In so doing:
          
          - gave support for Unicode image captions (issue #8)
          - gave skin-level support for filtering slideshow image content based on WF (i.e.,
            showing non-published images in a slideshow is a template change now)
          
          [jbaldivieso]
         
        - Modified the slideshow template to give feedback when the folder didn't have content
          for a slideshow (including a message of advice if you are a content editor).  (issue #7)
          [jbaldivieso]
        
        - Uninstall process examines all folders in the catalog and unslideshowifies them (as
          long as you're not reinstalling) (issue #9). Uninstall also removes its traces from
          portal_actions.
          [jbaldivieso]
        
        - Refactored the way slideshows are activated. One switch does it all (including changing
          the view template). All folders may now be activated, regardless of whether they have
          images in them yet. Slideshows may also now be deactivated.
          [jbaldivieso]
        
        - Use backgroundColor from base_properties for slideshow bg color (issue #3).
          [jbaldivieso]
        
        
        1.0 - 2007.09.??
        ----------------
        
        - First release.
