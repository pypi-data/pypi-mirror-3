L1L2Py is a Python package to perform variable selection by means
of l1l2 regularization with double optimization.

L1L2Py makes use of NumPy <http://numpy.scipy.org> to provide fast
N-dimensional array manipulation and is the Python implementation of the
method proposed and applied in [DeMol09]_.

L1L2Py is a project of the SlipGURU - Statistical Learning and Image Processing
Genoa University Research Group - Via Dodecaneso, 35 - 16146 Genova, ITALY
