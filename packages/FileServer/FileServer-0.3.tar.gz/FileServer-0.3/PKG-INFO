        ===========
        
        a simple static fileserver and directory index server in python (WSGI app)
        
        About
        -----
        
        Often for testing you will want a static fileserver and directory
        index as part of your WSGI stack.  In addition, you may have
        requirements to run such as part of a production WSGI
        stack. FileServer fits these needs.
        
        Motivation
        ----------
        
        I needed a directory index server a la Apache to test a PyPI clone I
        was using.  After surveying what was out there, there didn't seem
        anything out there that was easily consumable for my purposes.  So I
        wrote one only depending on
        `webob <http://www.webob.org/>`_ .
        
        Contents
        --------
        
        ``from fileserver import *`` should give you access to all of the
        usable components of fileserver:
        
         * ``file_response``: return a webob response object appropriate to a
           file name
         * ``FileApp``: WSGI app that wraps ``file_response``
         * ``Directory Server``: serves a directory tree and generated indices
         * ``main``: command line entry point
        
        ``FileApp`` and ``file_response`` are heavily borrowed from
        http://docs.webob.org/en/latest/file-example.html .
        I also borrowed from Paste's ``StaticURLParser`` and ``static.Cling``.
        
        In addition there is a command line script, ``serve``, which may be
        used to serve a directory with the
        `wsgiref <http://docs.python.org/library/wsgiref.html>`_ server.
        
        Tests
        -----
        
        doctests and a test runner, ``test.py``, exist in the ``tests/``
        subdirectory of http://k0s.org/hg/FileServer . I currently use
        ``paste.fixture.TestApp`` to mock requests and inspect responses, but
        should probably move to
        `WebTest <http://webtest.pythonpaste.org/en/latest/index.html>`_ .
        
        Other Projects
        --------------
        
        While I didn't find them suitable for my use, there are other
        standalone static fileservers available for python:
        
         * `static <http://lukearno.com/projects/static/>`_
        
         * `Paste <http://pythonpaste.org/modules/urlparser.html>`_ ``StaticURLParser``
        
         * `SimpleHTTPServer <http://docs.python.org/library/simplehttpserver.html>`_
