Description: managesieve 0.4.2
        =================
        
        A ManageSieve client library for remotely managing Sieve scripts,
        including an user application (the interactive 'sieveshell').
        
        Sieve scripts allow users to filter incoming email on the mail server.
        The ManageSieve protocol allows managing Sieve scripts on a remote
        mail server. These servers are commonly sealed so users cannot log
        into them, yet users must be able to update their scripts on them.
        This is what for the "ManageSieve" protocol is. For more information
        about the ManageSieve protocol see `the ManageSieve Internet draft
        <http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-martin-managesieve-07.txt>`_.
        
        This module allows accessing a Sieve-Server for managing Sieve scripts
        there. It is accompanied by a simple yet functional user application
        'sieveshell'.
        
        Changes since 0.4
        -----------------
          - fixed short read (thanks to paurkedal for submitting the patch)
          - Use ssl.wrap_socket() instead of deprecated socket.ssl().
            Thanks to Guido Berhoerster for submitting the patch.
        
        Changes since 0.3
        -----------------
        :managesieve:
          - now works with Python 2.3 and later
          - added support for TLS (STARTTLS), special thanks to Gregory Boyce
            for fixing some corner cases here
          - added support for PLAIN authentication
          - use optparse if available instead of optik.
          - API change: login() no longer uses the LOGIN authentication
            mechanism, but has become a convenience function. It uses the best
            mechanism available for authenticating the user.
          - Several Bugfixes, see HISTORY for details.
        
          Thanks to Tomas 'Skitta' Lindroos, Lorenzo Boccaccia, Alain Spineux,
          darkness and Gregory Boyce for sending patches.
        
        :sieveshell:
          - added support for different authentication mechanisms
          - added option --start-tls
          - several other enhancements and bugfixes
        
        Availability
        -------------

        Requirements
        ------------
        
        managesieve requires
        
        * `Python 2.x`__ or higher (tested with 2.5 and 2.6, but other
           versions should work, too, Python 3.x is *not* supported),
        * `logging`__ when using Python < 2.3 (`logging` is already
          included in Python 2.3 and higher)
        * `setuptools`__ or `distribute`__ for installation (see below)
        
        __ http://www.python.org/download/
        __ http://pypi.python.org/pypi/logging
        __ http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools
