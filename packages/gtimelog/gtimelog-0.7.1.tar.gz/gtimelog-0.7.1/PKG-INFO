        0.7.1 (2012-02-01)
        ==================
        * Fix reporting problems with non-ASCII characters when using
          gobject-introspection (LP: #785578).
        * Fix ^C not exiting the app when using gobject-introspection.
        * Implement panel icon color autodetection logic that was missing in the
          gobject-introspection case (LP: #924390).
        * New command-line option: --help.
        * New command-line option: --replace.  Requires that the running version
          support the new DBus method 'Quit', which was also added in this version.
        * Messages printed to stdout are prefixed by "gtimelog" (GUI app output often
          ends up in ~/.xsession-errors, it's polite to identify yourself when writing
          there).
        * DBus errors do not pass silently.
        
        
        0.7.0 (2011-09-21)
        ==================
        * Use gobject-introspection by default, using pygtk only as a fallback.  This
          will require a newer gir1.2-pango-1.0 than what's in Ubuntu Oneiric
          (LP: #855076) and still suffers from key presses being ignored
          (LP: #849732).  Unset the environment variable UBUNTU_MENUPROXY to work
          around the latter bug.
        * Rework the gi/pygtk imports so that only the minimum is wrapped in a
          try-except.
        * Use /usr/bin/env python in #! line, though this should be hard-coded to the
          installed version of Python in the Debian package.
        * Other code cleanup (e.g. use new-style classes via __metaclass__, remove
          ancient workaround for missing `set` built-in).
        
        
        0.6.1 (2011-09-20)
        ==================
        * Fix two crashes when using GI.  Given by Martin Pitt.
