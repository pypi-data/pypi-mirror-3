Introduction
============

It is simply to use, needs no desktop application, everything is done
through the web by uploading an "excel file" and configure its visualisations.

See also initial project wiki page https://svn.eionet.europa.eu/projects/Zope/wiki/DaViz
for the reasoning behind this project.


Main features
=============

EEA Daviz generates different views and a customisable faceted search on CSV/TSV data
uploaded in a Plone site. Just upload a CSV file under a normal Plone file and
go to actions menu and click convert to exhibit view, the page will automatically
refresh to edit the Exhibit view

Installation
============

To install eea.daviz into the global Python environment (or a workingenv),
using a traditional Zope 2 instance, you can do this:

 * When you're reading this you have probably already run
   ``easy_install eea.daviz``. Find out how to install setuptools
   (and EasyInstall) here:
   http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall

 * If you are using Zope 2.9 (not 2.10), get `pythonproducts`_ and install it
   via::

       python setup.py install --home /path/to/instance

   into your Zope instance.

 * Create a file called ``eea.daviz-configure.zcml`` in the
   ``/path/to/instance/etc/package-includes`` directory.  The file
   should only contain this::

       <include package="eea.daviz" />

.. _pythonproducts: http://plone.org/products/pythonproducts


Alternatively, if you are using zc.buildout and the plone.recipe.zope2instance
recipe to manage your project, you can do this:

 * Add ``eea.daviz`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.:

    [buildout]
    ...
    eggs =
        ...
        eea.daviz

  * Tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug:

    [instance]
    recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
    ...
    zcml =
        eea.daviz

  * Re-run buildout, e.g. with:

    $ ./bin/buildout

You can skip the ZCML slug if you are going to explicitly include the package
from another package's configure.zcml file.
