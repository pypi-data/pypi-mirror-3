js.jquery_globalize
*******************

Introduction
============

This library packages `jquery globalize`_ for `fanstatic`_.

.. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
.. _`jquery globalize`: http://github.com/jquery/globalize

This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
directory in ``js.jquery_globalize``) are published to some URL.
