        Changelog
        =========
        
        0.1 (2012-02-17)
        ----------------
        
        - Added ability to hit enter key within geocoder input and search. Previously,
          hitting enter submitted the parent form.
          [davidjb]
        - Restructure geocoder JavaScript so it happens on window.load (and wrap
          the usage of ``$``).
          [davidjb]
        - Execute map construction on window.load rather than when the JavaScript
          gets loaded.
          [davidjb]
        - Pass map id through to edit shape map JavaScript.
          [davidjb]
        - Remove dependency on jq object for edit shape map.
          [davidjb] 
        - Added ability to display a collective.geo map when outputting this widget
          in display mode.  Presents a layer with the field's value as its features. 
          [davidjb]
        - Initial release
