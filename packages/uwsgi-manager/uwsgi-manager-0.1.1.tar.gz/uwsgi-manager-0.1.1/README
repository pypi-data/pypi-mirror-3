uWSGI Manager

This is small python script for uWSGI instances. It can read your XML configuration and stop/reload/restart/start/what ever with your uWSGI processes. Originaly it was delevoped for Python hosting Rosti.cz, but parts of administration and tools are open now or will be opened soon. Script works only under root privileges.

Using:

	$ mkdir /etc/uwsgi
	$ vim /etc/uwsgi/config.xml
	[copy modified configuration below]
	$ uwsgi-manager.py -l
	$ uwsgi-manager.py -R 1

Config file /etc/uwsgi/config.xml:

	<your_server>
	<uwsgi id="48">
	        <pythonpath>/home/user/django/</pythonpath>
	        <master/>
	        <no-orphans/>
	        <processes>1</processes>
	        <optimize>0</optimize>
	        <home>/home/user/virtualenvs/default</home>
	        <limit-as>128</limit-as>
	        <chmod-socket>660</chmod-socket>
	        <uid>user</uid>
	        <gid>user</gid>
	        <pidfile>/home/user/uwsgi/django.pid</pidfile>
	        <socket>/home/user/uwsgi/django.sock</socket>
	        <wsgi-file>/home/user/django/django.wsgi</wsgi-file>
	        <daemonize>/home/user/uwsgi/django.log</daemonize>
	        <chdir>/home/user/django/</chdir>
	</uwsgi>
	</your_server>

I assume, you use same paths of uwsgi binaries as I:

	* /usr/bin/uwsgi
	* /usr/local/bin/uwsgi25
	* /usr/local/bin/uwsgi27
	* /usr/local/bin/uwsgi31
	* /usr/local/bin/uwsgi32

If you want to use another paths, you have to go into code.

If you are lost, try -h:

	$ ./uwsgi-manager.py -h
	Usage: uwsgi-manager.py [options]

	Options:
	  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
	  -s ID, --start=ID     Start app
	  -S ID, --stop=ID      Stop app (sig 9)
	  -r ID, --reload=ID    Reload app (sig 1)
	  -b ID, --brutal-reload=ID
	                        Brutal reload app (sig 15)
	  -R ID, --restart=ID   Restart app
	  -c ID, --check=ID     Check state of app
	  -a, --start-all       Start all apps
	  -A, --stop-all        Stop all apps
	  -w, --reload-all      Reload all apps
	  -W, --restart-all     Restart all apps
	  -B, --brutal-reload-all
	                        Brutal reload all apps
	  -l, --list            Print state of all apps
