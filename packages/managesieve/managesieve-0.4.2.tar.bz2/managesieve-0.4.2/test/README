managesieve 0.4.1
=================

A ManageSieve client library for remotely managing Sieve scripts,
including an user application (the interactive 'sieveshell').

Sieve scripts allow users to filter incoming email on the mail server.
The ManageSieve protocol allows managing Sieve scripts on a remote
mail server. These servers are commonly sealed so users cannot log
into them, yet users must be able to update their scripts on them.
This is what for the "ManageSieve" protocol is. For more information
about the ManageSieve protocol see `the ManageSieve Internet draft
<http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-martin-managesieve-07.txt>`_.

This module allows accessing a Sieve-Server for managing Sieve scripts
there. It is accompanied by a simple yet functional user application
'sieveshell'.

    for fixing some corner cases here
  - added support for PLAIN authentication
  - use optparse if available instead of optik.

    mechanism available for authenticating the user.
