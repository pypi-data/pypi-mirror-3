        Introduction
        ============
        
        This package adds the Embedly TinyMCE plugin to Plone.
        
        Currently based on version 2.0.9 of the source available in the
        `WordPress.org subversion repository
        <http://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/embedly/tags/2.0.9/>`_.
        
        This product was developed by `Netsight Internet Solutions Limited
        <http://www.netsight.co.uk>`_. Its official repository and bug tracker
        is at
        `http://github.com/collective/collective.tinymceplugins.embedly`.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Add the collective.tinymceplugins.embedly egg to your buildout.cfg and
        install using the QuickInstaller.
        
        Configuration
        =============
        
        To use the Embedly plugin on your site, you need to provide an API key
        (available from `embed.ly <http://embed.ly/>`_). You can set the API
        key by going to Site Setup -> Configuration Registry and setting the
        api_key value.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Usage is explained best on the `Embedly website <
        
        An video example of this product's usage in Plone can be found `on
        Vimeo <https://vimeo.com/40592731>`_.
        
        Alternatives
        ============
        
        This product can be used alongside `collective.embedly
        <http://github.com/collective/collective.embedly>`_ and
        `collective.oembed <http://github.com/collective/collective.oembed>`_.
        This is the only Plone add-on product of the 3 to include full TinyMCE
        integration.
        
        Dependencies
        ============
        
        collective.tinymceplugins.embedly currently depends on version 1.3dev
        or higher of `Products.TinyMCE
        <http://github.com/plone/Products.TinyMCE>`_. This is because the
        embed.ly TinyMCE plugin designed for WordPress is aimed at TinyMCE
        version 3.4.5 or higher.
