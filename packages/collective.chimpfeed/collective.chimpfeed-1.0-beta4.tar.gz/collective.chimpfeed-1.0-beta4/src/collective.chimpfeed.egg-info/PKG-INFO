Description: Overview
        ========
        
        This package makes it easy to designate content into one or more named
        feeds, suitable for creating automated newsletter content.
        
        It extends the base content schema for any Archetypes-based content
        which lets editors easily manage which feeds (if any) that a given
        item should be listed under.
        
        Designed for the `MailChimp <http://www.mailchimp.com>`_ internet
        service, the package also includes a subscription portlet that
        optionally lists a subset of interest groups.
