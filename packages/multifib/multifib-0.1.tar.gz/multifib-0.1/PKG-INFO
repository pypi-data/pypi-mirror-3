Description: 
        Multiple Fibonacci Number Implementations, in Python and C
        
        by Dan Crosta <dcrosta@late.am>
        
        This package implements four functions to generate the Nth fibonacci number:
        
        * a recursive algorithm in Python
        * an iterative algorithm in Python
        * and the same two algorithms in C as an extension module
        
        You shouldn't use this package. It's purpose is to serve as an example to
        support my "Python Packaging for Humans" presentation at PyGotham II on
        June 8, 2012 in New York City.
