        Konira - A Python DSL Testing Framework
        =======================================
        Konira is a tool that allows you to write minimalistic
        descriptions for testing scenarios and unit tests.
        
        It is flexible enough to accommodate Behavioral Driven
        Development as well as traditional Unit Testing.
        
        As a testing tool, it takes testing itself **seriously** and is tested
        and verified to work on
        
        * Python 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 3.0, 3.1 and 3.2
        * PyPy 1.5 and 1.6
        
        Konira's own test suite consists of about 200 tests that run in
        about ``0.120s``
        
        It provides a test runner, a dsl and you can optionally use ``py.test``
        to run these tests (using the ``pytest-konira`` plugin installed separately).
        
        If you develop with Vim editor, there is also a plugin that will enable
        syntax highlighting and running tests from within Vim (see:
        https://github.com/alfredodeza/konira.vim)
        
        
        
        What does a test case look like?
        ------------------------------------
        
        
        ::
        
        describe "a very simple test case for my_module":
        
        it "has a foo property that is True":
        assert my_module.foo
        
        
        But this is not valid Python!
        ---------------------------------
        
        I hear you. It is a DSL. All tests need to specify the ``konira`` encoding
        at the top and they can be executed with the included command line tool.
        
        fast and readable action in the terminal
        --------------------------------------------
        
        
        ::
        
        $ konira
        
        a very simple test case for my_module
        It has a foo property that is True
        
        
        All specs passed in 0.000 secs.

        The name
        ------------
        
        *Konira* is one of the names of an ancient Inca God. Konira Wirakocha diguised
        as a traveler in rags. A trickster, a prankster. No one knew who he was, and the
        people he passed called him names. Yet as he walked, he created. With a word he
        made the fields and terraced hillsides. Dropping a reed blossom, he made water flow.
        
        This is a DSL, it looks like Python - it mostly is, but it packs simplicity and makes
        testing look good and easy.
