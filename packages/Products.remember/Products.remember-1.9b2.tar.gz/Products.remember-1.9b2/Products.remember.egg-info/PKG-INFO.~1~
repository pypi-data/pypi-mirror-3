Description: ========
        Products.remember
        ========
        
        Products.remember is a full implementation of the default Plone member
        configuration using content to represent membership accounts.  It is built
        on top of Products.membrane.  Out of the box, Products.remember should work
        very much like a regular Plone membership accounts, except that member
        information is stored in Member objects that are (by default) stored in the
        portal_memberdata tool.
        
        Products.remember 1.9b1 works with Plone 4+ and Products.membrane 2+.  It
        does not suppport Plone 3 and Products.membrane 1.  See versions of
        Products.remember before 1.9, eg 1.1b3.  (Visit
        http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Products.remember for the index of all
        available Products.remember releases.)
        
        Products.remember is a successor to CMFMember, which will not work with
        PluggableAuthService-based user folders, and thus will not work with a
        typical Plone 2.5 (and greater) installation.  Products.remember 1.1b3
        provides a migration path for existing CMFMember-based sites.

        ============
        INSTALLATION
        ============
        
        Products.remember is packaged using Python's setuptools package management
        infrastructure.  Remember can be made available to your Zope instance by
        installing the Products.remember package into your Zope's python
        environment, using either easy_install or 'python setup.py install'.
        
        Products.remember is installed into a Plone site by the application of a
        GenericSetup extension profile.  You can do this when creating a new
        site by selecting remember from the list of available setup profiles
        when you are creating the site.  In an existing site, you can use
        Plone's regular product installation interface.
        
        ============
        REQUIREMENTS
        ============

        Changelog
        =========
        
        1.9b1 - 2011-06-14
        ------------------
        
        * Products.remember now can be installed in some portals without affecting
          the operation of the other portals in the same Zope instance.
          [may 2011 ken manheimer]
        
          Products.remember no longer disrupts non-membrane membership when
          Products.remember is present but not yet quick-installed.
          [march 2011 ken manheimer]
        
        * Products.remember can now be quick-uninstalled, so that Plain members can
          be created and operate properly.  The uninstall is not complete, however!
          The portal still depends on presence of the Products.remember code for
          proper operation, even when the product is not quick-installed.
        
          If Products.remember is subsequently re-installed, already-existing
          Products.remember accounts will resume working.  (You have to manually
          reindex the membrane_tool catalog to see the pre-existing accounts after
          reinstall.  Via the ZMI in your site's membrane_tool, select the
          'Advanced' tab and 'Update Catalog'.)
        
          Note also that, as of this writing, Products.membrane cannot be
          uninstalled without breaking the site - but that should not interfere
          with operation or creation of plain, non-membrane membership accounts.
          [may 2011 ken manheimer]
        
        * Respect Site Setup/Security/"Use email address as login name".
        
          New accounts are not allowed to have the same email address as already
          existing ones when the property is True, but the policy is not enforced
          when it is false.  (Already existing accounts are not subject to the
          constraint in either case.)
        
          This feature is essentially Maurits van Rees' maurits-emaillogin-pas
          email login branch, plus: added automatic activation of the PAS
          authentication plugin, connection so it's controlled by the security
          setup "Use email address as login name" setting, and update step so the
          plugin is activated when portals already using Products.remember are
          upgraded.
          [march 2011 ken manheimer]
        
        * Products.remember now depends on Products.membrane 2+ and Plone 4+.
        
          - Removed and/or converted "I*Avail" interfaces
          - Added missing BaseMember.getUserId() method
          - Make BaseMember Provide IMembraneUserAuth, so it can do
            .authenticateCredentials(), and
          - Implemented BaseMember.authenticateCredentials() method to be
            used instead of the version removed from membrane.
        
          NOTE WELL:
        
          If you have sites with pre-existing member objects you must update their
          membrane_tool catalog when you upgrade.  Via the ZMI in your site's
          membrane_tool, select the 'Advanced' tab and 'Update Catalog' to
          reconcile existing index entries.
          [march 2011 ken manheimer]
        
        * Modernized GenericSetup configuration, moving the profile and import
          step registration from python code and xml to zcml, and creating
          upgrade steps to get rid of persistent import steps and update the
          existing getRoles index from a FieldIndex to a KeywordIndex.
          [maurits]
        
        * Changed getRoles from a FieldIndex to a KeywordIndex in the
          membrane_tool, so you can search for roles.
          [maurits]
        
        * Use Plone 3's JS schemata/fieldset switching.

        1.1b3 - 2009-03-23
        ------------------
        
        * allow usage of portal_registration tools  ALLOWED_MEMBER_ID_PATTERN. This 
          does not change any current behaviour, it may be made configurable ttw in 
          future. Introduced new config.py variable USE_PORTAL_REGISTRATION_PATTERN
          set to False by default. Setting to True switches to portal_registrations
          getIDPattern.
          [2009-04-23 by jensens]
        
        * Fix inefficiency in prefs_users_overview where searchUsers is called when 
          no search string is supplied. The bug meant that the page would be extremely 
          slow even when just navigating to prefs_users_overview.
