Description: hourglass
        =========
        
        hourglass_ is a minimalist scheduler for rq_.
        
        ``hourglass`` provides a date-sorted queue class, ``Schedule``, that
        stores jobs that are to be run at some point in the future, and a
        daemon script, ``hourglass``, that delegates those jobs to the regular
        queues processed by ``rqworker`` processes.

        Usage
        -----
        
        Run the ``hourglass`` daemon script included with the package. Example
        usage::
        
            import times
            from datetime import timedelta
            from rq import use_connection
            from hourglass import Schedule
        
            def test_job(n):
                return n
        
            use_connection()
        
            s = Schedule()
        
            # schedule a job to be run 3 minutes from now
            eta = times.now() + timedelta(0, 180)
            job = s.enqueue(eta, test_job, 5)
        
        ``hourglass`` managed jobs include an additional property, ``eta``,
        which is the time passed as the first argument to ``Schedule.enqueue``
        and ``Schedule.enqueue_job``.  They also include another property,
        ``queue`` for specifying which queue to dispatch the job to when
        ``eta`` has elapsed.
        
        The ``Schedule`` queue and ``hourglass`` daemon use UTC times under the
        hood, so eta's passed to the scheduler should be in UTC as well.
