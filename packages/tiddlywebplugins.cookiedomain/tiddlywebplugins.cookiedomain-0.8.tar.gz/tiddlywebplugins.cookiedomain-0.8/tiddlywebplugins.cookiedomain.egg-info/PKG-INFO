Description: A TiddlyWeb plugin that modifies the tiddlyweb_user cookie to add a domain.
        
        The goal here is to allow auth in one subdomain to be useful
        in another.
        
        When installed as a system_plugin, any 'tiddlyweb_user' cookie
        produced lower down in the stack with a Set-Cookie will have
        a Domain attribute added with a value set from
        
        * config['cookie_domain']
        * config['server_host']['host']
        
        choosing the first if defined.
        
Platform: Posix; MacOS X; Windows
