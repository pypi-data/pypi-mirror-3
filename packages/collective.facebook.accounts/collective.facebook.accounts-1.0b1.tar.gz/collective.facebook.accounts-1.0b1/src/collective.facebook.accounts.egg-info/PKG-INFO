        Overview
        --------
        
        This product allows you to add Facebook accounts to a Plone site.
        
        It uses oAuth authentication.
        
        Prerequisites
        -------------
        
        Facebook accounts are added to the Plone site using a Facebook app. You can
        create your own from https://developers.facebook.com/apps. Make sure to write
        down the app's "App ID/API Key".
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        - Go to the "Site Setup", then to the "Facebook" tool.
        - Choose from the "Permissions" section, which permissions you'll need to use.
          You can get further info on each one, from
          https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/api/permissions/
        - Write the "App ID/API Key" from your Facebook app (see prerequisites).
        - Click on "Request user auth"
        - If your browser asks to, click on "Leave this page".
        - Login with the Facebook account you want to use.
        - Allow permission for the app.
        
        Done, you should now be back at your Plone site, and see your account listed
        in the "Accounts" section in the tool.
        
        An expiration date is included too.
        
        If you want to remove an account, simply click on its red cross next to its
        name. Be carefull, it will delete the account without confirmation, and it
        cannot be undone.
        
        Actually posting or getting to/from Facebook
        --------------------------------------------
        
        This product just saves the needed data in order to use the Facebook API.
        You'll need additional products in order to do so, for example
        "collective.facebook.portlets".
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        To enable this product in a buildout-based installation:
        
        1. Edit your buildout.cfg and add ``collective.facebook.accounts`` to the list
           of eggs to install ::
        
            [buildout]
            ...
            eggs =
                collective.facebook.accounts
        
        After updating the configuration you need to run ''bin/buildout'', which will
        take care of updating your system.
        
        Go to the 'Site Setup' page in a Plone site and click on the 'Add-ons' link.
        
        Check the box next to ''collective.facebook.accounts'' and click the
        'Activate' button.
        
        Note: You may have to empty your browser cache and save your resource
        registries in order to see the effects of the product installation.
