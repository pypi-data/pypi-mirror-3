About NeuronPy
==============

NeuronPy is a library of Python interfaces and utilities for the 
NEURON simulator and the analysis of neural data.

============
Requirements
============

NeuronPy may work with Python 2.5, but this has not been tested. Python 2.6 or higher
should be used. Many classes rely on Numpy 1.3 or greater.

Depending on your use of the library, other packages may be needed:

    * The NEURON simulator (http://www.neuron.yale.edu) version 7.2 or greater. 
    * Mercurial 1.3 or greater.

============
Installation
============

You can also try installing from the Python Package Index, Pypi.

    $ pip install neuronpy

or

    $ easy_install neuronpy

To get the source and install that way, with Mercurial installed:
    
    hg clone http://bitbucket.org/tommctavish/neuronpy

Alternatively, with a downloaded zip file extract the contents. 

To install from source, and with a terminal window in the neuronpy directory::

    $ python setup.py install

You may need to have administrator privileges for this step.
