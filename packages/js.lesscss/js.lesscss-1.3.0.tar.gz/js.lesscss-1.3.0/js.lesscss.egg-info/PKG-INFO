        Introduction
        ============
        
        This library packages `less`_ for `fanstatic`_.
        
        .. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
        .. _`less`: http://lesscss.org/
        
        This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
        and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
        directory in ``js.lesscss``) are published to some URL.
        
        Bitbucket repository : https://bitbucket.org/fanstatic/js.lesscss
        
        How to use?
        ===========
        
        
        You can import ``lesscss`` from ``js.lesscss`` and ``need`` it where you want
        these resources to be included on a page::
        
          >>> from js.lesscss import lesscss
          >>> lesscss.need()
        
        You need to use this resource with `bottom = true <http://fanstatic.org/configuration.html#bottom>`_ 
        option because ``less.js`` script need to be loaded after all ``.less`` files.
