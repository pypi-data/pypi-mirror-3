The package **cnolab.deploy** provides utilities that are of general usage
for cnolab packages. For instance, it provides the sphinx templates being used
for the documentation. It is also used by other packages where documentation
using Sphinx is being used (e.g., CNODocs, sampleModels)

For a full documentation, see the sphinx documentation in the ./doc directory.
