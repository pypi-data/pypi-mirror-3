DESCRIPTION 
 w2m is essentially a Python 2.7 module providing the W2M class. The W2M class
 is a www spider which explores a subset of the www, extracts the adjacency
 matrix of the oriented graph, and saves it as a GNU-Octave .mat file. If numpy
 and matplotlib are available, it computes the spectrum of the adjacency matrix
 and plots the result. The list of vertices and an image of the matrix are also
 produced. The file w2m.py can be used as a module or as a script handling
 command line arguments. W2M uses threading. W2M does not depend on modules
 outside the standard library, except numpy and matplotlib, which are optional.
 This makes more easy the possible 2to3 transition.
