Streaming and Fileutils libraries

Version 0.2: 2012-03-25
* Several errors were fixed, like UnicodeDecodeError for bstream and ustream
while using class inside the interpreter on Windows platform. Now you can use
bstream and ustream classes right inside the interpreter.
* Methods iter_chars() and iter_ints() were added to bstream and ustream
classes. These methods return list of characters (bytes or unicode) or list
of integers, where the each integer is a code for each character (like if you
use [ord(char) for char in stream], but a bit faster).
* Attributes '_bytes_' and '_unicode_' for bstream and ustream objects were
combined into '_stream_' attribute. It returns bytes object for bstream and
unicode object for ustream.
* __repr__ method of bstream and ustream was changed to more compact form.
* __repr__ method of fstream now includes information about the position
of the cursor.
* __unicode__ method was added to bstream and ustream objects, so it you can
now translate them to unicode by using unicode(stream) function.
