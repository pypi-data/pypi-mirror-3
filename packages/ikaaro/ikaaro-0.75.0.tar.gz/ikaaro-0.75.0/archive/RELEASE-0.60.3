ikaaro 0.60.3 (2009/06/17)
==========================

This is a Content Management System built on Python & itools, among
other features ikaaro provides:

 - content and document management (index&search, metadata, etc.)
 - multilingual user interfaces and content
 - high level modules: wiki, forum, tracker, etc.

The new script icms-forget.py reduces the history depth of the database.
This has been implemented to address scalability issues found with the
current usage of Git.

The icms-start.py script has the new option --read-only, which starts
the database in read-only mode.  The ability to start more than one
server at a time has been dropped from this script.

There have been two improvements to the edit views of several resources:
the upload form has been merged into the edit view, and now all edit
views manage edit conflicts.

Many bugs have been fixed, including #549, #612, #683, #701, #706, #716,
#718 and #719.
