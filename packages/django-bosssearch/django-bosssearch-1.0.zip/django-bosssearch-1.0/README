django-bosssearch
=================

Search the web or a specific domain in your Django project using the
Yahoo BOSS API.

Installation
============

First, add ``djangobosssearch`` to ``INSTALLED_APPS``

Using the BOSS API requires a key and a secret. Get them
from http://developer.yahoo.com/search/boss/ and add them to your
projects settings::

    BOSS_API_KEY = ''
    BOSS_API_SECRET = ''

Then include the views in your projects urlconf::

    urlpatterns = patterns('',
        url(r'^search/$', include('djangobosssearch.bosssearch_urls')),
    )

If you want the search to be limited to a certain domain add the following
to the settings::

    BOSS_SITE_SEARCH_DOMAIN = 'example.com'

Templates
=========

The templates provided are just an example. Pagination on the results page
(`bosssearch/results.html`) is done using
`django-pagination <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-pagination>`_.

Configuration
=============

Besides the previously mentioned configuration keys, the following options
are also useful if you use the provided urlpatterns and view.

``BOSS_SEARCH_MARKET``
The region (country) to search in (default: 'en-us').

``BOSS_RESULTS_PER_PAGE``
The number of results per page (default: 50).
