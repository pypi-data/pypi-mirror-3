"""Maildir runner.

Most MTAs can be configured to deliver messages to a `Maildir'[1].  This
runner will read messages from a maildir's new/ directory and inject them into
Mailman's qfiles/in directory for processing in the normal pipeline.  This
delivery mechanism contrasts with mail program delivery, where incoming
messages end up in qfiles/in via the MTA executing the scripts/post script
(and likewise for the other -aliases for each mailing list).

The advantage to Maildir delivery is that it is more efficient; there's no
need to fork an intervening program just to take the message from the MTA's
standard output, to the qfiles/in directory.

[1] http://cr.yp.to/proto/maildir.html

We're going to use the :info flag == 1, experimental status flag for our own
purposes.  The :1 can be followed by one of these letters:

- P means that MaildirRunner's in the process of parsing and enqueuing the
  message.  If successful, it will delete the file.

- X means something failed during the parse/enqueue phase.  An error message
  will be logged to log/error and the file will be renamed <filename>:1,X.
  MaildirRunner will never automatically return to this file, but once the
  problem is fixed, you can manually move the file back to the new/ directory
  and MaildirRunner will attempt to re-process it.  At some point we may do
  this automatically.

See the variable USE_MAILDIR in Defaults.py.in for enabling this delivery
mechanism.

# NOTE: Maildir delivery is experimental in Mailman 2.1, and untested in
# Mailman 3.  Instead, use LMTP delivery for Mailman 3.
