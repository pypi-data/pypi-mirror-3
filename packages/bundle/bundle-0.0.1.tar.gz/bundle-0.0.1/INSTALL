Installation
============

You can install ``bundle`` either via the Python Package Index (PyPI)
or from source.

To install using ``pip``,::

    $ pip install bundle


To install using ``easy_install``,::

    $ easy_install bundle


If you have downloaded a source tarball you can install it
by doing the following,::

    $ python setup.py build
    # python setup.py install # as root
