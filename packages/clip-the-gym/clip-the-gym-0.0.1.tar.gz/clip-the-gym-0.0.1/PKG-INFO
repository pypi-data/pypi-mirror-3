Description: `clip-the-gym` is just a script that:
        
          - takes a youtube url in your clipboard
          - tries to download it
          - extracts the audio in your ~/Music folder
        
        It makes a nice 'hotkey' in whatever window manager you're using.
        
        If you have notify-python installed, it will
        pop up nice messages for you.

        You'll need to have ``xsel`` on your system::
        
          $ sudo yum -y install xsel
        
        To install clip-the-gym itself:  ``$ pip install clip-the-gym``
