bolg
====

bolg is an extended version of Python's glob module. It allows for a small
amount of more features while still retaining the simplicity of glob. More
specifically, bolg mimics some of the features found in BASH's globbing
algorithm.

Extensive documentation is included in the library. To view it, run ``pydoc3
bolg``.
