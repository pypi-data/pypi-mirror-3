Description: turses: a Twitter client written in Python
        ==========================================
        
        A Twitter client with a curses interface written in Python. Various parts of the codebase 
        are borrowed from the `Tyrs`_ project by `Nicolas Paris`_.
        
        .. _`Tyrs`: http://tyrs.nicosphere.net
        .. _`Nicolas Paris`: http://github.com/Nic0
        
        The goal of the project is to build a full-featured Twitter client:
        
        - one that is fully  customizable;
        - usable with multiple UIs (curses, gtk, qt, etc.); 
        - plugged to different API backends (currently is using `python-twitter`_); and 
        - having all the Twitter API capabilities with some spice.

        Development
        -----------
        
        **turses** is still a work in progress, a list of tasks can be found on 
        the TODO file. Eventually every task will reside in the repository's 
        `issue tracker`_. 
        
        .. _`issue tracker`: http://github.com/alejandrogomez/turses/issues
        
        The branch in which I do most of the development is `develop`, I merge to `master`
        when the code is ready for a release and I use extra branches for working in particular 
        tasks. If you want to hack with turses, branch-off `develop` or work there and
        send a pull request.
