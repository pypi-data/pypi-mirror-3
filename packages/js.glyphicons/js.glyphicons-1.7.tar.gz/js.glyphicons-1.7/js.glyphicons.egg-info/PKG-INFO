        Introduction
        ============
        
        This library packages `GLYPHICONS`_ for `fanstatic`_.
        
        .. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
        .. _`GLYPHICONS`: http://glyphicons.com/
        
        This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
        and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
        directory in ``js.glyphicons``) are published to some URL.
        
        .icon-search
        {: .icon-search}
        
        [a special url](/my-special-place.html){: .special}
        
        How to use?
        ===========
        
        
        You can import ``glyphicons`` from ``js.glyphicons`` and ``need`` it where you want
        these resources to be included on a page::
        
          >>> from js.glyphicons import glyphicons
          >>> glyphicons.need()
