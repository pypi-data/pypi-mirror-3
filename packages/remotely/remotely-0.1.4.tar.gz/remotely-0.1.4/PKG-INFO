Description: Remotely
        ========
        Remotely is a simple and secure remote code execution api.
        You start the remotely server on the box where you want to execute code.
        
        ::
        
            from remotely import create_remotely_server
            server = create_remotely_server("YOUR_API_KEY", PORT)
            server.serve_forever()
            ...
        
        And you use the remotely decorater for any function you want to run remotely.
        
        ::
        
            from remotely import remotely
        
            @remotely("YOUR_API_KEY", SERVER, PORT)
            def remote_code():
                # do something here
                return result
        
            # function will be executed on the remote server
            remote_code()
