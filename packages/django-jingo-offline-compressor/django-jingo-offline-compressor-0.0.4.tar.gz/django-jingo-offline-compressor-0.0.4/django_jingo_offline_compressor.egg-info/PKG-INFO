        For elitists (e.g. me) who use
        [jingo](https://github.com/jbalogh/jingo) to connect jinja2 with
        Django a major drawback is that you can't do offline compression if
        you use
        [django_compressor](https://github.com/jezdez/django_compressor).     
        
        The `compress` command that comes with `django_compressor` only works
        for regular Django templates. :( 
        Note though, that you can happily use `jingo` with `django_compressor`
        but it only works its magic during runtime. This package aims to solve
        that with a new command called `compress_jingo`.  
        
        To install
        ----------
        
        First install it by:
        
        ```
        pip install django-jingo-offline-compressor
        ```
        
        To start with, this assumes that you have `django_compressor` and
        `jingo` set up and working. 
        
        Add `jingo_offline_compressor` to your `INSTALLED_APPS`.
        
        To run
        ------
        
        Just like you'd run regular `django_compressor` you now run:
        
        ```
        ./manage.py compress_jingo
        ```
        
        And remember, unless you have `COMPRESS_OFFLINE = True` in your
        settings you might have to do: 
        
        ```
        ./manage.py compress_jingo --force
        ```
        
        That should now have created all the minified and concatenated files
        in your `STATIC_ROOT` in a sub-directory called `CACHE`.   
        
        **Note:** If you have other apps in `INSTALLED_APPS` that have been
        added to `JINGO_EXCLUDE_APPS` some of their templates might actually
        be included in warnings when you run `compress_jingo`. Just ignore at
        will.     
        
        What's next
        -----------
        
        It's early days but hopefully if this stabilize and prove its
        existence. Hopefully it can lead to a decent refactor and to have
        tests so it can be patched upstream to `django_compressor`. Hint hint
        @jezdez, keep an eye on me :)
