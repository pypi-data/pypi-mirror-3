Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This package extends standard ``Plone`` byline viewlet with publication date.
        
        
        Overview
        --------
        
        This is how this enhanced byline viewlet works. In case object is published then
        publication date is displayed: ``published <date>``. If object is not published
        then only modification date shows up: ``last modified <date>``. In case object
        is published and modified afterwards then both dates appear in byline viewlet:
        ``published <date>, last modified <date>``.
        
        All other byline elements left intact.
        
        
        Compatibility
        -------------
        
        This add-on was tested in Plone 4.0.
        
        
        Installation
