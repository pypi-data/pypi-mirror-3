Fast Model support for LAVA
===========================

This package contains low level code for managing fast models in LAVA.
Currently it is designed to manage NFS mounts, setting up the root filesystem
(exporting the provided tarball to the mount point and blessing it with
fast-model specific changes, if required). It also contains code for starting
the fast model runtime, monitoring execution and eventual shutdown (or forced
shutdown, if required).

Support for lava-serial plugin is being considered (to be able to get a
LAVA-Serial access to a running fast model emulation)
