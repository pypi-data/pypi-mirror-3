Description: ## Also
        Ever had lots of methods that do the same thing?!
        You want to set them to the same thing but dont want to do something lame like
        ```python
           def method(self):
               pass
        
           othermethod = method
        ```
        
        Rather you want to do it with style like
        
        ```python
           @also('othermethod')
           def method(self):
               pass
        ```
        
        Then do I have a solution for you!
