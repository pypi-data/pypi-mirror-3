Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        ``django-lazysignup`` is a package designed to allow users to interact with a
        site as if they were authenticated users, but without signing up. At any time,
        they can convert their temporary user account to a real user account.
        
        ``django-lazysignup`` is beta software. Bug reports, patches and extensions
        are welcomed. While this package is in beta, backwards-compatibility will be
        maintained for a single point release and a DeprecationWarning issued.
        
        Requirements
        ============
        
        Tested on Django 1.2.x, though should work on Django 1.0 and later
        (although you  will need to customise one of the templates.) It requires
        ``django.contrib.auth`` to be in the ``INSTALLED_APPS`` list.
        
        Note that from 0.9.0, Django 1.3 or later will be required.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        django-lazysignup can be installed with your favourite package management tool
        from PyPI::
        
          pip install django-lazysignup
        
        Once that's done, you need to add ``lazysignup`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS``.
        You will also need to add ``lazysignup``'s authentication backend to your
        site's ``AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS`` setting::
        
          AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = (
            'django.contrib.auth.backends.ModelBackend',
            'lazysignup.backends.LazySignupBackend',
          )
        
        If you are using Django prior to 1.2, you should override the
        ``lazysignup/convert.html``  template to remove the ``{% csrf_token %}``
        template tag. This may be handled more elegantly in a future release.
        
        Next, you need to ensure that the tables that ``lazysignup`` uses are created.
        You should either run ``python manage.py syncdb``, or use the South support
        and run ``python manage.py migrate lazysignup``.
        
        Finally, you need to add lazysignup to your URLConf, using something like
        this::
        
          urlpatterns += (''
              (r'^convert/', include('lazysignup.urls')),
          )
        
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        The package works by creating temporary user accounts based on a user's
        session key whenever a flagged view is requested. You can specify which
        views trigger this behaviour using the ``lazysignup.decorators.allow_lazy_user``
        decorator.
        
        When an anonymous user requests such a view, a temporary user account will be
        created for them, and they will be logged in. The user account will have
        an unusable password set, so that it can't be used to log in as a regular
        user. The way to tell a regular use from a temporary user is to call
        the ``is_lazy_user()`` function from ``lazysignup.templatetags.lazysignup_tags``.
        If this returns ``True``, then the user is temporary. Note that
        ``user.is_anonymous()`` will return ``False``  and ``user.is_authenticated()``
        will return ``True``. See below for more information on ``is_lazy_user``.
        
        A view is provided to allow such users to convert their temporary account into
        a real user account by providing a username and a password.
        
        A Django management command is provided to clear out stale, uncoverted user
        accounts - although this depends on your use of database-backed sessions, and
        assumes that all user accounts with an expired session are safe to delete. This
        may not be the case for all apps, so you may wish to provide your own cleaning
        script.
        
        The ``allow_lazy_user`` decorator
        ---------------------------------
        
        Use this decorator to indicate that accessing the view should cause anonymous
        users to have temporary accounts created for them.
        
        For example::
        
          from django.http import HttpResponse
          from lazysignup.decorators import allow_lazy_user
        
          @allow_lazy_user
          def my_view(request):
            return HttpResponse(request.user.username)
        
        When accessing the above view, a very simple response containing the generated
        username will be displayed.
        
        The ``is_lazy_user`` template filter
        ------------------------------------
        
        This template filter (which can also be imported from ``lazysignup.utils``
        and used in your own code) will return True if the user is a generated user.
        You need to pass it the user to test. For example, a site navigation
        template might look like this::
        
            {% load i18n lazysignup_tags %}
        
            <nav id="account-bar">
              <ul>
                <li><a href="{% url home %}">{% trans "Home" %}</a></li>
                {% if not user|is_lazy_user %}
                  <li><a href="#">{% trans "Account" %}</a></li>
                  <li><a href="{% url auth_logout %}">{% trans "Log out" %}</a></li>
                {% else %}
                  <li><a href="{% url lazysignup_convert %}">{% trans "Save your data" %}</a> {% trans "by setting a username and password" %}</li>
                {% endif %}
              </ul>
            </nav>
        
        This filter is very simple, and can be used directly in view code, or tests. For example::
        
            from lazysignup.utils import is_lazy_user
        
            def testIsLazyUserAnonymous(self):
                user = AnonymousUser()
                self.assertEqual(False, is_lazy_user(user))
        
        Note that as of version 0.6.0, the user tested no longer needs to have been
        authenticated by the ``LazySignupBackend`` for lazy user detection to work.
        
        User agent blacklisting
        -----------------------
        
        The middleware will not created users for certain requests from blacklisted
        user agents. This is simply a fairly crude method for preventing many spurious
        users being created by passing search engines.
        
        The blacklist is specified with the ``USER_AGENT_BLACKLIST`` setting. This
        should be an iterable of regular expression strings. If the user agent string
        of a request matches a regex (``search()`` is used, so the match can be anywhere
        in the string) then a user will not be created.
        
        If the list is not specified, then the default is as follows
        
          - slurp
          - googlebot
          - yandex
          - msnbot
          - baiduspider
        
        Specifying your own ``USER_AGENT_BLACKLIST`` will replace this list.
        
        Using the convert view
        ----------------------
        
        Users will be able to visit the ``/convert/`` view. This provides a form with
        a username, password and password confirmation. As long as they fill in valid
        details, their temporary user account will be converted into a real user
        account that they can log in with as usual.
        
        You may pass your own form class into the `convert` view in order to customise
        user creation. The code requires expects the following:
        
          - It expects to be able to create the form passing in the generated ``User``
            object with an ``instance`` kwarg (in general, this is fine when using a
            ModelForm based on the User model)
          - It expects to be able to call ``save()`` on the form to convert the user
            to a real user
          - It expects to be able to call a ``get_credentials()`` method on the form
            to obtain a set of credentials to authenticate the new user with. The
            result of this call should be a dictionary suitable for passing to
            ``django.contrib.auth.authenticate()``. Typically, this would be a dict
            with ``username`` and ``password`` keys - but this may vary if you're using
            a different authentication backend.
        
        The default configuration, using the provided ``UserCreationForm``, should
        be enough for most users, but the customisation point is there if you need
        it.
        
        The view also supports ``template_name`` and ``ajax_template_name`` arguments,
        to specify templates to render in web and ajax contexts respectively.
        
        The ``converted`` signal
        ------------------------
        
        Whenever a temporary user account is converted into a real user account, the
        ``lazysignup.signals.converted`` signal will be sent.  If you need to do any
        processing when an account is converted, you should listen for the signal, eg::
        
            from lazysignup.signals import converted
            from django.dispatch import receiver
        
            @receiver(converted)
            def my_callback(sender, **kwargs):
                print "New user account: %s!" % kwargs['user'].username
        
        The signal provides a single argument, ``user``, which contains the
        newly-converted User object.
        
        Custom User classes
        -------------------
        
        Many projects use a custom ``User`` class, augmenting that from
        ``django.contrib.auth``. If you want to use such a custom class with
        ``lazysignup``, then you should set the ``LAZYSIGNUP_USER_MODEL`` setting.
        This should be a standard dotted Django name for a model, eg::
        
            LAZYSIGNUP_USER_MODEL = 'myapp.CustomUser'
        
        The setting defaults to ``auth.User``, so using Django's own ``User`` model.
        
        If you do use a custom user class, note that ``lazysignup`` expects that
        class' default manager to have a ``create_user`` method, with the same
        signature and semantics as ``django.contrib.auth.models.UserManager``. If your
        model actually subclasses Django's own user model, you may well be able to
        use this manager directly. For example::
        
            from django.contrib.auth.models import User, UserManager
        
            class MyCustomUser(User):
                objects = UserManager()
        
                notes = models.TextField(blank=True, null=True)
        
        ``lazysignup`` also expects that it can fetch instances of your custom user
        class using a ``get`` method on the object's manager, and that looking them
        up by primary key and by ``username`` will work. See ``lazysignup.backends``
        for more detail.
        
        Maintenance
        -----------
        
        Over time, a number of user accounts that haven't been converted will build up.
        To avoid performance problems from an excessive number of user accounts, it's
        recommended that the ``remove_expired_users`` management command is run on
        a regular basis. It runs from the command line::
        
          python manage.py remove_expired_users
        
        In a production environment, this should be run from cron or similar.
        
        This works be removing user accounts from the system whose associated sessions
        have expired. ``user.delete()`` is called for each user, so related data will
        be removed as well.
        
        Note of course that these deletes will cascade, so if you need to keep data
        associated with such users, you'll need to write your own cleanup job. If
        that's not the case, then you'll again need to write your own cleanup.
        Finally, if you're using a custom user class where the user isn't a subclass
        of Django's own user model, you'll again need your own cleanup script.
        
        Helping Out
        -----------
        
        If you want to add a feature or fix a bug, please go ahead! Fork the project
        on GitHub, and when you're done with your changes, let me know. Fixes and
        features with tests have a greater chance of being merged. To run the tests,
        do::
        
          cd /path/to/src/lazysignup
          python manage.py test lazysignup
        
        Note that the tests require the ``mock`` package.
        
        
        Changelog
        =========
        
        0.10.0
        ------
        
        This is a feature release. Two new decorators have been added:
        `@require_lazy_user` and `@require_nonlazy_user`.
        
        Thanks to Brad Beattie (bradbeattie) for the implementation and tests, and to
        Adam Coddington (latestrevision) for the original suggestion.
        
        
        0.9.0
        -----
        
        This is a feature release. A custom signal is now fired when a user is
        converted. Thanks to Olly Smith (oesmith) for the patch.
        
        Versions of Django earlier than 1.3 are now no longer supported. (Nothing has
        been done to prevent 1.2.x working, but I will no longer take care to make sure
        that this remains the case.)
        
        
        0.8.0
        -----
        
        This is a feature release. This contains all the features in the 0.8.0 beta
        series, plus the ability to specify custom templates for the convert view,
        both via a regular GET and via Ajax. Thanks to percyperez for the idea and
        initial implementation.
        
        Note that this release is the last feature release that will support Django
        1.2 or earlier. 0.9.0 and later will require Django 1.3 or later.
        
        
        0.8.0b2
        -------
        
        This release introduces the following backwards-incompatible changes:
        
        * A test project was added to make running the tests a little easier. The old
          way of running the tests has been removed.
        * The `urls.py` no longer hardcodes `convert` as the URL prefix (thanks
          to mitar)
        
        0.8.0b1
        -------
        
        This is a bugfix and feature release. The internal API has changed to no
        longer depend on session keys for username generation. This should be
        backwards-compatible as long as you are using the documented API.
        
        The following bugs have been fixed:
        
        * PEP8 cleanups
        * Tweak setup.py to make sure templates are installed (thanks Kurt Grandis)
        
        The following features have been added:
        
        * Removed the hard dependency on session keys to generate usernames, as it was
          unnecessary.
        * remove_expired_users should no longer depend on using the database session
          backend - it will instead use SESSION_COOKIE_AGE to find lazy users
          who have not logged in recently and whose sessions will therefore have
          expired.
        
        You should still not use remove_expired_users without reviewing the code;
        in particular, you may wish to subclass the command and override
        `to_delete()`.
        
        These changes are somewhat experimental, so this is a beta release - it is
        *not* recommended that you run this in production. Testing and feedback is
        welcome.
        
        0.7.0
        -----
        
        This is a feature release. Custom user classes are now supported via the
        ``LAZYSIGNUP_USER_MODEL`` setting. This is a backwards-compatible change.
        
        Thanks to Luke Zapart for the idea and initial implementation.
        
        0.6.2
        -----
        
        This is a bugfix release. Issues fixed:
        
        * The LazySignupBackend no longer relies on a specific User class to
          authenticate a user. It now uses the fact that there is a relationship
          between the LazyUser and the main site User class. This fixes the bug
          where authenticate() was looking directly for UNUSABLE_PASSWORD, and also
          paves the way for custom user classes.
        
        0.6.1
        -----
        
        This is a bugfix release. Issues fixed:
        
        * https://github.com/danfairs/django-lazysignup/issues#issue/2 - Invalid user
          IDs in the session could cause an AttributeError from the auth backend.
        
        Thanks to Alex Ehlke for the report and patch.
        
        0.6.0
        -----
        
        This is a feature release:
        
        * Users created lazily but not currently logged-in are now correctly detected
          as lazy users. To facilitate this, a ``LazyUser`` model is included. Note
          that existing code using ``is_lazy_user`` only on authenticated users will
          continue to work, as the old method of checking the ``backend`` attribute
          of the ``User`` object has been retained - it's faster to do that than a
          potentially unnecessary database query.
        
          For those who use it, a South migration is provided to create the initial
          table. Data migration will be handled by South migrations from now on.
        
        * The canonical import location of ``is_lazy_user`` has changed from within
          ``lazysignup.templatetags.lazysignup_tags`` to ``lazysignup.utils``.
          Existing code that imports from the old location will continue to work.
        
        0.5.1
        -----
        
        Bugfix release:
        
        - Fix an issue where a lazy user would be misidentified as a non-lazy user
        
        0.5.0
        -----
        
        This version simplifies the implementation significantly by removing the requirement for
        a middleware. This is a backwards-incompatible change as the ``lazysignup.middleware``
        module no longer exists, and needs to be removed from your ``MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES`` list.
        
        This change means that you can no longer disable the software by removing the middleware
        class from your configuration. You might want to do this temporarily in development, for
        example, when testing that your views still work when an anonymous user is presented to
        them (perhaps through the user agent blacklisting functionality).
        
        To this end, support for a new settings has been added: ``ENABLE_LAZYSIGNUP``. It's set
        to True by default. Setting it to False will both prevent automatic login and
        automatic user creation.
        
        The ``allow_lazy_user`` decorator no longer has to be first in the decorator list. Thanks
        to Jauco Noordzij for pointing this out initially.
        
        There is now also an ``is_lazy_user`` template filter, which will return True if the
        current user is an automatically created user. It will return False for users who are
        anonymous, or were authenticated by some other means. Thanks again to Jauco Noordzij
        for the idea for this feature.
        
        Note that the ``is_lazy_user`` filter (which you can also just import and use
        directly in your view code) is the preferred way of checking for an automatically
        created user. ``has_usable_password`` will continue to return False for such users,
        but is no longer the canonical way to identify them. Users authenticated with
        other authentication backends (for example, LDAP backends) may return False when
        ``has_usable_password`` is called.
        
        
        0.4.0
        -----
        
        This version fixes a number of issues, adds new features and has backwards-
        incompatible changes:
        
          - Fix a RST issue in README
          - Fix an issue where a POST to the convert view would break if the user was anonymous.
            The convert view now redirects to the LOGIN_URL by default, parameterised in the view.
        
        New features:
        
          - It is now easier to customise the process of converting a lazy user into a real user.
            Previous versions allowed a custom form to be passed to the ``convert`` view, but the
            code always expected a ``username`` and ``password1`` field to get credentials from to
            log the user in. Now, a new ``get_credentials()`` method is called on the form to obtain
            these credentials.
          - The tests module now includes a ``no_lazysignup`` decorator that you can apply to a
            method on your test case, which removes the lazy signup middleware for the duration
            of that test only. This is useful for testing what happens when a view that is
            marked with with the ``allow_lazy_user`` decorator ends up with an anonymous user
            (most commonly, when a search engine visits).
        
        Backwards-incompatible changes:
        
          - Generated usernames are now based on the session key, rather than actually being the
            session key. This is to avoid a potential security issue where an app might simply
            display a username, giving away a significant part of the user's session key. The
            username is now generated from a SHA1 hash of the session key. This change means that
            existing generated users will become invalid.
        
        0.3.0
        -----
        
        This version introduces a backwards-incompatible changes, renaming the ``@allow_lazy``
        decorator to ``@allow_lazy_user``. This is to avoid confusion with the decorator of
        the same name in ``django.utils.functional``.
        
        0.2.0
        -----
        
        This version fixes a number of issues:
        
          - Correct a duplicated test
          - Fix a bug where a new user would not be created if they already had a
            session key.
        
        It also introduces a new feature, user agent blacklisting. This aims to
        prevent explosive growth in the number of users created by search engines,
        etc. This feature is still in test, so patches and feedback welcome. Note that
        this introduces a backwards-incompatibly behaviour. Prior to this release,
        it was safe to assume that all views marked with the ``@allow_lazy`` decorator
        would receive an authenticated user. This is now no longer the case.
