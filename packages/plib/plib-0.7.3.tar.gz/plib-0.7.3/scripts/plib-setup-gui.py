SETUP-GUI script for Package PLIB
Copyright (C) 2008-2012 by Peter A. Donis

This script determines what GUI toolkits are present on the system,
and writes a _setup.py module to the plib.gui directory that defines
appropriate constants. This module is then loaded by the main gui module
to determine which toolkits are available for use. The script should be
run after the sub-packages for PLIB are installed, since it uses some of
them.

Note that this script should only need to be run on initial installation
of PLIB or when toolkit packages are installed or uninstalled.
