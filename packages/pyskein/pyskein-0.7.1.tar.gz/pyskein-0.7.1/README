PySkein 0.7.1
=============

This file only covers some basic installation instructions. For any further
information please consult the docs, starting with "doc/index.html".


Installation
------------

Notes:
    * You need Python 3.0 or later to run PySkein!

    * If you have a version of PySkein <0.5 installed, please make sure to
      manually delete "skein.*" from your Python site-packages directory before
      installing a more recent version!

    * All versions of PySkein <0.5 compute Skein hashes according to an older
      specification of Skein (version 1.1). Starting with PySkein 0.5, hashes
      are computed according to the current specification with updated rotation
      constants (version 1.2). This leads to different hash outputs.

To build and install globally run (with appropriate permissions):

$ python3 setup.py install

To install locally (into your home directory or similar) run:

$ python3 setup.py install --user

The setup script will also install the two demo scripts "skeinsum" and
"threefish" into a corresponding location.
