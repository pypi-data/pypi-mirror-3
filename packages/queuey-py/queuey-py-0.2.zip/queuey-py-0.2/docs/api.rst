:mod:`queuey_py.client`
-----------------------

Contains a :term:`Queuey` connection helper.

The connection automatically handles retries on connection timeouts and fall
back to alternate :term:`Queuey` servers on SSL or connection errors. If
multiple servers are provided, one will be selected at random, though
`localhost` or a `127.0.0.1` / `::1` server will be preferred. Currently fall
back to secondary servers happens exactly once per server, after which it is
considered inactive. You have to make a new connection to reset the inactive
status.

The connection uses a connection pool as provided by the
`requests <http://docs.python-requests.org>`_ library and turns on keep alive
connections. SSL is supported by default and certificates will be checked for
validity. If you want to use a private certificate, you can configure one
via providing the full path to it in the `REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE` environment
variable.
