This file contains more detailed doctests for the stdnum.luhn module. It
tries to test more corner cases and detailed functionality that is not
really useful as module documentation.

>>> from stdnum import luhn


These are normal variations that should just work. Calculating checksums:

>>> luhn.checksum('4992739871')
9
>>> luhn.checksum('490154203237518')
0
>>> luhn.checksum('abcdefe', alphabet='abcdef')
0


The same numbers but now simply ask for validation:

>>> luhn.is_valid('4992739871')
False
>>> luhn.is_valid('490154203237518')
True
>>> luhn.is_valid('abcdefe', alphabet='abcdef')
True

Adding a check digit to the numbers so they are all valid:

>>> luhn.calc_check_digit('4992739871')
'6'
>>> luhn.is_valid('49927398716')
True
>>> luhn.calc_check_digit('142857')
'2'
>>> luhn.is_valid('1428572')
True
>>> luhn.calc_check_digit('398438246238642378648236487236482734')
'7'
>>> luhn.is_valid('3984382462386423786482364872364827347')
True
