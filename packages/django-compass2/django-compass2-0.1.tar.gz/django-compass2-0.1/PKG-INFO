        django-compass2
        ==================
        
        **django-compass2** is a re-usable Django application which provides an easy way of
        compiling your `Compass`_ or `Sass`_ based stylesheets to CSS. Its main
        benefit is Django settings integration, so you don't need lots of ``compass.rb``
        configuration files lying around (especially with multiple deployments, et
        cetera). Other than that, it's simply a proxy to the ``compass`` command-line
        application.

        Installation and Setup
        ============================
        
        *   You'll need to install `Compass`_; this is a Ruby library, so use the ``gem``
            utility (installed out-of-the-box on most systems)::
        
                $ [sudo] gem install compass --pre
        
        *   Then, just use ``pip`` or ``easy_install`` to install ``django-compass2`` (the
            dependencies will be handled automatically)::
        
                $ pip install django-compass2 # OR
                $ easy_install django-compass2
                
        *   Add ``'djcompass'`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting.
        
        *   In your ``settings.py`` file, add the necessary settings. Take a look at the
            configuration reference below for more information, but here's a quick
            example::
            
                COMPASS_INPUT = PROJECT_ROOT + 'media/sass'
                COMPASS_OUTPUT = PROJECT_ROOT + 'media/css'
                COMPASS_STYLE = 'compact'
                COMPASS_REQUIRES = (
                    'ninesixty',  # 960.gs Grid System
                )
        
        *   You can now compile your Sass with the management command::
        
                $ python manage.py compass
        
        
        Usage
        ============
        
        The command-line interface is very simple. 
        To see available options and commands try::
        
            $ python manage.py compass --help
        
        Basically the syntax is as simple as::
        
            $ python manage.py compass <primary_command>
        
        Just compile your Sass into CSS::
        
            $ python manage.py compass
               exists media/css
            unchanged media/sass/style.sass
        
        The above command is more or less equivalent to invoking::
        
            compass --sass-dir media/sass --css-dir media/css --output-style compact
        
        Monitor your Sass continuously::
        
            $ python manage.py compass watch
            >>> Compass is watching for changes. Press Ctrl-C to Stop.
            >>> Change detected to: .../media/sass/style.sass
            overwrite media/css/style.css
            ...
        
        Which is something like::
        
            compass --sass-dir media/sass --css-dir media/css --output-style compact --watch
        
        Configuration Reference
        ==========================
        
        Django Settings
        -----------------
        
        These should go in your ``settings.py`` file.
        
        
        Required settings
        ```````````````````````
        
        *   ``COMPASS_INPUT``: The directory where you keep your Sass/Scss stylesheets.
        
        *   ``COMPASS_OUTPUT``: The directory to which Compass should output CSS.
        
        Note that neither of these should have trailing slashes. They may be absolute or
        relative paths; if relative, they will be resolved against the current working
        directory.
        
        
        Optional settings
        ````````````````````````
        
        *   ``COMPASS_EXECUTABLE``: Path for your compass binary. Defaults to "compass"
        
        *   ``COMPASS_STYLE``: One of ``'nested'``, ``'expanded'``, ``'compact'`` or
            ``'compressed'``, specifying the style of the produced CSS output. The default
            is ``'compact'``.
        
        *   ``COMPASS_REQUIRES``: A sequence of Ruby libraries to ``require`` before running
            Compass commands.
        
        *   ``COMPASS_IMAGE_DIR``: The directory where images are stored (used for
            Compass's asset URL helpers).
        
        *   ``COMPASS_SCRIPT_DIR``: The directory containing your JavaScript files (used
            for Compass's asset URL helpers).
        
        *   ``COMPASS_RELATIVE_URLS``: Boolean specifying whether or not Compass's asset
            URL helpers should generate relative URLs.
        
        
        Command-line Options
        ------------------------
        
        These options may be passed at runtime to affect how Compass is run.
        
        *   ``-t``, ``--trace``: Print a full stacktrace on Compass errors.
