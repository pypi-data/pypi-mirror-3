Description: sandboxie is a Python interface to `Sandboxie <http://sandboxie.com>`_.
        
        
        Quickstart
        ----------
        
        ::
        
            >>> import sandboxie
            >>> sbie = sandboxie.Sandboxie()
        
        Create a sandbox::
        
            >>> sbie.create_sandbox(box='foo', options={'Enabled': 'yes'})
        
        Start a sandboxed process::
        
            >>> sbie.start('notepad.exe', box='foo', wait=False)
        
        Get sandboxed processes::
        
            >>> for pid in sbie.running_processes(box='foo'):
            >>>     print(pid)
            3
            15688
            5716
            26916
        
        Terminate sandboxed processes::
        
            >>> sbie.terminate_processes(box='foo')
        
        Delete the contents of a sandbox::
        
            >>> sbie.delete_contents(box='foo')
        
        Destroy a sandbox::
        
            >>> sbie.destroy_sandbox(box='foo')
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        The preferred way is to use pip_::
        
            $ pip install sandboxie
        
        You can also use ``easy_install``, but it's discouraged.
        
        .. _pip: http://pip-installer.org
        
        
        Supported Python versions
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Python 2.7 and 3.2 are currently supported from a single codebase, without 2to3
        translation.
        
        
        Contribute
        ----------
        
        The code repository is on GitHub: https://github.com/gg/sandboxie-py.
        
        To contribute:
        
        #. Work on an `open issue`_ or submit a new issue to start a discussion around
           a bug or feature request.
        
            * When submitting a bug, ensure your description includes the following:
                - the version of ``sandboxie`` used
                - any relevant system information, such as your operating system
                - steps to produce the bug (so others could reproduce it)
        
        #. Fork `the repository`_ and add the bug fix or feature to the **develop**
           branch.
        #. Write tests that demonstrate the bug was fixed or the feature works as
           expected.
        #. Submit a pull request and bug the maintainer until your contribution gets
           merged and published :-) You should also add yourself to AUTHORS_.
        
        .. _the repository: https://github.com/gg/sandboxie-py
        .. _open issue: https://github.com/gg/sandboxie-py/issues
        .. _AUTHORS: https://github.com/gg/sandboxie-py/blob/develop/AUTHORS.rst
        
        
        Running the Tests
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        tox_ is used to run unit and integration tests in each of the supported Python
        environments.
        
        First install tox::
        
            $ pip install tox
        
        Then run tox from the project root directory::
        
            $ tox
        
        *Note: the integration tests require Sandboxie to be installed on your
        machine.*
        
        .. _tox: http://tox.testrun.org/
        
        
        Coding Style
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Ensure that your contributed code complies with `PEP 8`_. The test runner
        ``tox`` also checks for PEP 8 compliance.
        
        .. _PEP 8: http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/
