h3. Getting it

Installing via package management

{{{ Code bash
  # -Z to do unzipped install. The reason for installing it in un-zipped form
  #    is to make use of the command line tool.
  # -U to upgrade install
  easy_install -Z -U eazytext
}}}

''Source code''

Download the latest tar.gz from http://pypi.python.org/pypi/eazytext

Or to get the trunk version, check out from bazaar repository,
{{{ Code bash
  bzr branch lp:eazytext
}}}

h3. Command line usage

Make sure that eazytext package is installed in your environment (using
easy_install) or available via //PYTHONPATH//. 
''eazytext/eztext.py'' script under eazytext-package can be used as command
line tool. Either invoke it from its original path, or create a symbolic link
to a bin/ directory.

script-file:    <site-package>/eazytext/eztext.py

symbolic link to your binary path, like,

{{{ Code bash

    ln -s <site-package>/eazytext/eztext.py $(HOME)/bin/eztext.py
    # or,
    ln -s <site-package>/eazytext/eztext.py /usr/bin/eztext.py

}}}

Once `eztext.py` is available as an executable command and `eazytext` module 
in your python path, use the command-line tool, like,

{{{ Code bash

  eztext.py -o <out-file> <wiki-file>
  # For more help, try
  eztext.py -h

}}}
   
h3. Using it as library, in python

{{{ Code python
    from   eazytext  import Translate

    # To translate a wiki-file, 
    t = Translate( etxloc=wikifile, etxconfig=etxconfig )
    # To translate a wiki-text (incase it is not present in a file),
    t = Translate( etxtext=wikitext, etxconfig=etxconfig )
    # In both the cases the configuration paramters can passed via `etxconfig`
    # as a dictionary

    # Get the translated html,
    html = t( context=context )
    codecs.open( htmlfile, mode='w', encoding=encoding).write( html )
}}}
  
By browsing the source-doc you can learn more about development with EazyText.

h3. Start documenting

eazytext contents are normally stored in a //.etx// file. So open your favorite
editor and we will compose our first wiki document (if you are a vim user a 
[[ 'http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3500' | vim plugin ]] is
available for syntax highlighting)

> [<PRE In // 1862 //, ''Charles Lutwidge Dodgson'', a shy Oxford mathematician
 with a stammer, created a story about a little girl tubling down a rabbit
 hole. Thus geban the immortal adventures of Alice, perhaps the most popular
 heroine in English literature. Countless scholars have tried to define the
 charm of the Alice  books-with those wonderfully eccentric characters the
 '' Queen of Hearts, //Tweedledum// and //Tweedledee//, the //Cheshire Cat//,
 the //Mock Turtle// , the Mad Hatter, __et al__ '', by proclaiming that they
 really comprise a satire on
 language, a political allegory, a parody of Victorian children's
 literature, even a reflection of contemporary ecclesiastical history.
 Perhaps, as Dodgson might have said, Alice is no more than a dream, a
 fairy tale about the trials and tribulations of growing up-or down, or all
 turned around-as seen through the expert eyes of a child. >]

Translate the file using the command line option explained above, and we 
get a html file that renders as below,
