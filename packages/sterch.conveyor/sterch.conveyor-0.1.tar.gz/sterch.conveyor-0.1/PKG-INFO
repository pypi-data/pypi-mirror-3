        	* regular workers: 
        		- FirstWorker (utilizes only one queue to put initial tasks)
        		- Worker (utilizes two queues, usually one for input 2nd for output)
        		- LastWorker (utilizes only one queue to complete final tasks)
        	
        	* worker groups
        		- Group --- group of workers (usually it groups workers that performs similar tasks)
        		
        	* stages --- data processing stages
        		- FirstStage --- first tasks processing stage (tasks generation)
        		- Stage --- regular tasks execution
        		- LastStage --- last task execution
        		
        	* conveyor --- set of tasks processing stage
        		- Conveyor
        	
        	* ZCML directives to register workers
        	
        	* Test cases
