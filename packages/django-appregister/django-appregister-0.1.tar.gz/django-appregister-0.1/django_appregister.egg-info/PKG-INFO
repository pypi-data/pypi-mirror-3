Description: Django Appregister
        ========================================
        
        Django Appregister is a class registry system to allow you to easily implement
        a puggable
        
        See http://appregister.readthedocs.org/ for further documentation.
        
        
        Usage Example
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        In ``myapp/registry.py``::
        
            from appregister import Register
        
            class QuestionRegister(Register):
                base = 'myapp.models.Question'
                discovermodule = 'questions'
        
            questions = QuestionRegister()
        
        
        if ``myapp/models.py``::
        
            from django.db import models
            from myapp import registry
        
            class Question(models.Model):
                pass
        
            @registry.questions.register
            class MultipleChoiceQuestion(Question):
                pass
        
        
        You can then access all classes that have been registered by your app or by
        another app that extends it::
        
            from myapp import registry
        
            classes = registry.questions.all()
        
        If you add the following lines to your urls.py, you can autodiscover all
        question sublclasses that have been added to any of the apps in your
        INSTALLED_APPS::
        
            from myapp import registry
        
            registry.questions.autodiscover()
        
        This then allows developers to add their own subclasses to ``questions.py``
        within their apps and have them registered to the system for use, in a similar
        way to the addition and registration of ModelAdmins in ``admin.py`` files for
        Django's admin.
