Description: python SAML metadata aggregator
        ===============================
        
        This is a SAML metadata aggregator written in python. It is based on the model 
        for metadata exchange by Ian Young: http://iay.org.uk/blog/2008/10/metadata_interc.html
        
        In order to run this software you only need lxml. If you want to sign using 
        a PKCS#11 token you must install PyKCS11.

        *Release date: Wed Jul 11 16:31:06 CEST 2012*
        
        * XML signing and validation using http://pypi.python.org/pypi/dm.xmlsec.binding (requires M2Crypto at present)
        
        Because of the way OpenSSL handles self-signed certificates the XML validation extracts
        the public key from the certificate and uses that instead of the X509 certificate to 
        validate an XML signature. Right now this introduces a dependency on M2Crypto which will
        be removed in the fugure. Note that ubuntu/debian users should install python-m2crypto
        instead of installing M2Crypto (http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=637904)

        *Release date: Thu Aug 30 08:00:00 CEST 2012*
        
        * XML signing and validation using pyXMLSecurity
        * Support for PKCS#11-based HSMs using pykcs11
        
        We are now using a (limited) pure-python implmementation of xmlsec which makes it easier
        to sign using HSMs. The only mandatory non-python dependency now is lxml.
