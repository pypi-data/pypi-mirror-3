This directory contains the official WSGIServlet tutorial.  To run the
tutorial, chdir to this directory and execute the runtutorial script:

  cd <this directory>
  ./runtutorial [port]

Without an argument, runtutorial will start a web server on port 8000.
To start the server on another port, specify the desired port as an
argument.  The script will print out the URI you should visit in your
web browser.
