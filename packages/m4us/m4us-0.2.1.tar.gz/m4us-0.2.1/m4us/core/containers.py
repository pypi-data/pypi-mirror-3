"""Provides `components` that can contain and link other `components`.

Containers are `components` that contain other `components` and `coroutines`,
linking them in various ways.  These objects make it convenient to group
`coroutines` together to make larger reusable `components`.  The `coroutines`
contained within containers can be linked not only to each other, but to the
containers as well, allowing the containers externally to act like any other
`components`.

class Graphline(components.Component):

    """Container `component` of `coroutines` with fully configurable `links`.

    This corresponds to Kamaelia_'s :class:`!Graphline` class.

    This class is useful for grouping several `coroutines` together, while
    still being able to specify special (i.e. non-standard) `links` among them.
    Where the :class:`Pipeline` class provides a strait linear linkage between
    it's `coroutines`, this class allows you to specify your own `links` as
    required.

    Only the `links` need to be specified.  The unique collection of
    `coroutines` will be automatically extracted from them.

    Additionally, if a `source` or `sink` is specified as ``'self'``, then a
    `link` will be created with the :class:`Graphline` instance.  This allows
    `messages` sent to the :class:`Graphline` instance to be forwarded on to
    the appropriate child `coroutine` and `messages` from a child to be sent
    out as the output from the :class:`Graphline`.  Note, however, that unlike
    regular `links`, when using ``'self'``, `links` should be `outbox` to
    `outbox` or `inbox` to `inbox`.  Kamaelia_ calls these types of `links`
    *pass-through linkages*.

    Example:

    >>> graphline = Graphline(
    ...   ('self', 'inbox', coroutine1, 'inbox'),
    ...   ('self', 'control', coroutine1, 'control'),
    ...   (coroutine1, 'outbox', coroutine2, 'inbox'),
    ...   (coroutine1, 'signal', coroutine2, 'control'),
    ...   (coroutine1, 'outbox', coroutine3, 'inbox'),
    ...   (coroutine1, 'signal', coroutine3, 'control'),
    ...   (coroutine2, 'outbox', 'self', 'outbox'),
    ...   (coroutine2, 'signal', 'self', 'signal'),
    ...   (coroutine3, 'outbox', 'self', 'outbox'),
    ...   (coroutine3, 'signal', 'self', 'signal'),
    ... )
    >>> scheduler.register(*graphline.coroutines)
    >>> post_office.register(*graphline.links)

    In this example, `messages` sent to *graphline* will be forwarded on to
    *coroutine1*.  `Messages` from *coroutine1* will be sent to both
    *coroutine2* and *coroutine3*.  And `messages` from both *coroutine2* and
    *coroutine3* will be forwarded out from *graphline*. This is a good example
    of non-standard `links`.

    Assuming there is a `producer` and a `consumer` connected to either side of
    the graphline, then visually, the above example looks like this:

    .. digraph:: graphline

        rankdir=LR
        producer -> graphline [ label = "1" ]
        graphline -> consumer [ label = "5" ]
        graphline -> coroutine1 [ label = "2" ]
        coroutine1 -> coroutine2 [ label = "3" ]
        coroutine1 -> coroutine3 [ label = "3" ]
        coroutine2 -> graphline [ label = "4" ]
        coroutine3 -> graphline [ label = "4" ]

    :param kwargs: Any keyword arguments will be set as attributes on the
      instance.

    This corresponds to Kamaelia_'s :class:`!Pipeline` class.

    A pipeline consists of chaining each of the given `coroutines` together in
    order such that the ``outbox`` and ``signal`` `outboxes` of each
    `coroutine` are linked to the ``inbox`` and ``control`` `inboxes` of the
    next one.

    Similarily, the :class:`Pipeline`'s ``outbox`` and ``signal`` `outboxes`
    are linked to the last `coroutine`'s ``outbox`` and ``signal`` `outboxes`.
    This means that the pipeline can be treated like any other `coroutine`,
    responding to incomming `messages` and emitting outgoing `messages`.

    Example:

    >>> pipeline = Pipeline(coroutine1, coroutine2, coroutine3)
    >>> scheduler.register(*pipeline.coroutines)
    >>> post_office.register(*pipeline.links)
