- Alfa version
- Created recipe with ZopeSkel
-ÊAdded content type "Boardfile"
- Added browser views
-ÊAdded workflow "multiapprove workflow" so all "Reviewers" can "approve" or "reject" the boardfile
-ÊAdded time based trasaction... the "Boardfile" gets published after "n" days if none of the "Reviewers" has "rejected" it.
- Added "Boardfile-listing" view. 
  Warning: This will give you an error if you use it on a folder containing something else than "Boardfiles", so it is in "skins" dir and not in ues.

To do: 
=======
-ÊChange time to "creation date", it should take 20 days from creation, not from "last transaction in history".
-ÊFar to much code in "browser"... could need some help here.
-ÊTime before the transaction is now about 14 minutes (for testing), will change to 20 days.
