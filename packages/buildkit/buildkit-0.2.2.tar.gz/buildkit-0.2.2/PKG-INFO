        0.2.2
        -----
        
        2011-12-10
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        * Changed ``apt-cacher-ng`` to run on port 3142 to avoid a potential conflict
           with ``supervisor``
        
        2011-12-08
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        * Separated key generation from install of ``buildkit-apt-repo``.
        * Made repo and key base directory settings options of the ``buildkit repo`` 
          command so that its subcommands can just use repository names
        * Added a ``repo installkey`` command so that key generation can be customised
          and doesn't have to happen at install time
        * Made ``supervisor`` a dependency of ``buildkit-vm`` and added a sample
          config file
        
        2011-12-07
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        * Splitting the buildkit functionality up into different deb packages
        * Swapping apt-proxy for apt-cacher-ng
        
        2011-11-26
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        * Replaced facilify with stacks to reflect the rename
        * Release now updates any ``version`` variable in the ``__init__.py`` file
          of the base package
        * The ``--git`` option to the ``start`` command now doesn't give an error
        * Documenation fixes
        
        0.2.1
        -----
        
        2011-11-08
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        * Added a ``buildkit release`` command to update version numbers within a 
          buildkit-generated Python project directory structure
        * Updated the documentation to clarify some aspects of the install
        * Included the ``buildkit_deb`` directory in the source distribution and
          updated the ``MANIFEST.in`` file template so that when a project is
          generated it will include the Debian directory
        
        0.2.0
        -----
        
        2011-11-02
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        * Complete overhaul to support the creation of Debian packages from Python
          software, add them to a repository and test them in virtual machines on 
          Ubuntu LTS.
        
        0.1.2
        -----
        
        2011-02-19
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        * Bitbucket support
        * Ability to package as ``.deb`` files from a virtualenv
        
        0.1.1
        -----
        
        2010-09-05
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        * Changed template ``MANIFEST.in`` to include docs ``Makefile`` and ``conf.py``
        * Updated ``build.py`` example to build docs from distribution
        * Changed the ``build_html()`` and ``run()`` signatures
        
        2010-03-02
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        * Added a command to package up dependant modules into a single directory
        
        0.1.0
