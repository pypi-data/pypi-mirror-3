Description: Colorops converts between colorspaces, finds the best text color for your
        background, and can adjust hue, saturation, contrast and brightness. It's
        particularly useful for templated HTML and CSS, e.g:
        
        border: {{ primary_color.adjust(brightness_offset=0.4) }}
        
        The module uses YUV for high-quality results, rather than HSV.
