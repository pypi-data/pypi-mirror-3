Description: Flask-Admin
        ===========
        
        Introduction
        ------------
        
        This is library for building adminstrative interface on top of Flask framework.
        
        Instead of providing simple scaffolding for the SQLAlchemy models, Flask-Admin
        provides tools that can be used to build adminstrative interface of any complexity,
        using consistent look and feel.
        
        Small example (Flask initialization omitted)::
        
            app = Flask(__name__)
        
            admin = Admin()
            admin.add_view(ModelView(User, db.session))
            admin.add_view(GalleryManager(name='Photos', category='Cats'))
            admin.setup_app(app)
