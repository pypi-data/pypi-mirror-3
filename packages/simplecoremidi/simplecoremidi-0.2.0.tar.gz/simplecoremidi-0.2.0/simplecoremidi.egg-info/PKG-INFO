Description: Simple CoreMIDI for Python
        ====
        
        Simple CoreMIDI for Python is the simplest way of using MIDI in Python
        on Mac OS X. Period.
        
        
        Installation
        ----
        
            pip install simplecoremidi
        
        
        Usage
        ----
        
        To send midi out from your application::
        
            from simplecoremidi import send_midi
            send_midi((0x90, 0x3c, 0x40))
        
        This sends a MIDI Note On signal. To receive it you'll have to
        configure your DAW or software to receive from the "simple core midi
        source" MIDI source.
        
        To receive midi from another application::
        
            from simplecoremidi import recv_midi
            data = recv_midi()
        
        This returns all the midi data sent to the "simple core midi
        destination" MIDI destination since your last call. Put it inside a
        loop and poll it.
        
        Look at the example in the simplecoremidi/examples directory.
        
        
        Notes
        ----
        
        + It only works on Macs. It will never work on Windows or Linux.
        
        + It is not configurable.
