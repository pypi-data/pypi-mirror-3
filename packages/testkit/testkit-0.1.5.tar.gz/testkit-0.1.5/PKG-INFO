Description: testkit - A collection of tools for testing
        ===========================================
        
        This is a simple collection of test tools that have been developed out of need
        for some projects. However, some of these tools needed to be duplicated so I
        decided to consolidate them in this library.
        
        Features
        --------
        
        - Provides a way to use context managers in setup/teardown of a test
        - Provides a context manager for temporary directories
        - Provides a way to create shunts via fudge
        
        TODO
        ----
        
        - Add docs
        
        Developing
        ----------
        
        Install virtstrap via pip. Please install this system wide::
            
            $ pip install virtstrap
        
        Then cd to the project's root directory and do the following::
            
            $ vstrap init
        
        You can then activate the virtualenv::
            
            $ . quickactivate
