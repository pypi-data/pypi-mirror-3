        Yaybu Configuration Management
        ==============================
        
        Yaybu provides a simple configuration format for describing your infrastructure,
        and tools to turn that configuration into a running server.
        
        
        Hacking on yaybu
        ================
        
        To get a development environment with required dependencies::
        
        virtualenv venv
        source venv/bin/activate
        python bootstrap.py
        bin/buildout
        
        (The virtualenv is not strictly required).
        
        Running the tests
        -----------------
        
        NOTE: Currently the testrunner will try and run a set of integration tests
        against an ubuntu chroot. Because of that we are a bit ubuntu-specific.
        We'll be fixing that asap!
        
        You first need to build a fake environment in which to run the tests::
        
        ./bin/build-environment
        
        To run the tests::
        
        ./bin/test discover
