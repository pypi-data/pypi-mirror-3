Description: Poulda - a simple file upload web service
        =========================================
        
        Poulda is a simple file upload web service. It comes from a need I
        have to receive large files from friends and family who would not be
        bothered to use FTP or anything more complex than a web browser
        interface. Amongst its features are such diverse elements as:
        
        - only authenticated users may upload a file;
        
        - user accounts (login and password) are configured in the WSGI
          configuration file;
        
        - a progress bar appears during the upload (unless you disabled
          JavaScript);
        
        - relatively old browsers should be supported relatively well;
        
        - the user interface is in English or French, hopefully not both at
          the same time.
        
        
        Requirements
        ============
        
        Poulda requires Python 2.7 and an RDBMS. SQLite will do very well
        unless you expect a large number of simultaneous users (in which case
        you may want to think twice anyway, since Poulda has not been
        developed and tested to scale up).
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        1. It is highly recommended that you install Poulda in a `virtual
           environment`_. Once you have one, you may install Poulda and its
           dependencies::
        
               $ easy_install Poulda
        
        3. Download the development `WSGI configuration file`_ and make
           appropriate changes (see the `Configuration`_ section below). [#]_
        
        4. Install Waitress (or use your preferred WSGI server and tweak the
           WSGI configuration file)::
        
               $ easy_install waitress
        
        5. And finally start the application::
        
               $ pserve production.ini
        
        .. _virtual environment: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv
        
        .. _WSGI configuration file: https://raw.github.com/dbaty/poulda/master/development.ini
        
        .. [#] The source repository also provides a more production-ready
               configuration file: `<https://raw.github.com/dbaty/poulda/master/production.ini>`_.
        
        
        Configuration
        =============
        
        The WSGI configuration file should be modified to fit your system and
        your needs:
        
        ``poulda.accounts``
          A space (or new line) separated list of user accounts. Each user
          account is composed by the login, followed by a colon, followed by
          the password. Passwords must not contain the space character.
        
          Examples::
        
            poulda.accounts = jsmith:secret jane.doe:mYp3ssWord
            poulda.accounts = jsmith:secret
                              jane.doe:mYp3ssWord
        
        ``poulda.db_url``
          The database connection string.
        
          Examples::
        
            poulda.db_url = sqlite:///%(here)s/Poulda.db
            poulda.db_url = postgresql://poulda:secret_password@localhost/poulda
        
        ``poulda.enabled``
          The string "true" if you wish to enable the service. If any other
          value is provided, all pages will show a message that indicates that
          the service is disabled (and users will not be able to do anything).
        
        ``poulda.secret``
          A secret string that will be used to encrypt authentication tokens.
        
        ``poulda.upload_dir``
          The path to the directory where uploaded files will be stored.
