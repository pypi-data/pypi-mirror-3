ikaaro 0.60.2 (2009/06/03)
==========================

This is a Content Management System built on Python & itools, among
other features ikaaro provides:

 - content and document management (index&search, metadata, etc.)
 - multilingual user interfaces and content
 - high level modules: wiki, forum, tracker, etc.

There have been various optimizations, most notably of the folder's
browse content view, which now retrieves the last modification time
and last author from the catalog instead of asking Git.

The 'icms-update-catalog.py' script has been optimized too, specially
by parallelizing the calls to Git.  Also, this script accepts a new
'--quiet' option.

The 'icms-start.py' script does not accept anymore the '--address' and
'--port' options.

Many bugs have been fixed, including #585, #592, #663, #664, #667, #668,
#673, #674, #683 and #692.
