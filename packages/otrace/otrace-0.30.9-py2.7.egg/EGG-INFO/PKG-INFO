Description: otrace: An object-oriented debugger for nonlinear tracing
        ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        
        *otrace* is an object-oriented debugger for nonlinear tracing
        of asynchronous or multithreaded interactive programs. It addresses
        some of the limitations of sequential debugging techniques which
        do not work well with server programs, where multiple requests are
        handled in parallel. For example, instrumenting web servers with
        print/logging statements can often result in voluminous log output
        with interleaved streams of messages.
        
        *otrace* takes a different approach to debugging that relies less on
        sequential operations. Its features including taking "snapshots"
        of variables for tracing, "tagging" objects for tracking across
        different method invocations, and modifying live code
        ("monkey patching") to insert print statements etc.
        
        *otrace* maps all the objects in the running program, as well as the
        "snapshot" objects, to a virtual filesystem mounted under ``/osh``.
        It provides a shell-like interface, *oshell*, with commands like
        *cd*, *ls* etc. that can be used to browse classes, methods, and
        instance variables in the virtual filesystem. Tab completion and
        simple wildcarding are supported.
