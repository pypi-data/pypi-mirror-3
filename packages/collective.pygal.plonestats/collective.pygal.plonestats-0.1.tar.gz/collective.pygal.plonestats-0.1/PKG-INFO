Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        collective.pygal.plonestats is mainly meant to demonstrate the ease of
        use and integration of pygal into plone. It shows how to create charts
        and render them into a pagetemplate. It uses the portal catalog indexes
        for the analyses.
        
        It will give you an overview of the contents in your plonesite:
        
        - Keywords: which keywords are used in your site as a piechart
        
        - Content by Creator: Who create how many content items in a barchart
        
        - Content by types: which content types are used how frequently in a
        horizontal barchart.
        
        - Review states: A piechart displaying how many items are in which
        review states
        
        - Created items by year: A linechart showing the additions to your
        site by year
        
        - Created items by month: A filled linechart to visualize the growth
        of the content in a plone site.
