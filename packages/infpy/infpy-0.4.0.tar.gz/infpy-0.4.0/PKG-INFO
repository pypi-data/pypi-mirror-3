Description: *Infpy* is a python package I have put together that implements some of 
        the algorithms I (John Reid) have used in my research. In particular it 
        has a Gaussian process package that is largely based on this excellent 
        book__.

        The infpy Gaussian process package features:
        
        * Many different kernels are supported out of the box
        * Kernel composition (point-wise sum and product)
        * Maximum likelihood estimation of hyper-parameters
        * Numpy integration
        * Matplotlib plots
        * Best of both worlds : ease of using an interpreted language but all 
          performance critical linear algebra performed in compiled code
