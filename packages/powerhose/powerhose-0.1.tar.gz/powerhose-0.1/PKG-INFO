        =========
        
        Powerhose turns your CPU-bound tasks into I/O-bound tasks so your Python applications
        are easier to scale.
        
        Powerhose is an implementation of the
        `Request-Reply Broker <http://zguide.zeromq.org/page:all#A-Request-Reply-Broker>`_
        pattern in ZMQ.
