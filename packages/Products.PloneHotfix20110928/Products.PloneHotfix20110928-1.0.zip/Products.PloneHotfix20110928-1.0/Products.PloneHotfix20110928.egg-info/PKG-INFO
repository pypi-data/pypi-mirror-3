Description: Plone Hotfix package, 2011-10-04
        ********************************
        
        This hotfix fixes the following vulnerabilities:
        
        * A vulnerability in CMFEditions where KwAsAttributes classes were publishable,
          exposing sub-objects to anonymous access. This vulnerability is found in
          CMFEditions 2.0a1 and up. CMFEditions 1.x and before are not vulnerable.
        
        * Zope vulnerability `CVE 2011-3587`_. This vulnerability is found in Zope
          2.12.x and 2.13.x. Zope 2.11 and before are not vulnerable.
        
          This Plone Hotfix applies the same fix as Products.Zope_Hotfix_CVE_2011_3587
          and can co-exist with that patch.
        
        .. _`CVE 2011-3587`: http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2011-3587
        
        
        This hotfix is supported on Plone 4.0 - 4.0.9, 4.1 and 4.2. Older versions
        of Plone (3.3.x and below) are not affected by the vulnerabilities and are not
        supported by this patch.
        
        The fixes included here will be incorporated into subsequent releases of Plone,
        so Plone 4.0.10, 4.1.1, 4.2a3 and greater should not require this hotfix.
