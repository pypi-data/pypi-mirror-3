* Only works with taskwarrior 1.9.4 and 2.0.0.

  Taskhelm requires task's export.json and import.json commands for
  interoperating with task.  These commands first became available in
  version 1.9.4, so no earlier versions can be supported.

  TaskWarrior 2.0.0 support is still rather preliminary and tested only
  against beta4.

* Doesn't work with Python 2.5 or earlier.

  Several datetime and pygtk features are used in taskhelm, which only
  became available in Python 2.6.

* Doesn't work on <platform>

  Taskhelm has been tested on Ubuntu 11.04, 11.10, and (the upcoming)
  12.04.  It should work on other Linux distros that have python 2.6 or
  newer but no testing has been done.

* Editor doesn't update task title properly.

  The editor does actually update the task, it just doesn't refresh it
  properly.  Click the refresh button or reopen the task to work around
  this bug.

* Editor windows behave poorly:  Lack icons for the windows yet
  display in the taskbar; multiple instances of editor can be opened for
  one task.  

* Task counts in context menu seem off.

  When you reschedule a task +4 days, you would expect the count in the
  '4d' context menu item to increment.  But a moment after waiting, the
  task is waiting only 3.99 days, so is counted in the '3d' menu item,
  not '4d'.  Not clear what the proper fix to this should be...

* Tasks aren't sorted H > M > L when sorting on priority.

  They sort alphabetically instead (H > L > M).

* Tasks with numbers like '1.0' get changed to '1.000000'
