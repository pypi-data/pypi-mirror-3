"""
XHPy is XHP for Python - it augments Python syntax such that XML document
fragments become valid Python expressions.

Using XHPy in your applications is simple. First, install it with

$ easy_install xhpy

and then just add

import xhpy.init

at the top of your main application file. All subsequent imports will
pass through the XHPy preprocessor.
