For Developers
==============

The complete sources are available via SVN from
https://svn.gnufix.de/repos/main/ulif.loghandlers.

You can get a copy of the trunk with::

$ svn co https://svn.gnufix.de/repos/main/ulif.loghandlers/trunk

As this package is based on zc.buildout_, you might want to build the
development environment first.

Change to the checked out directory and do::

  $ python bootstrap.py

This will create local files needed for running `buildout`. This step
is normally needed only once.::

  $ ./bin/buildout

will then do the heavy stuff: fetch needed packages, install the
testrunner and documentation generation scripts, etc.

You normally only have to rerun `buildout` only after changes to
`setup.py` or `buildout.cfg`.

:mod:`ulif.loghandlers` tests are based on py.test_. The needed test
script should be generated by `buildout` automatically. You can run
the tests entering::

  $ ./bin/py.test

Releases of :mod:`ulif.loghandlers` should provide a test coverage of
100%. If you intend to send a patch, please also provide tests for
your changes and check the test coverage with::

  $ ./bin/py.test --cov src/ulif/loghandlers

The documentation can be built doing::

  $ ./bin/sphinx-build docs/source docs/build/html

and can be found as HTML in `docs/build/html/` afterwards.
