Description: This package is a tiny wrapper around the ``wssplat`` bundle of ``pyxb``
        for XML digital signatures and XML encryption.
        It also provides some utilities for initialization and cleanup of
        ``libxml2` and ``pyxmlsec`` used by ``dm.saml2`` to implement digital signatures.
        
        The package has been tested with ``pyxb`` version 1.1.3.
        It may not work with other ``pyxb`` versions.
        
        The package primarily exists to support ``dm.saml2``.
        Its importance for other projects is likely small;
        direct use of the ``wssplat`` bundle of ``pyxb`` is likely preferable.
        
        ``pyxb`` does not yet support ``easy_install``. Therefore, this
        package does not declare its dependence on ``pyxb``.
