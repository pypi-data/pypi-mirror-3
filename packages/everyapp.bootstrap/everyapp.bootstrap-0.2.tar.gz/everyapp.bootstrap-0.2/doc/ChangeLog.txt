	Upgraded dependencies to newest versions.

	* Upgraded dependencies to distribute 0.6.24, virtualenv 1.7.1.2 and
	added pip 1.1 as a dependency since virtualenv needs it and the
	bootstrap code uses it as well.
	[2b588198b9fb]

2010-12-21  Krys Lawrence  <krys@krys.ca>

	* README.txt, doc/source/index.rst:
	Worked around a PyPI bug.

	* PyPI does not render links in substitutions, so README.txt was
	changed so that the links are in the text and the substitutions
	just hide the file references.
	* Also had to fix up index.rst by making the links link directly to
	the html pages instead of using :ref:. This has the consequence
	that the links do not show up in the PDF version of the docs.
	[b91df2c9401d]

2010-12-07  Krys Lawrence  <krys@krys.ca>

	* bootstrap.py, doc/NEWS.txt, everyapp/bootstrap/customize.py:
	Fixed a bug in parsing the [options] secion of bootstrap.cfg.

	 * If an option in [options] had more than one equals sign (=),
	bootstrap.py would blow up. This prevented the common use of

	directives are not supported in rst2html.py.

	included when using Sphinx's man builder and not the other
	builders.
	 * This also meant changing conf.py so that the doctree cache directory
	for the man builder is different than the other builders. It is
	now put in a sub-directory of the regular doctrees cache
	directory.

	the sidebar TOC look nicer. It is also more consistent with the
	latex version.
	 * Added ".. contents::" directived to documents that have sub-sections
	(i.e. greater than 2 levels deep from the main TOC) so that they
	are still easily accessable even though they are not listed in
	the main TOC anymore.

	Massive restructuring of the docs again. Also completed usage.

	 * Created a doc/source directory to contain all the Sphinx source
	files.
	 * Moved all SPOhinx-specifiec files to the new source directory.
	 * Created new sphinx source files for each of the remaining plain text
	files in doc.
	 * The SPhinx files include the plain text files.
	 * All this seperates the Sphinx documentation generation from the
	plain text documentation, asside from some formatting in the
	plain text files. This seperation provide much greater
	flexibility in organizing and naming the documentation files.
	 * Renamed all the non-core plain text file names to lower case. This
	makes the core ones stand out better, as per orginal intention.
	 * Moved the man source files into the Sphinx source directory. This
	integrates them better and they no longer have to be special-cased.
	 * Added reference targets to all chapter and section headings for easy
	referencing in other pages.
	 * Changed all :doc: references to :ref: references.
	 * Finished the Basic Usage section.
	 * Restructured and added to the BUGS.txt file. It now includes hte
	lack of Python 3.x support.
	 * Added an empty glossary that can be used in the future to define
	terms used in the documentation.
	 * All section references noe use underscores instead of hyphens as the
	namming convention.
	 * Many small tweaks to section titles and other parts of the docs.
	 * Updated the doc.README.txt file to reflect the new scruture and
	naming conventions.
	 * Removed the .. highlight: directives as they are not currently
	adding anything useful to the rendered docs.
	 * Added an Appendix B that lists the default bootstrap.cfg file.
	 * The directory structure inside doc/source now more closely matches
	the documentaion structure.
	 * Also updated the To Do list.

	Finished applying licence headers to all source files.

	 * Decided that the documentation should be under the same licence
	as the source code, even when in generated formats.
	 * Since all files are now source, they now all have copyright and
	licence headers. (Except files like .hgignore, setup.cfg, etc.)
	This is recommended by both the GPL guidelines and the Apache
	Foundation in it's policies, so it's good tradition, even if no
	one seems to do it in real life. :)
	 * Changed layout.html so that all generated HTML and EPUB files
	include the copyright and licence header.
	 * Becasue a header was added to the default bootstrap.cfg file and the
	generated versions of that file should not have the header, a
	special marker was added and mkbootstrap.py was updated to strip
	the marker and everything before it.
	 * Updated and added the licensing information to the man files so that
	they they indicate that the generated man files themselves are
	licensed under the same terms as the rest of the project.
	 * Added a new section to LICENCE.txt outlineing the documentation
	licensing.

	 * Added some basic usage information to USAGE.txt so that it is more

	match the documentation text.

	* doc/GLOSSARY.txt, doc/TODO.txt, doc/conf.py, doc/contents.txt,

	plain text.
	 * The default role is now "term" to make it easy to refer to glossary
	entries.
	 * Docstrings that were previously relying on the default role being
	"obj" have been updated accordingly.
	 * To Do List updated accordingly as well.

	and expanded it. This file is also the source for the
	mkbootstrap.1 man page.
	 * Moved the bootstrap.py usage documentation to doc/BOOTSTRAP.PY.txt
	and expanded it. This file is also the source for the
	bootstrap.py.1 man page.
	 * Updated a lot of references to the moved usage documenation.
	 * Moved known bugs that are specific to a particualr command into the
	command's usage documentation so that is shows up in the man page.
	 * Updated doc/BUGS.txt to indicate that it lists general known bugs
	and make reference to the usage documents for specific known bugs
	 * Updated doc/conf.py to correctly generate the man pages and fixed a
	formatting bug.
	 * Updated doc.USAGE.txt to include a toctree refering to the new
	seperate usage documents. It still contains the bootstrap.cfg
	info that needs to be moved out to it's own file. Also, it needs
	some general usage instructions to be added.
	 * Tweaked the --help epilogue for mkbootstrap to make it more
	consistent with the rest of the docs.
	 * Tweaked the --help information in customize.py to be more accurate.
	 * Finally, updated bootstrap.py to reflect the other changes.

	 * Many small tweaks like adding additional substitutions where
	appropriate for improved text-only readablitly.
	 * Removed some of the fields at the top of index.txt since their
	information is provided by README.txt already and included in
	index.txt by extension.
	 * Removed the hiding of bare URLs in the form of "everyapp.bootstrap
	at someplace", in favour of just exposing the bare URLs. This
	makes things easier and more consisten between plain-text/man
	page versions and the other rendered version like html and latex.

	differently for HTML and PDF/EPUB formats.
	 * Reverted Makefile and make.bat back to their original, unmodified
	versions from changeset 7a2dcbcce9ff. In particular, this means
	there is no longer a "manual" tag and a common doctrees directory
	is used again for all formats.
	 * Refined some wording in README.txt.
	 * Adjusted README.txt to work better with index.txt.
	 * Changed INSTALL.txt so that it is only for installation and
	upgradeing information and not a generage Getting Started
	document.
	 * index.txt now also include a Documentation field.
	 * "Indices and Tables" has been moved to contents.txt.
	 * index.txt no longer lists the table of contents directly. Instead
	it links to contents.txt.
	 * HACKING.txt has been changed to have a better first section title
	and improved wording.
	 * The document title in conf.py has also been changed due to the
	restructuring.

	only the table of contents and the quick search field. Also, the
	table of contents is now global to the whole project instead of

	 * Changed the docs to confirm to this new structuring.
	 * Heavily altered the root README.txt. It now reads much better both
	as text and when rendered.
	 * README.txt links now point to the HTML docs that will be on
	python.org.
	 * Table of contents moved to contents.txt.
	 * introduction.txt used for PDF and ePUB formats.
	 * Added code to customize configuration based on a presence of a
	"manual" tag. This tag flags that Sphinx should render the docs
	in the form of a manual (with an introduction), rather than as
	HTML docs (with and index page).
	 * Added README.html to .hgignore so that test rendering of the root
	README.txt will not get committed.
	 * Added a USAGE.txt file to document how to use the project.
	 * Added a README.txt to doc/ that will describe the doc/ directory and
	how to render the docs.

	appropriate.
	 * TODO.txt now also lists ..todo:: message automatically when
	rendered.

	to doc/README.txt.
	 * Moved the Sphinx docs and infrastructure from doc/manual and

	* MANIFEST.in, README.txt, doc/AUTHORS.txt, doc/BUGS.txt,
	doc/COPYING.txt, doc/FAQ.txt, doc/HACKING.txt, doc/INSTALL.txt,
	doc/LICENCE.txt, doc/NEWS.txt, doc/THANKS.txt, doc/TODO.txt,

	src/everyapp/bootstrap/__init__.py,
	src/everyapp/bootstrap/bootstrap.cfg,
	src/everyapp/bootstrap/customize.py,
	src/everyapp/bootstrap/mkbootstrap.py:
	Fixed line ending compatibility and cleaned up README.txt.

	 * Since Windows-friendlyness is a priority for this project, all
	file line endings have been changed to \r\n. All new files
	should also be like that.
	 * All files are also utf-8 encoded without a BOM.
	 * Finally, since .txt extension is important for Windows-friendlyness
	and since bitbucket.org only renders .txt files as plain text,
	regardless of preamble, I have removed the formerly commented-out
	text from README.txt. The removed text can be added again later
	by copying it out of the previous revision.
	[683facc4674e]

	* README.txt, doc/TODO.txt, setup.py:
	Fixed up README.txt and updated TODO.txt.

	 * README.txt should now show up rendered on bitbucket.org.
	 * The link to source files in README.txt now point to tip and the
	$VERSION$ subsitution for sdist has been removed. This makes the
	links work even from bitbucket.org, though now releases will
	still point to tip instead of the correct release.
	 * When and if a mailing list is set up, it will be at librelist.com
	instead of Google Groups.
	 * Removed a few completed items from TODO.txt.
