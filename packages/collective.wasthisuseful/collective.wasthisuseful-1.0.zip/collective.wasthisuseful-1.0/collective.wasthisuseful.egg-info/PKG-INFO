Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This product adds a viewlet which allows users to rate the usefulness of a
        content item.
        
        It also registers an Event which can be used in Plone's Content Rules so that
        an e-mail can be sent immediately after a rating has been submitted.
        
        Features
        ========
        
        - Viewlet (below content) presents a form with the question 
          "Was this information useful?":
        
          * Clicking "Yes" immediately submits
          * Clicking "No" shows a comment field and submit button
        - By default, enabled for "Document" types, others selectable.
        - Can be overridden (enabled and disabled) for all content types.
        - Enables immediate e-mail notification, with the rating value ("Yes" or "No")
          and rating comment (in the case of "No") as e-mail variables.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        To your `buildout.cfg`, add::
            
            eggs =
                ...
                collective.wasthisuseful
        
        After that, just install via the "Add-on" controlpanel.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Enable e-mail notification
        --------------------------
        
        Create a content rule which has "Usefulness rated" as a trigger. As the rule's
        action, select "Send e-mail". In the e-mail message, you can use
        `${usefulness_comment}` and `${usefulness_value}` as variables (in addition to
        the usual `${url}` and `${title}`.
        
        Select enabled types
        --------------------
        
        The "WasThisUseful-settings" form enables you to select on which content types
        the viewlet is available. You can reach is via the Plone control panel ("Site 
        setup") or directly via `@@wasthisuseful-settings`.
        
        Enabling and disabling specific folders
        ---------------------------------------
        
        You can override the "enabled types" behaviour by going to
        the "Usefulness ratings" tab. On folderish objects, you can disable rating for
        the folderish object and its children. 
        
            You can even do this for content items that are not in the "enabled types"
            list.
        
        Whether an object has ratings enabled is decided in the following order:
            1. Has the object itself been set to enabled / disabled (using the
               "Usefulness ratings" tab)? If so, use that setting.
            2. Has the object's direct parent been set to enabled / disabled (using the
               "Usefulness ratings" tab)? If so, use that setting.
            3. Is the object of a type that has been enabled on the
               "WasThisUseful-settings" controlpanel?
        
        To do
        =====
        
        - Event IUsefulnessEvent seems only to be fired for non-folderish items
        - Show warning when viewing settings of item that is default view (like Topic
          `aggregator` in News Folder).
        - Show number of ratings
        - Integrate with collective.contentratings_
        - Translate rating value ("Yes"/"No") in content rule e-mail
