        Introduction
        ============
        
        This library packages `amCharts`_ for `fanstatic`_. It provides both the
        `Chart`_ and `Stock`_ Javascript chart libraries.
        
        .. _fanstatic: http://fanstatic.org
        .. _amCharts: http://www.amcharts.com
        .. _Stock: http://www.amcharts.com/stock/
        .. _Chart: http://www.amcharts.com/javascript/
        
        This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``, and
        making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources`` directory
        in ``js.amcharts``) are published to some URL.
        
        How to use?
        ===========
        
        You can import ``amcharts`` or ``amstock`` from ``js.amcharts`` and ``need`` it
        where you want these resources to be included on a page:
        
        * ``amcharts`` will provide only the `Chart`_ library...
        * while ``amstock`` will provide both the `Chart`_ and `Stock`_ libraries.
        
          >>> from js.amcharts import amstock, amcharts
          >>> amcharts.need()
          >>> amstock.need()
        
        amCharts needs a few images sometimes, and you need to pass the path to the
        images in the Javascript code as follow::
        
            chart = new AmCharts.AmSerialChart();
            chart.pathToImages = "/lib/samples/javascript/images/";
        
        Since this path depends on your server configuration and Fanstatic
        configuration, you can use the convient ``find_images_url`` from this library:
        
          >>> from js.amcharts import find_images_url
          >>> find_images_url() # doctest: +SKIP
          "/some/path/images/"
