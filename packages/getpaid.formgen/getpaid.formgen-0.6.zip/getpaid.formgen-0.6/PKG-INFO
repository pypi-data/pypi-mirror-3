Description: getpaid.formgen Package
        =======================
        
        Overview
        --------
        
        PloneGetPaid-PloneFormGen
        
        Link PloneFormGen with PloneGetPaid so a form can add items or donations
        to the GetPaid shopping cart.
        
        
        
        Requirements:
        -------------
        To begin with we need a working Plone instance with PloneGetPaid, PloneFormGen
        and DataGridField installed.
        
        Install:
        --------
        There are two ways of installing getpaid.formgen, if you got it as an egg you
        just easy_install it or fetch it with your buildout or else you can copy the
        inner formgen from this folder structure to your instance's
        /lib/python/getpaid.
        After that you will see PloneGetPaid-PloneFormGen in your plone control
        pannel addon product section (you may see two, install whichever you want, 
        they are the same thing).
        After hitting install you are done, now whenever you create a FormGen folder
        you will have as available content types a "GetPaid Adapter" which creates the
        required folders for a GetPaid checkout and allows you to map any GetPaid
        product on the site to a field on your form.
        
        A few remarks:
        --------------
          * If you are using other adapters (such as salesforce one) please make sure to
            edit and save (even without changes) this one last, because it adds a clause
            to all other present adapters so they execute after it, this avoids comitting
            data of an order that can be rejected.
          * Make sure to remove the default mail adapter from the FormgenForm or you
            could end up sending sensible data by mail by accident.

        ----------------
        
        - Add a mechanism for recording form fields in a dictionary on the shopping
          cart. If a form field has getpaid_formgen_fieldset and getpaid_formgen_field
          attributes, it will get recorded in cart.getpaid_formgen_data[fieldset][field]
          [davisagli]
        
        - Use the field path as the key for the data grid field, rather than the

          These files were brought in from a Mercurial tarball (provided by David

        :: 
         
          [tailor]
          verbose = True
          source = hg:
          target = svn:
          start-revision = 14
          root-directory = ~/Desktop/getpaid.formgen
          encoding = UTF-8
          [hg:tailor]
          repository = ~/Desktop/getpaid.formgen
          [svn:tailor]
          repository = https://getpaid.googlecode.com/svn
          module = getpaid.formgen/trunk/src
        
        - Also, I removed all .pyc files before migration with:
        
        ::
        
          find . -type f -name "*.pyc" -exec rm -f {} \;
        
        - ripped out perrito's unnecessary action adapter blocking PFG already
          handles that if you return an error value

        - Added remarks about usage
        - pumped some info into the readme file
        - Added support to run other adapters before doing one page checkout 
          redirection to thank you page.
