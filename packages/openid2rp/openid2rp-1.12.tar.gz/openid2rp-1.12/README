openid2rp
=========

This library helps writing OpenID applications (a.k.a relying
parties). See the documentation_ for further usage information.
Bug reports should be sent to the bugtracker_. The source code
is maintained on bitbucket_.

The main library is entire web-framework agnostic, and requires
the application to store any persistent data needed for the relying
party. 

The package also includes a Django authentication module,
which stores all necessary data; providing a user interface for
logging in is still left to the application.

Furthermore, a WSGI middleware is also included which simplifies
integrating OpenID into WSGI-based web frameworks. Again, all UI
aspects are left to the application.
