Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        Add-on for Plone to list all Python packages available to the running Python process, its versions
        and other information about them.
        
        This add-on depends heavily on yolk_.
        
        Once installed the add-on makes available two views:
        
        - ``@@list-python-packages``: list all Python packages available to the running Python process, its
        versions and other information about them.
        
        - ``@@list-sys-path``: show the value of ``sys.path``.
        
        It also installs a configlet in the Plone control-panel that allows access to these two views.
        
        Only manager users can access the views and the configlet.
