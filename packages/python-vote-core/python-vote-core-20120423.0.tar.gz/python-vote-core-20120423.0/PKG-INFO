        Basic Usage
        -----------
        
        Schulze method example::
        
          print SchulzeMethod([
            { "count":3, "ballot":[["A"], ["C"], ["D"], ["B"]] },
            { "count":9, "ballot":[["B"], ["A"], ["C"], ["D"]] },
            { "count":8, "ballot":[["C"], ["D"], ["A"], ["B"]] },
            { "count":5, "ballot":[["D"], ["A"], ["B"], ["C"]] },
            { "count":5, "ballot":[["D"], ["B"], ["C"], ["A"]] }
          ], ballot_notation = "grouping").as_dict()
