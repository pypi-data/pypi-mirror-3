You are likely interested in this program because you have far more tasks to do than you can do in a single day.  Setting 'waits' on tasks allows you to postpone some of your tasks off to future days.

Select several tasks in the Task List Browser by clicking one task, holding down shift, and clicking another one.  Now right click on the selection, navigate to the 'Wait...' submenu, and select one of the options.

The set of wait options to be displayed can be configured in your ~/.taskhelmrc.
