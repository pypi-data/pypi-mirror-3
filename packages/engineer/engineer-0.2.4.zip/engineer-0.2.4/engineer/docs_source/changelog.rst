version 0.2.4 - May 27, 2012
============================

- A new theme, :ref:`oleb`, has been added. This theme is based on Ole Begemann's oleb.net design and was created with
  his permission.
- During rendering, a new variable called ``all_posts`` is passed. It is a :class:`~engineer.models.PostCollection`
  containing all the posts on the site and can be used to display links to related posts, similarly tagged posts, etc.
- Themes can now be wrapped in a Python package, installed, and register themselves as a
  :ref:`theme plugin <theme plugins>`.
- Bug fixes related to sites hosted at non-root paths.


version 0.2.3 - May 6, 2012
===========================

- External themes are now supported. You can place your custom theme either inside a :file:`themes` directory in your

  :attr:`~engineer.conf.EngineerConfiguration.THEME_DIRS` setting.
