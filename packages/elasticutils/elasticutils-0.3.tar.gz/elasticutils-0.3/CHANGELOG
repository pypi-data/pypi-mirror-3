Version 0.3: Released June 1st, 2012
====================================

* Add documentation for debugging, project details and other things.

* Minor project cleanup to make it easier to maintain and use

* Make ``get_es()`` more useful. It now takes overrides that allow you to
  configure multiple kinds of ES objects for different purposes.
