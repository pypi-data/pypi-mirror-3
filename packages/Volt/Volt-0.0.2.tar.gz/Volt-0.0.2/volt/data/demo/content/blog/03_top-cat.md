Top Cat! The most effectual Top Cat! Who's intellectual close friends get
to call him T.C., providing it's with dignity. Top Cat! The indisputable
leader of the gang. He's the boss, he's a pip, he's the championship. He's
the most tip top, Top Cat.

I never spend much time in school but I taught ladies plenty. It's true I hire
my body out for pay, hey hey. I've gotten burned over Cheryl Tiegs, blown up
for Raquel Welch. But when I end up in the hay it's only hay, hey hey. I might
jump an open drawbridge, or Tarzan from a vine. 'Cause I'm the unknown stuntman
that makes Eastwood look so fine.

Thunder, thunder, thundercats, Ho! Thundercats are on the move, Thundercats are
loose. Feel the magic, hear the roar, Thundercats are loose. Thunder, thunder,
thunder, Thundercats! Thunder, thunder, thunder, Thundercats! Thunder, thunder,
thunder, Thundercats! Thunder, thunder, thunder, Thundercats! Thundercats!
