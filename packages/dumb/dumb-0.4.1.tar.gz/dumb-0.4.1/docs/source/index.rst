Welcome to dumb's documentation!
================================

dumb is a suite of tools to manage collections of bookmarks that are:

* indipendent from the browser / application:
   dumb bookmarks can point to anything that has an URL, regardless
   of the app needed to open them.
* shareable and distributed:
   dumb bookmarks are designed to be easily managed in a DVCS to provide
   an easy mean to share a bookmark collection within a team, a community
   or the whole world.

This is the documentation for the dumb python module and the command 
line interface.
