This is a JSONRPC Service for git repositories, and a Pyjamas Web/Desktop
front-end.  The front-end aims to be a full functional git repository
browser.  Once this has been achieved, file editing (as a pyjamas
plugin) and file commit will be considered.  This would allow developers
to work on projects entirely remotely, with only access to a web browser.

Current Status: utterly boring but happily functional

Dependencies:

* Pyjamas or Pyjamas-Desktop (apt-get install pyjamas [pyjamas-desktop])
* python-git (apt-get install python-git)
* python-simplejson (apt-get install python-simplejson)
* python-cjson (apt-get install python-cjson)

Starting up:

To start the JSONRPC web service:

    $ cd jsonservice
    $ python srv.py {path to top level of repository} &

To build the javascript front-end and run it:

    $ cd ../pyjamas
    $ ./build.sh # requires symlink ~/bin/pyjsbuild to sandbox
    $ firefox http://127.0.0.1:8000/output/JSONRPCService.html &

To start the desktop version (doesn't require building the javascript)

    $ python JSONRPCService.py 

Apache Proxy:

The deployment of some weird python service as the sole web browser is somewhat
unacceptable.  Try these in an apache config to make life somewhat more
tolerable.  It is probably wise to move the built output to somewhere that
the Apache Server can get at, direct, rather than let the python JSONRPC
service (based on SimpleHTTPServer) serve up static HTML.
