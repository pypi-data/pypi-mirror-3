Description: Unit Tests
        ----------
        
        To run only the unit tests, and exclude the integration tests:
        
            diana@ubuntu:~/workspace/inferno$ nosetests --exclude=integration
        
        To run both the unit and integration tests:
        
            diana@ubuntu:~/workspace/inferno$ nosetests
        
        If the tests were successful, you should see something like the following.
        
            ----------------------------------------------------------------------
            Ran 100 tests in 1.000s
        
            OK
        
        The integration test suite assumes you have a running disco cluster.
        
            diana@ubuntu:~$ disco start
            Master ubuntu:8989 started
         
        And that your inferno settings (~/.inferno or /etc/inferno/settings.yaml) 
        point to that disco master.
        
            diana@ubuntu:~$ cat ~/.inferno
            server: disco://localhost
