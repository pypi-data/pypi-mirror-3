================
Clustered setups
================

Baruwa is capable of running in a cluster, The only requirement is that the 
nodes share session information and have access to either the same MQ broker
or use a MQ broker that is clustered with the other brokers serving the other
nodes. 

If you are running your nodes from the same database backend or running multi
master replication and using a single MQ broker then this will work out of 
the box.

You will be able to run the same message management operations on any of the
nodes within a cluster.

.. note::

	As of version 1.1.0 the status view will only show the status of the host
	you are connected to, In future versions you will be able to view the
	global cluster status as well as select a remote node in order to view its
	status.
