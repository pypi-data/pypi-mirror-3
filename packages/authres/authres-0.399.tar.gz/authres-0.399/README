This module (authres) is designed to provide support for RFC 5451,
http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5451,  processing in Python.

It also supports Authentication Results extensions:

RFC 5617 DKIM/ADSP
RFC 6008 DKIM signature identification (header.b)
RFC 6212 Vouch By Reference (VBR)

import authres only provides the RFC 5451 types. Individual additions can be
imported by name, import authres.dkim_b, authres.dkim_adsp, authres.vbr.

This is not a final release with these new features.  They all work, but
documentation is sorely lacking.  We'll have a final version once the
documentation is done.

Header folding and unfolding is the responsibility of the calling application.

Between docstrings and RFC 5451 the API should be reasonably clear, but the
docstrings are still a work in progress.  The API is completely reworked from
version 0.1.

This package requires python2.6 or later (including python3).

This is completely untested on Windows, but in theory should work.
