Description: Collection of Qt chart widgets
        ------------------------------
        
        Provides some colourful Qt chart widgets.  Requires the PySide_ Qt
        bindings.
        
        At this time, wwchartlib provides a couple of pie chart widgets.  More
        widgets may come in time.  Feel free to contribute!
        
        ``wwchartlib.piechart.PieChart``
          A simple pie chart widget.
        
        ``wwchartlib.piechart.AdjustablePieChart``
          A pie chart whose slices are adjustable with click and drag mouse
          movement.
        
          Defines two additional signals:
        
          ``itemAdjusted``
            Emitted when an item is adjusted, with that item as the argument.
            If two slices are adjusted at the same time, two signals are
            emitted.
          ``finishedAdjusting``
            Emitted when an adjustment is finished (i.e., the user releases the
            mouse).  There are no arguments.
