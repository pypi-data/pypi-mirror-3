Description: ('Report Generation Module\n------------------------\n\nPollyReports.py provides a set of classes for database report writing.  It\nassumes that you are using Reportlab to do PDF generation, but can work with\nany "canvas-like" object as desired.\n\nPollyReports provides the following framework for report generation:\n\nA Report object has a data source bound to it at instantiation.  One or more\nBand objects (at least, a detail Band) must be added to it, and then the\ngenerate() method will be called to process the data source.  The data source\nmust be an iterator that produces objects that can be accessed via []\noperations, meaning mainly dict, list, and tuple types, i.e. the most common\ntypes of records returned by standard database modules.  The detail band is\ngenerated() once for each row.\n\nBand objects contain a list of Elements (generally at least one) which define\nhow data from the row should be printed.  An Element may print any normal data\nitem or label and may be subclassed to handle other things like images.\nGenerating a band in turn calls Element.generate() for each element, producing\na list of Renderers with the first item in the list being the overall height of\nthe band.  The height is used to decide if the band will fit on the current\npage; if not, a new page will be created first.  When the page is finally ready\nfor the band, Renderer.render() will be called for each Renderer in the element\nlist in order to actually render the data.\n\nThis version is written for Python 2.7, but should be easily adapted to Python 3.\n',)
