        YAAK stands for Yet Another Application Kit. It's a set of tools that help
        developing enterprise applications in python.
        
        ``yaak.inject`` is a package from the YAAK toolkit that provides dependency
        injection to your applications. See this `Martin Fowler's article`_ for
        an explanation of dependency injection and its usefulness when developing
        enterprise application.

        Installation
        ============
        
        You should have ``easy_install`` (from setuptools or something
        equivalent) installed on your system.
        
        To install the package, just type::
        
          $ easy_install yaak.inject
        
        You can also install the package from a source tarball. Decompress the
        source archive and type::

        Changelog
        =========
        
        0.2.1 (11-March-2012)
        ---------------------
        
        * The setup.py file does not import code anymore in order to retrieve the
          version information, since it may cause some installation problems
        * Fixed bad years in the changelog, and reordered the items so that the most
          recent changes appear first
        * Changed the aliases for releasing new versions
        * Fixed line endings (unix style)
        * Removed the extensions of the text files since it's a convention in the
          Python world.
        
        
        0.2.0 (24-Oct-2011)
        -------------------
        
        * Fixed the broken lock acquire/release implementation when updating the
          application context dictionary.
        * The locking mechanism is now available for all scopes.
        * The context manager is now responsible for updating the context dictionaries.
        * Fixed duplicate factory calls when providing a factory returning None
        * ScopeManager.enter_scope now raise a ScopeReenterError when re-entering a
          scope
        * ScopeManager.exit_scope now raise a UndefinedScopeError when exiting an
          undeclared scope
        * Fixed the API documentation
        
        
        0.1.0 (23-Oct-2011)
