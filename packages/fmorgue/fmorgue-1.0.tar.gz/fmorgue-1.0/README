File morgue (fmorgue) is a tool for mirroring files permanently to a remote server.
In contrast to rsync and friends, it identifies missing files on the server only
based on modification time and size, which makes it suitable for archiving rotated log files.

The package installs two new shell commands, 'fmorgue' for the client application, and 'fmorgue-server'.

The client application
----------------------
The fmorgue client is expected to be called on a regular base, e.g. as cron job. It inspects
the given list of files and asks the server which files need to be transfered. In case some
of the files are missing, they are immediately transferred to the server.

Example:

fmorgue http://my.archive.example.com/ /var/log/*.log

Try 'fmorgue -h'

The server application
----------------------
The fmorgue server can either run as standalone application on a dedicated port, or as CGI script.
In both modes, the server must be told were to store the retreived data.
By default, the files are renamed according to their modification time, since the original file
name is expected to be changing (think logrotate). You can add the original host name and file name
to the generated file name on server side. Please consult 'fmorgue-server -h'.

For CGI mode, you simply need to add a ScriptAlias directive to your web server configuration. 
The script configuration is then read from a local configuration file. Please consult 'fmorgue-server -h'.

Disclaimer
----------
There is no security in this application. If you expose your fmorgue-server to the Internet, you are on your own.
