1.0dev (unreleased)
-------------------

_ Alfa version
- Created recipe with ZopeSkel
ÐÊAdded content type "Boardfile"
- Added browser views
ÐÊAdded workflow "multiapprove workflow" so all "Reviewers" can "approve" or "reject" the boardfile
ÐÊAdded time based trasaction... the "Boardfile" gets published after "n" days if none of the "Reviewers" has "rejected" it.
- Added "Boardfile_listing" view. 
  Warning: This will give you an error if you use it on a folder containing something else than "Boardfiles", so it is in "skins" dir and not in ues.

To do: 
=======
ÐÊChange time to "creation date", it should take 20 days from creation, not from "last transaction in history".
ÐÊFar to much code in "browser"... could need some help here.
ÐÊTime before the transaction is now about 14 minutes (for testing), will change to 20 days.
