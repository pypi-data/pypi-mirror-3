Changelog
=========

0.3a1 (unreleased)
------------------

- Added the ``should-remove-setuptools`` convience setting to remove
  setuptools from the isolation.
- Wrote the working set filtering procedure as a funtion. Again, this piece
  was not attached to the class's internals.
- Created base classes for the recipes. The first base classes is for a generic
  recipe. The other is for the isolators, shared behavior and what not...
- Wrote to write the path file. There was no reason why this needed
  to be part of the class.
- Added a pth producer recipe. This recipe does only the pth production part
  of the isolation procedure.

0.2.0 (2010-09-05)
------------------

- Added a staging feature. This allows the recipe to build in the final
  destinations, but build the isolations within the parts directory.
- Fixed a referencing issue that had to do with the pth file's final location.
- Factored out the usage of the options object within the recipe code.

0.1.1 (2010-08-31)
------------------

- Added this changelog file.
- Fixed the source packaging by adding a manifest file.

0.1 (2010-08-31)
