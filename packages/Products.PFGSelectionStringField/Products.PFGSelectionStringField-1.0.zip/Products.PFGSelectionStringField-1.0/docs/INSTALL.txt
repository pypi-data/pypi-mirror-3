Installation
============

Use zc.buildout and the plone.recipe.zope2instance
recipe to manage packages:

* Add ``Products.PFGSelectionStringField`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.::

    [buildout]
    eggs =
        Products.PFGSelectionStringField

* Re-run buildout, e.g. with::

    ./bin/buildout


* Then Quick Install ``Products.PloneFormGen`` first before installing ``Products.PFGSelectionStringField``.
