        Here's what it should look like::
        
            = A Heading =
        
            // A comment that isn't rendered.
        
            Some explanatory text at the start of the list.
        
            This can be several paragraphs.
        
            [] A single item in a checklist
        
            Each item immediately below belongs to this comment.
            [] Item 1
            [] Item 2
            [] Item 3
        
            The following items are OR'd (rather than AND'd).
            () Item 1
            () Item 2
            () Item 3
        
            The following items have case insensitive roles assigned to them.
            [] {doctor, nurse} Check the machine that goes ping.
            [] {patient} Give consent.
            [] {surgeon} Make the incision.
            [] {cleaner} Tidy up the gore.
