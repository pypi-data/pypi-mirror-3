Release 0.3.0
=============

Features
--------

* Translate bug-links: bug IDs in the bug's description that are shown as
  links to other bugs in the web front ends. These IDs occur in the pattern
  "bug #123". This new feature translates the bug IDs so that they stay valid 
  when the bug's description is uploaded to an other repository.

* New infrastructure for converting bugs to the internal format, and for
  transforming parts of the text.

Bugs
----

* Program did crash when bugs were removed from the repository. This is even
  possible on Launchpad for bugs that are shared with other projects. The 
  program does not crash any more, and prints a warning message instead. 
  However no action is taken to correct the problem, such as removing the 
  non existing bug from the internal data structures. 


Release 0.2.0
=============

Features
--------

* Added global option ``--version``. It shows the program's version, and a
  license notice.

* Sub-command ``sync``: added option ``--dry-run`` if used, program does not
  modify the repositories, but prints what the program would normally do.
  
* Sub-command ``info``: test the repository configuration data, program tries
  anonymous login. 

* added ability to use Launchpad's test servers ("staging", "qastaging"). 
  This lead to change in file format.

* Automatically add unknown milestones to the internal data (the translator).
  This does not add a milestone to the repository itself. This will
  nevertheless make new milestones appear in Trac repositories automatically.
  Milestones only have to be put into the milestone translator explicitly, when
  you use different names for them in your repositories. The feature can be
  switched off.

* changed file format

* Better error messages for broken configuration and data files.

* more tests for high level functionality.
  
Bugs
----

* Unicode fixes

* Crash when loading broken data file.


Release 0.1.0
