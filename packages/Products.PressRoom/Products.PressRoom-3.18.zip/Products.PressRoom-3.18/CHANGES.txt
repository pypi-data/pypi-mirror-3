   Users are warned if the releases/clips/contacts folders are private, and a button

   Collections. [jbaldivieso]

   shown to anonymous users [jonstahl]

   on effective rather than the more logical storydate and releaseDate schema fields [andrewb]

   PressRelease & PressClip content types due to the sorting that's done in the default
   catalog queries [andrewb]

   testing coverage in the previous line [andrewb]

   those items [andrewb]

 - Added | between email and phone number for press contacts [jonstahl]

   resolve conflict with auto-generated listing in folder_contents [jonstahl]
