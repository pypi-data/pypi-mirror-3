        How it works
        ============
        
        .. figure:: http://keul.it/images/plone/collective.flowplayer_toolbar-0.1.0.png

           Multiple players inside a page.
        
        This product use basic feature given to you from `Flowplayer`__.
        
        __ http://flowplayer.org/
        
        You must know that installing `collective.flowplayer`__ in your Plone site give you all the
        Flowplayer power.
        Unluckily the native Flowplayer's controlsbar is *not always accessible*: recent releases sometimes
        are quite usable with keyboard, but not on every browser and not all features.
        There's a `Flowplayer plugin`__ gives you the power to create and handle the player with an alternative
        JavaScript controlsbar.
        
        __ http://pypi.python.org/pypi/collective.flowplayer
        __ http://flowplayer.org/plugins/javascript/controlbar.html
        
        This product does exactly this task. The default Flash controlsbar of the player will be
        disabled and a new, JavaScript based, ones will be shown providing some `WAI ARIA`__ attributes.
        
        __ http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/aria.php
        
        If needed you can also enable again the native Flash controlsbar (as far as only there you can access
        feature like the fullscreen view of your videos, due to security reasons).
        To do this, put to ``True`` the ``toolbar_flash_controlsbar`` property in the *flowplayer_properties*
        property sheet.
        
        The controlsbar plugin provided is not the original one you can find on Flowplayer site, but is fixed
        to be more accessible and fully *usable using keyboard*.
        
        You can move around using the *TAB* key (and *SHIFT+TAB* for moving backward) and trigger button
        with *ENTER*.
        
        When the focus is on the *slider* that indicate the video progress, you can:
        
        * move forward/back for 5 seconds with right/left keys
        * move forward/back for 1 minute with *PAGE DOWN*/*PAGE UP* keys
        * move at the beginning of the video with *HOME* key
        * move at the end of the video with *END* key
        
        If you don't care about accessibility of your videos, you don't need this package
        (but obviously you are a bad guy).
        
        Accessible slider help text
        ---------------------------
        
        When you navigate with keyboard to the slider, giving it the focus, an help tooltip will be displayed
        with instruction on how to use the slider with keyboard.

           :alt: Help on Plone 4
           
           How help text looks like (Plone 4).
        
        The help text is provided in english (default), italian and danish. To support additional languages
        you can modify the product source or (better) provide an additional Javascript registered *after* the
        flowplayer.accessible.controls.js::
        
            jQuery.flowplayer_toolbar.slider_guide.xx = {
                     intro:             'How to control the slider',
                     left_arrow_label:  'Left arrow',
                     left_arrow_help:   'backward 5 seconds',
                     right_arrow_label: 'Right arrow',
                     right_arrow_help:  'forward 5 seconds',
                     page_up_label:     'Page up',
                     page_up_help:      'backward 1 minute',
                     page_down_label:   'Page down',
                     page_down_help:    'forward 1 minute',
                     home_label:        'Home key',
                     home_help:         'go to beginning of clip',
                     end_label:         'End key',
                     end_help:          'go to end of clip'
            };
        
        Change *xx* above with the 2-letters code of your language and customize other strings.
        Language loaded is taken from the language of the site (for any problem, fallback on english).
        
        If you like, send me your translation and see them becoming part of next release.
