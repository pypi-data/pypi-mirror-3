    Adds ``edbob``-specific features to the application.  Currently this does
    two things:

    It adds a ``ZopeTransactionExtension`` instance as an extension to the
    SQLAlchemy scoped ``Session`` class.  This is necessary for most view code
    that ships with ``edbob``, so you will most likely need to specify
    ``config.include('edbob.pyramid')`` somewhere in your app config (i.e. your
    ``main()`` function).

    The other thing added is the ``edbob`` static view for CSS files etc.

    # Session is extended here instead of at module scope to prevent import
    # side-effects.
    Session.configure(extension=ZopeTransactionExtension())

    # Forbidden view is configured here instead of within edbob.pyramid.views
    # since it's so "important."
    config.add_forbidden_view('edbob.pyramid.views.forbidden')

    # Same goes with the edbob static route; we need that JS.
