pas.plugins.external_auth package installation
==============================================

We provide standard zc.buildout installation instruction.

- Add ``pas.plugins.external_auth`` to the list of eggs to install:

::

    [buildout]
    ...
    eggs =
        ...
        pas.plugins.external_auth


- If you don't use plone with z3c.autoinclude,
  tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug:

::

    [instance]
    recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
    ...
    zcml =
        pas.plugins.external_auth


- Re-run buildout, e.g. with:

::

    $ ./bin/buildout


You can skip the ZCML slug if you are going to explicitly include the package
from another package's configure.zcml file.

Installation in zope
====================

Once this is done you can use provided profiles to populate your PAS.
Two of them are provided for version 3 and 4 of Plone as default unconfigured
example. The one which is used by cmfquickinstaller is targeted at Plone 4
empty profile so you could just install the product with plone control panel.

Those profiles are more examples than real use case. They are intended to be
used as a basis for a real profile correspondig to your configuration, unless
you prefer to just use TTW ZMI configuration.
Anyway using the install product through zope for external_auth has not much
sense except for quickly evaluating the product.

Once ou have configured at least one plugin in acl_users, go into ZMI
management page of tyhis plugin and follow the main page configuration
instructions.
