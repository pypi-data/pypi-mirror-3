    A slice of an HTSQL query.

    In the process of translation of an HTSQL query to SQL, intermediary nodes
    of different kinds are generated.  Most of the nodes have a `mark`
    attribute that points to the original HTSQL expression from which the
    node was derived.

    Note that a :class:`Mark` object should only be used for presentational
    purposes such as error reporting.  There is no guarantee that the slice
    ``mark.value[mark.start:mark.end]`` would represent a valid HTSQL
    expression.

    `input` (a Unicode string)
        The HTSQL query.

    `start` (an integer)
        The beginning of the slice.

    `end` (an integer)
        The end of the slice.
