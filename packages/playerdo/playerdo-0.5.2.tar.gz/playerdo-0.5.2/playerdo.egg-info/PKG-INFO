Description: 
        So you use several media players, sometimes at the same time (like 'shell-fm'
        running in a terminal, and something else with a GUI), and sometimes you like to
        try out new media players for a while. And you want the the media buttons on
        your keyboard to Do The Right Thing without having to reprogram keyboard
        shortcuts.  This package is a solution to that problem.
        
        You can set up keyboard shortcuts to map the play/pause button to 'player_do
        playpause' etc, and player_do generally does the Right Thing.
        
        There is a command 'install_gnome' to help set up keyboard shortcuts on GNOME.
        
        The currently supported programs can be seen by running 'player_do help'. Those
        that have been tested include the following:
        
        * Audacious
        * Amarok
        * Banshee
        * Clementine
        * Exaile
        * Guayadeque
        * moc
        * Quodlibet
        * Rhythmbox
        * shell-fm
        
        Many other players will be supported due to support for the MPRIS DBUS protocol,
        without a specific backend.  If you only need support for those players,
        consider using `MPRIS-remote <http://incise.org/mpris-remote.html>`_.
        
        To add more supported programs, see the existing code in the 'backends'
        directory.  Patches gratefully received!
