Description: This library provides a framework for developing console applications using Python and curses.
        
        This framework should be powerful enough to create everything from quick, simple programs to complex, multi-screen applications. It is designed to make doing the simple tasks very quick and to take much of the pain out of writing larger applications.
        
        There is a very wide variety of default widgets - everything from simple text fields to more complex tree and grid views.
        
        I have used versions of this library for private scripts and small applications for around ten years. As a result, it is fairly mature.
