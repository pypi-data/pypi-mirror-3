Description: WSGI Party: partyline middleware for WSGI with good intentions
        ==============================================================
        
        wsgi_party's goals for Python web developers:
        
        1. Refactor legacy projects one route at a time; graft instead of rewrite.
        2. Try new ideas from meetups/conferences in isolation; increase velocity.
        3. Integrate multiple web frameworks; use the right tool for the job.
        
        wsgi_party is for WSGI framework developers. See individual frameworks and
        extensions for support. The initial intent was to build URLs across independent
        applications, but other exchanges are possible if they are supported by all
        frameworks in use.
        
        The wsgi_party module provides the WSGIParty middleware which allows all
        mounted applications to hook in handlers for cross-application communication
        within a single WSGI process. Mount individual applications in a dispatcher,
        then wrap the dispatcher with WSGIParty. Applications can then ask each other
        for information with simple in-process messages. Messages are synchronous and
        namespaced, and must be explicitly supported by Python web frameworks or their
        extensions.
