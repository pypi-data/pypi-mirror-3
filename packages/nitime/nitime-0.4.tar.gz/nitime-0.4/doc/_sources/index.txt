:mod:`Nitime` is a library for time-series analysis of data from neuroscience
experiments.  :mod:`Nitime` contains a core of numerical algorithms for
time-series analysis both in the time and spectral domains, a set of container
objects to represent time-series, and auxiliary objects that expose a high
level interface to the numerical machinery and make common analysis tasks easy
to express with compact and semantically clear code, as we will show here.
:mod:`Nitime` is one of the components of the Nipy [NiPy]_ project, an effort
to develop a set of open-source libraries for the analysis and visualization of
data from neuroimaging experiments.
