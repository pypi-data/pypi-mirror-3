--- # Experiment 02
# This file is part of FMS, a Financial Market Simulator
#
# This experiment is a special case, useful for testing purposes.
# The agent class is reading the successive orders from an orders logfile,
# as produced by more classical experiments. Thus, this is some kind of
# "replay an experiment" trick.
# The number of agents is not significant, since the agent class used
# here is a Borg : whichever the number of instances, they share the same
# environment, thus reading the logfile one line at a time, as expected.
#
# Run with :
# $ startfms.py run exp02.yml
# This should produce 1 file :
# - exp02.csv the resulting transactions file 
# This file should be identical to exp01.csv, resulting from the
# exp01.yml experiment.
