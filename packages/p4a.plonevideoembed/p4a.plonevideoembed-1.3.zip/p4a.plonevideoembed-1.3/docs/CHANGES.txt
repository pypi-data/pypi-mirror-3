------------------

Features
~~~~~~~~

  * Switched over to p4a.subtyper use
    (Rocky Burt)

  * Added smart folder criteria option for the ``object_provides`` interface
    so it's possible to add a smart folder that queries all activated links.
    To use this simply add a new smart folder and add a "Interfaces provided"
    criteria option.  Then type in the full string name of the interface
    you want to check, which in this case would be:
    ``p4a.plonevideoembed.interfaces.IVideoLinkEnhanced``
    (Rocky Burt)

  * Whenever ATLink's (and anything that provides ``IAnyVideoLinkCapable``)
    are added/modified, they are scanned to see if they contain known video
    site info, and if so, automatically activated as a video link.
    (Rocky Burt)
