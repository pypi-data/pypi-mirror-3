rstgo is a package for parsing go diagrams of the style used at the 
`Sensei's Library`_ and rendering them using reStructuredText.  It was 
designed for embedding dynamically generated images of go games into reST 
documents, particularly for pelican blogs or sphinx documentation.  

The code lives at http://bitbucket.org/cliff/rstgo.  Bug reports, feature
requests, and contributions are all welcome.  If you find the code useful,
hop on bitbucket and send me a quick message letting me know.
