        Introduction
        ============
        
        ``collective.package`` is a sample add-on package for Plone developers.
        
        Motivation
        ----------
        
        Boilerplate from template generators like ``ZopeSkel`` is nice; but not quite as
        nice as real, but still generic, examples.
        
        In the same way the collective developer's manual
        (http://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/collective.developermanual/trunk/) aims to
        document every single occurence along the way to Plone coding zen,
        ``collective.package`` aims to code it then release it as an installable add-on.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        You may install this add-on via Buildout, like so::
        
            [buildout]
            extends = http://dist.plone.org/release/4.0.2/versions.cfg
            versions = versions
            parts = plone
        
            [plone]
            recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
            user = admin:admin
            eggs = 
                Plone
                collective.package
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        This package contains code examples for common add-on package tasks in Plone.
        For example, creating a Python package that "shows up" as an installable
        add-on in the Plone control panel. Or installing an authentication plugin.
        
        Examples
        --------
        
        Here is a list of examples: 
        
        * How do I make my package "show up" in Plone? Use the ``Quick Installer`` of
          course.
        * How do I create an authentication plugin? Use the ``Pluggable Auth Service``, of
          course.
