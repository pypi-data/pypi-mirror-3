1
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:43,600
False alarm. Hold it!
It's OK, I'm here. It's all right.

2
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:48,000
- Set it down nice and easy.
- At the impound. Next time, read the sign.

3
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:52,100
You don't understand. I'm here to meet
my wife's plane. Let me have this car.

4
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:55,200
Sure. Tomorrow, 8.00 to 4.00.
Pay $40, we give it back.

5
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,400
Don't write it up!

6
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,800
This is my mother-in-law's car.
She's already mad at me cos I'm not a dentist.

7
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:06,900
- Look, I'm a cop. LAPD.
- I was in LA once. Hated it.

8
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,400
I can understand. I don't like it much...

9
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:12,500
That's a plastic fender up there. Take it easy!

10
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,700
Cut me some slack, will you?
I was a cop in New York City.

11
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:19,700
I only moved to LA cos my wife
took ajob there. What do you say?

12
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:24,900
Here we are, Washington, DC, the heart
of democracy. One hand washes the other.

13
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:29,300
- Come on, man. It's Christmas.
- So ask Santa Claus to give you another car.

14
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,500
Merry Christmas, pal.

15
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
It's all yours, Murray.

16
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:41,000
Son of a bitch.

17
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
- Hi. Where are the telephones?
- Over there.

18
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:29,900
Leonard Adkins has a story
that grows hotter by the minute.

19
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:33,900
Security was tight today
at Escalan airport in Valverde,

20
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:37,800
where it is reported that deposed general,
Ramón Esperanza,

21
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:41,400
will be delivered for extradition
to the United States.

22
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:47,000
Two years ago, the general led his country's
army against communist insurgents

23
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,200
in a campaign fought with
American money and advisers.

24
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:53,000
Esperanza's fall from power caused ripples

25
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,900
in his country's recent election,
and closer to home as well,

26
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,800
when Pentagon officials were charged
with supplying him with weapons,

27
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
despite the Congressional ban.

28
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:07,600
Evidence that Esperanza's forces violated
the neutrality of neighbouring countries

29
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,900
made Congress withhold funds.

30
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:15,300
Funds which Esperanza is accused of
replacing by going into cocaine smuggling.

31
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:19,400
Although Esperanza was removed
as commander in chief this year,

32
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:23,000
the agreement to extradite him
was only reached yesterday.

33
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:28,100
Washington insiders say a phone call
made it happen, a phone call from a...

34
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,400
All right!

35
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,700
If I could find a phone,
I'd call you, whoever you are.

36
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:16,300
Excuse me. Thank you.

37
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,500
This is Lieutenant McClane.
Somebody beep me?

38
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:32,900
- I'd like to think I'm somebody.
- Honey! Where are you? Did you land yet?

39
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,200
It's the nineties, remember?

40
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,700
Microchips, microwaves, faxes, air phones.

41
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:43,700
As far as I'm concerned,
progress peaked with frozen pizza.

42
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:47,300
Listen, we're gonna be
about half an hour late landing.

43
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,600
I just wanted to let you know. The kids OK?

44
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:55,100
They're about to lose their minds from all
the sugar your parents are giving them.

45
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:58,100
Did Mom give you a hard
time about borrowing her car?

46
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,700
No. Not yet.

47
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:04,900
Listen, honey, when you land,
can we just rent a car,

48
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:08,300
check into a hotel,
leave the kids with your parents?

49
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:13,400
Order some room service, a bottle
of champagne? What do you say?

50
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,500
You're on, Lieutenant.

51
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:18,700
I'll see you in half an hour, honey.
I love you. Bye.

52
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:26,300
Isn't technology wonderful?

53
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:30,800
- My husband doesn't think so.
- I do.

54
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,800
I used to carry around
those awful Mace things.

55
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Now...

56
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,700
I zap any bastard that screws with me.

57
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:46,300
I tried it on my little dog.

58
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,000
Poor thing limped for a week.

59
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,700
Excuse me.

60
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,800
You look really familiar to me.

61
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,200
I get that a lot. I've been on TV.

62
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,400
Yeah. Me too.

63
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,600
- Grab the tools.
- You got it.

64
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:38,200
This is Amy Nichole,
live from Escalan airport,

65
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:42,500
where deposed general, Ramón Esperanza,
has just arrived under heavy guard.

66
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,500
The deposed dictator's mood seems jubilant.

67
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:50,100
He is smiling and waving to the crowd,
like a man running for political office.

68
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,200
...thousands of political prisoners,
including the new president.

69
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:01,600
There's no doubt he still has some
ardent supporters, both here and abroad.

70
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:04,500
Rumours abound on Capitol Hill
that there were...

71
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:10,400
- Yeah?
- Sir, we're checking our equipment.

72
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:14,400
- Any problems with the conduit line?
- I don't know anything about that.

73
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:17,900
- Would you mind if we take a look?
- Help yourself.

74
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,800
It don't seem right somehow,
closing down this church.

75
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
The parish is gonna keep on using it,
but it won't be the same.

76
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,400
Been here a lot of years,
and I've been right here with it.

77
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:44,700
Yeah, I kind of feel like
a piece of me is dying with this church.

78
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,900
You're right about that.

79
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:56,200
...cocaine smuggling
and bribing government officials.

80
00:07:56,700 --> 00:08:00,700
He certainly doesn't show it,
but no matter how high his spirits,

81
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,500
they can't hide the fact that the US war
on drugs has taken its first prisoner.

82
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,800
This is Buckwheat. The clubhouse is open.

83
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,800
Here at Dulles,
the men from the Justice Department

84
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,600
wait to handcuff the man who symbolises
the enemy in America's fight against cocaine.

85
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:26,200
That battle may be almost won,
but the war is still in doubt.

86
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,500
Samantha Coleman, WNTW,
for Night-Time News.

87
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,700
Roger that, Colonel. Out.

88
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,800
That was the Colonel.

89
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,900
Everyone's in position. How's the weather?

90
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,800
We got flurries all along the Virginia coast.

91
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:59,100
New storm front coming in
from the northeast.

92
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,900
- God loves the infantry.
- Amen.

93
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:06,500
Carry out your assignments.

94
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:12,000
- 15.51. Mark.
- Check.

95
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,500
Later.

96
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:41,900
It's cold out there, man!
I stomped my feet for five minutes.

97
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:54,400
Two cappuccinos. Make it fast.

98
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,800
Excuse me, officers. This may sound like
a wild-goose chase, but I think I saw...

99
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:24,300
Saw what?

100
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:27,000
Elvis. Elvis Presley.

101
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:32,200
Fucking tourists. Ought to be a law.

102
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,100
There's a lot of you from
the Justice Department here.

103
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:39,200
- Is there any particular reason for that?
- Just routine.

104
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:42,200
- Any comment, sir?
- Not now.

105
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,900
Thank you, sir.

106
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,400
That's Colonel Stuart over there.

107
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:56,200
Got a little problem with personnel.
Last-minute replacement.

108
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,300
- How's the security here?
- Like we figured... ajoke.

109
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,500
- Colonel Stuart, could we have a few words?
- You can have two: "fuck" and "you".

110
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,800
No pictures, you pinko bitch.

111
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:12,100
Old news.

112
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,500
Hey, man.

113
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,400
- What is it?
- You got a key for this door?

114
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,300
Yeah. Why?

115
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:02,000
Because I want you to open it up, that's why.

116
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:08,200
- Is there a cop on duty around here?
- The airport police.

117
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,600
Go get 'em.

118
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:52,700
All right. Perfect. Good to go.

119
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,800
It's a restricted area. What's the matter?

120
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,400
- Couldn't wait for a skycap?
- We work here.

121
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,500
Let's see some ID.

122
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:07,600
Sure. No problem.

123
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Jeez. Fuck!

124
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,600
This is a tag team?

125
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:17,400
- He came in here and flashed a badge?
- Yeah. He said to bring you guys back here.

126
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,600
Christ.

127
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:04,900
Fucker!

128
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,100
Freeze!

129
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,800
Nice guess, asshole.
I'm a cop. That was the bad guy.

130
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:15,100
Where's your ID?

131
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,800
On its way to Cleveland?

132
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:31,000
You did not explain anything. You just
shoved me back here into this cattle car.

133
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:35,200
- Sir, you were told we were overbooked.
- Fine. I accept that.

134
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:38,600
But why can't I get the first-class
meal my network paid for?

135
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,700
- Do you know who I am?
- Yes. We've seen your programme.

136
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:46,000
Your episode "Flying Junkyards" was
an objective look at air-traffic safety.

137
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:50,300
It wasn't nearly as edifying as
"Bimbos of the Sky", was it, Connie?

138
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:53,400
You think you're funny.

139
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:56,800
Fine. I've got your number.

140
00:16:56,900 --> 00:17:00,400
And I've got yours. So park it, sir.

141
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,800
Fine.

142
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,000
- Stewardess.
- Mr Thornberg.

143
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:18,200
You cannot monopolise my time.

144
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,200
- You cannot put me near that woman.
- Excuse me?

145
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:26,800
He means he's filed
a restraining order against me.

146
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,300
I'm not allowed within 50 feet of him.

147
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:35,100
50 yards. So by keeping me in this
section, you are violating a court order.

148
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:38,500
I can sue you and this airline.

149
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:42,200
That woman assaulted me,
and she humiliated me in public.

150
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,500
What did you do?

151
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,800
Knocked out two of his teeth.

152
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,900
Would you like some champagne?

153
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:05,300
Sorry, Officer McClane. I had to check.

154
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,500
Here's your piece and shield back.

155
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,000
Thanks.

156
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,900
Jesus! Christ!

157
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:23,600
What the fuck are you people...
What are you doing?

158
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:26,700
This is a crime scene.
You gotta seal this area off.

159
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:31,200
- That's up to the captain.
- Maybe you better take me up to the captain.

160
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:45,100
- Where's Cochrane?
- He didn't make it.

161
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:58,600
- You're late.
- We ran into trouble, Colonel.

162
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:04,100
Some cop killed Cochrane.
I barely got away, sir.

163
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:06,300
Did you accomplish your mission?

164
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,800
Yes, sir, but... Cochrane, sir.

165
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:13,400
Then the damage is minimal.
The penalty could be severe.

166
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:25,300
You fail me again,
and the chamber won't be empty.

167
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:29,100
Dismissed.

168
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,300
Who is it? Come in.

169
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:50,500
- Captain Lorenzo?
- Yeah.

170
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:53,200
- I'm John McClane...
- I know who you are.

171
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:58,000
You're the asshole thatjust broke seven FAA
and five District of Columbia regulations

172
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:01,600
running around my airport
with a gun, shooting at people.

173
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:04,600
- What do you call that shit?
- Self-defence.

174
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:09,800
You think that LA badge is gonna get you
a free lunch or something around here?

175
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,700
No. Maybe a little professional courtesy.

176
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:17,400
In an airport on Christmas week?
You gotta be kidding.

177
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:20,300
OK, fuck courtesy.
How about being professional?

178
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:23,300
Your boys just walked away
from a crime scene.

179
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,600
You can't wrap this up in ten minutes.

180
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:29,800
- You got to seal the area off, dust for prints...
- Don't lecture me, hotshot.

181
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,100
I know what I'm doing.
We're gonna dust it down.

182
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:36,200
We'll take all the pictures.
We'll sweep for fibres.

183
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:41,000
After 400 people go through there? You'd be
lucky to get a print from one of your people.

184
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:44,300
- Just shut down that area...
- Shut the area down?

185
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,800
It's that simple? Just shut the area down?

186
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:50,300
I got everybody
from the Shriners' convention

187
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:53,200
to the goddamn Boy Scouts in here.

188
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:56,700
I got lost kids, lost dogs...
Not now. Later!

189
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,900
I got international diplomats.

190
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:03,100
I got a fuckin' reindeer flying in here
from the fuckin' petting zoo.

191
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:06,500
But John McClane, he's got a little problem.

192
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,900
Let's shut down the whole fuckin' airport.

193
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:13,300
- What do you think they'll say upstairs?
- Phone and find out.

194
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:18,800
I don't need fuckin' forensics to tell me
this was some punk stealing luggage!

195
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,800
Luggage? That punk pulled a Glock 7 on me.
That's a porcelain gun made in Germany.

196
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,900
It doesn't show up on X-ray machines
and it costs more than you make in a month.

197
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:32,100
- You'd be surprised what I make in a month.
- If it's more than $1.98...

198
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,700
Hey, McClane, don't start
believing your own press.

199
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:38,900
Yeah, I know all about you
and that Nakatomi thing in LA.

200
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:43,300
Butjust cos the TV thinks
you're hot shit, that don't make it so.

201
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:46,100
Look, you are in my little pond now,

202
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,200
and I am the big fish that runs it.

203
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,900
So you capped some lowlife. Fine.

204
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I'll send your fuckin' captain in LA
a fuckin' commendation.

205
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:01,900
Now, get the hell out of my office before I
have you thrown out of my goddamn airport.

206
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:15,500
Carmine, let me ask you something.

207
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:20,200
What sets off the metal detectors first? The
lead in your ass or the shit in your brains?

208
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:23,400
Fat fuck.

209
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:35,500
- Any ID on this guy?
- That's somebody else's problem.

210
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,200
I need to borrow this and this.
I'll bring it right back.

211
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:49,300
Hold up!

212
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,200
Hold up, boys. We gotta check something.

213
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:58,600
- What are you doing?
- Pretty gruesome fuckin' job.

214
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:04,300
All the confusion in there,
forgot to get this clown's prints.

215
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:09,900
- Christ.
- You're supposed to do that at the morgue.

216
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:13,500
Not any more. Got a new SOP
for DOAs from the FAA.

217
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,800
I don't think this one's gonna make it.
Thanks a lot.

218
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:18,100
- Powell here.
- Take that Twinkie out of your mouth.

219
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:22,100
- John, how ya doing?
- Holly stood me up a day

220
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:25,400
and I'm here alone in DC with my in-laws.

221
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:31,000
The old in-laws? Man, they do love
their policemen son-in-laws.

222
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:35,600
Listen, Al, what is the fax machine
telephone number there at the station?

223
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:41,900
5553212.

224
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,500
3212. Hold on a second, all right?
I wanna send you something.

225
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,000
Excuse me.

226
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,900
You and faxes? This is a first.

227
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:54,400
Holly told me I should wake up
and smell the nineties.

228
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:57,000
- This way?
- No. That way.

229
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,500
- It's upside down.
- It doesn't matter.

230
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,600
Here it comes.

231
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:07,100
- I'm sending you something now.
- Hold on a second, cowboy.

232
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:26,100
- Fingerprints?
- We've got an unidentified stiff.

233
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:29,200
I've circled the whorls
in case the transmission's fuzzy.

234
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:32,200
Run it through State and Federal,
and maybe Interpol.

235
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:36,100
- Will do. What's this about?
- Just a feeling I have.

236
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Ouch. When you get those feelings,
insurance companies start to go bankrupt.

237
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:45,200
- The fax number is...
- On the top of the transmission you just got.

238
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:48,000
On the top of the transmission you just got.

239
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:55,500
An airport? You're not
pissing in somebody's pool?

240
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Yeah, and I'm fresh out of chlorine.

241
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,600
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

242
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,800
Just as this storm starts breaking,

243
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,300
the satellite-feed up
and drops the other shoe on us.

244
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:16,200
Look at this new front moving in.
Makes its baby brother look like chickenshit.

245
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:21,300
I can sand down the runways
and run the ploughs between landings

246
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:24,100
but you gotta downshift them,
give me time to work.

247
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,300
You got it.

248
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:32,700
All right, everyone. Let's slow down our birds
before we get a parking lot over our heads.

249
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:37,600
The line starts at the Mississippi,
and they better start taking numbers.

250
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,800
Can I get you another?

251
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:56,100
No, thank you. I only have to look
at his face for another 20 minutes.

252
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:02,900
This is the captain speaking. I've just
been informed by Dulles traffic control

253
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,000
that there's a weather front ahead of us.

254
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:09,100
We may be up here a little while longer.

255
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:11,900
- Thank you.
- On second thought...

256
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:25,200
I'm right here, partner.
Your stiff's dossier is coming through now.

257
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:30,200
- What can you tell me about him?
- He's dead.

258
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:34,600
- You needed a computer to figure that out?
- No, you don't follow me.

259
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:38,500
According to the Department of Defense,
he's been dead for two years.

260
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:42,600
- What?
- That's right. Sergeant Oswald Cochrane.

261
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:45,600
American adviser in Honduras.

262
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:48,100
Killed in a helicopter accident, 5-11-88.

263
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,900
Officer.

264
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,500
Read between the lines
and it looks like a lot of black-bag stuff.

265
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:57,300
I see it. All right, Al. Thanks a lot.

266
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:59,700
- Any time.
- OK.

267
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:05,600
I close in about an hour.
Maybe we can go get a drink?

268
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:11,300
Just the fax, ma'am.

269
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:19,500
Wait a second, I see somebody.
I'll call you back.

270
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,100
The ghost of Christmas past.
Nakatomi? LA? You're John McClane, right?

271
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:33,800
- Who are you?
- Sam Coleman. WNTW News.

272
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:37,400
- Excuse me.
- Give me a break. I saw the stiff.

273
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:39,700
Word is, that was your handiwork.

274
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:42,500
No. I only do needlepoint.

275
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:51,400
Great. National just shut down. Totally iced.

276
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:54,600
- They'll send us their planes.
- Happy holiday.

277
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:57,000
The worst part, Mr Trudeau, is the press.

278
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:00,000
They were here for the Esperanza story,

279
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:03,200
so they got it right on the news,
bloodstains and all.

280
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:06,800
I'd like to lock every damn reporter
out of the airport,

281
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:11,500
but they'd pull that freedom-of-speech crap
on us, then the ACLU would be all over us.

282
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,700
Murder on television.
Hell of a start for Christmas week.

283
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:19,500
What is it? A gang thing like last time?

284
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,400
Only if your gangs get
their training at Fort Bragg.

285
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,300
- Who the hell is this?
- I'm a police officer...

286
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:30,500
In an unauthorised area.
LA, Mr Trudeau, don't mean shit.

287
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,500
That's what I said about
my last cholesterol test.

288
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:37,100
So what's your problem,
Lieutenant McClane?

289
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:43,500
I'm sure Captain Lorenzo has explained to
you the minor fracas with the minor thieves.

290
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,100
Maybe he can explain this.

291
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:07,300
- All systems tapped, Colonel.
- Fire it up.

292
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:25,200
H minus five minutes. Stand by.

293
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:31,100
We've got a body in the morgue
that seems to have died twice.

294
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:34,000
Assuming it's not an error,
what do we assume?

295
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:38,400
- Somebody's about to fuck with this airport.
- What the hell does that mean?

296
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:42,300
I know we're dummies up here,
so give us a taste of your genius.

297
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,500
A hijacking, a robbery or what?

298
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:46,900
- I'm not sure...
- He's not sure.

299
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:49,600
I'm stunned. I gotta lie down.

300
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:53,600
Only professionals go to this much trouble.
Not luggage thieves or punks.

301
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:56,900
- Professional at what?
- What the fuck do you think this is?

302
00:31:57,100 --> 00:32:00,600
The safety patrol? This is the résumé
of a professional mercenary.

303
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:04,400
A major drug dealer is due here.
You need a slide rule to solve this,

304
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:07,300
or another body in a bag
before you ask questions?

305
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,800
You're the one that gave us
that fucking body. Remember that.

306
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,400
Yeah, I remember that.

307
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:22,900
Lorenzo, have all your
shift commanders report in. Now.

308
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,500
- What?
- They're to report anything unusual,

309
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:29,600
- no matter how trivial. Got that?
- I got it.

310
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,400
- My God.
- What?

311
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:35,500
- The runways. Look.
- What the hell?

312
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:38,200
- They're shutting down.
- Jesus Christ.

313
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,600
Go to emergency lighting. Now.

314
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:51,500
- Emergency. We are in a code yellow.
- Backup systems won't come up.

315
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:54,800
- Shunt to another terminal.
- Bobby, what have you got?

316
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,200
- The network is down.
- Should we call the power company?

317
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,500
We're on the same grid and we're hot.

318
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,400
Dulles, I'm on approach.

319
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:05,700
- Maintain position. Repeat.
- What's going on down there?

320
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:08,400
- We're on it.
- We're unable right now. Delay.

321
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:13,000
Fuji 604. Execute published
missed-approach procedure and hold.

322
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,000
TWA 23, unable to clear you
for approach at this time.

323
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:18,500
Climb to and maintain one zero thousand.

324
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,700
I've checked all systems. It ain't happening.

325
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:40,000
- What's it look like?
- Approach control is gone.

326
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:42,900
Jesus. Instrument landing system is down.

327
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:46,700
Confirmed. ILS is dead.

328
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:50,200
Every goddamn system's dead.
And Inmac monitors are down.

329
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:59,300
Attention all controllers.
We have a code-red alert.

330
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:04,400
Every aircraft approaching our sector,
and not already in our landing pattern,

331
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:07,500
gets diverted to their alternate airport.

332
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:11,800
Everyone already on approach,
or inside our pattern,

333
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,500
holds at the outer markers.

334
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:17,400
Stack 'em, pack 'em and rack 'em. Move.

335
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:26,200
Not a word of this leaves this room.

336
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:30,200
There must be 15,000 people in
this airport, and we don't need panic.

337
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:34,400
We just bought ourselves maybe two hours.

338
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:37,500
After that, planes low on fuel
won't be circling.

339
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:40,200
They'll be dropping on the White House lawn.

340
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:45,300
McClane, this what you expected?

341
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:49,400
No.

342
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:52,000
This is just the beginning.

343
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:58,100
- FAA hot line.
- How could they know already?

344
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,400
They can't.

345
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:05,800
- Maybe it's the boys who pulled your plugs.
- Put it on speaker.

346
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,800
Attention, Dulles tower. Attention.

347
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,500
They say blind men become very
attentive by way of compensation.

348
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:17,900
Now that you're blind and deaf,
I think I've got your attention.

349
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:21,600
I'm aware your recorders are active,
so I'll be quick.

350
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:24,100
You can play me back
to your heart's content.

351
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,700
How did you get on this line? Who is this?

352
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,700
Who I am is unimportant. What I want...

353
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,900
If you don't want planes to splash into
the Potomac as they run out of fuel,

354
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,400
what I want is very important.

355
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:41,500
A plane will be landing
at this airport in 58 minutes.

356
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:44,800
It is FM-1: Foreign Military One.

357
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:48,300
- I'm sure you are aware of the nature
- Esperanza?

358
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:51,300
of this flight, the importance of its cargo.

359
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,700
This plane will not be met by anyone.

360
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:58,100
It will land on a runway of my designation,

361
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:01,300
where it will remain isolated
and unapproached.

362
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:06,100
That will conclude my interest in this
aircraft and your responsibility for it.

363
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:11,800
At the same time, I want a 747 cargo
conversion fully fuelled

364
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:14,600
and placed at my disposal.

365
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:19,100
You have two minutes to advise inbound
aircraft to hold at their outer radio marker.

366
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:22,400
After that, you will be able to receive only.

367
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:27,000
Any attempt to restore your systems,
will be met by severe penalties.

368
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,600
He's bluffing.

369
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:33,000
- Damn it, you can't do this.
- I am doing this.

370
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:45,700
I need you to punch up a code 15.
I got an idea, and I need your help.

371
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:50,200
If Esperanza gets to a country with
no extradition treaties, we're fucked.

372
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:53,500
They're talking to us on our system.
They gotta be close.

373
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:57,200
- My men will tear this airport apart.
- Just in the nick of time.

374
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:02,200
I got a first-class unit, SWAT team and all. We
don't need Monday morning quarterbacks.

375
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:07,400
My wife's on one of the planes they're
fucking with! So I'm on the playing field.

376
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:10,600
If you'd have moved before,
we wouldn't be deep in shit.

377
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:13,100
That's it. Security. You're outta here.

378
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,800
Mr Trudeau, there are FAA regulations

379
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:19,100
regarding unauthorised personnel
in the control tower!

380
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:23,900
- We just have to find a way to transmit.
- Run down to Radio Shack for a transmitter.

381
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,700
We have one - the terminal wing
they're building.

382
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:31,900
20 airlines when it's done, all with reservation
computers in a nice antenna arrangement.

383
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:35,800
- See Mr McClane out.
- You got no business being up here.

384
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:38,700
Everything we need
is by the annexe skywalk,

385
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:41,300
just sitting there, waiting to go on line.

386
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:44,400
Goddamn it, Trudeau,
you're dealing with pros.

387
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,700
You can't fuck with these people.

388
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:50,400
Sam Coleman. WNTW News.
There are a lot of rumours flying around...

389
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,900
No way, lady. Hell, no.

390
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,200
This is off limits, Coleman.

391
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:59,800
Anything you can think of,
they'll think of, too!

392
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,500
- Get your fucking hands off me.
- Just get 'em out of here.

393
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:08,000
- Lobby security, come in.
- Tomalson here.

394
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:11,900
This is Captain Lorenzo. We've two
unauthorised personnel in the tower.

395
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:15,200
Get your thumb out of your ass.
Get 'em out of the elevator,

396
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:17,700
or you'll get a pink slip for Christmas.

397
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:19,900
10-4. Let's go.

398
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:22,900
Goddamn!

399
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:26,900
- Anything who can think of?
- Shit. Hang on over there.

400
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,800
- What for?
- Just hang on!

401
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:33,800
Big drug dealer on his way to prison.
Gunfight at airport.

402
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:38,000
Every controller in the coffee shop
getting beeped, and you rocking the boat.

403
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:42,500
- Connection? Come on, just a few words.
- OK, just a few words. Fuck off.

404
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:45,900
Thanks, but I already got
that from Colonel Stuart.

405
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:51,700
Stuart. The guy that got canned
by Congress. That's who he was.

406
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:54,200
Who he who? What?

407
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,400
It's OK, I've done this before.

408
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,700
- Hey.
- Hi.

409
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:13,000
- Where's the other one?
- Claustrophobic, I guess.

410
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:17,700
It's a VHF system,
but the planes are so close, it's OK.

411
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:21,700
I can rig our frequency in 30 minutes,
and wire in a crossover.

412
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:25,900
- You wouldn't know the difference.
- Get what you need. Borrow. Steal. Kill.

413
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:28,200
I want my SWAT team
to go with him as cover.

414
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:31,400
Whatever we can think of,
they can think of, too.

415
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:39,500
Man, I can't fucking believe this.

416
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:42,400
Another basement. Another elevator.

417
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:45,300
How can the same shit happen
to the same guy twice?

418
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,800
What the fuck?

419
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:46,000
Who are you?

420
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:50,300
I'm Marvin.

421
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:53,700
I thought you was trying to steal my records.

422
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,800
I'm just the janitor.

423
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:06,600
This is Dulles approach to all aircraft
holding at Potomac vortex.

424
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:09,500
We are experiencing
some technical problems.

425
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:12,300
Weather conditions, which have deteriorated,

426
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:16,200
have now been complicated
by an unforeseen human factor.

427
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:22,200
This has affected all of our electronic
equipment and their redundant backups.

428
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,000
As a result, our nav
and approach systems are down.

429
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:28,600
We expect to lose voice in another minute.

430
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:34,900
Continue holding at the outer marker as
directed, and wait for further instructions.

431
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:40,400
As soon as we're back on line, we'll expedite
your landings on a fuel-emergency basis.

432
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,400
Good luck.

433
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
God bless.

434
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:55,500
Change the boards.

435
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,500
- The skywalk annexe.
- No! The annexe skywalk.

436
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:30,700
It's the last thing I heard
before they kicked me out.

437
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:33,400
Let me see here.

438
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:36,500
This must be it right there. See?

439
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:41,200
That's the raised platform and there's
the new terminal. There's your skywalk.

440
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:44,700
Goddamn bottleneck.
Nice place for an ambush.

441
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:50,400
What's the fastest way
you can get me out to that spot?

442
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:55,400
This kind of thing wasn't
in my job description.

443
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:59,400
- Mr Barnes, we'll watch your back.
- Yeah? Who watches yours?

444
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:13,600
Main ventilation duct.

445
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:17,800
Ventilation duct... and bingo.

446
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Just once, I'd like
a regular, normal Christmas.

447
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:27,700
Eggnog, a fucking Christmas tree,

448
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:31,400
a little turkey.

449
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:36,500
But, no. I gotta crawl around
in this motherfuckin' tin can.

450
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:44,500
We're in the annexe skywalk.
I can see the array.

451
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:48,600
I'll give you a call for a protocol test
when it's hot. That's all for now.

452
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:53,900
Sergeant, we need more equipment.
I'd like to send one of your guys for it.

453
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:02,200
- What the hell's going on?
- Put that back on!

454
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:09,500
- Hey, asshole, what do I look like to you?
- A sitting duck.

455
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:16,200
Shit!

456
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:20,000
Damn it. I hate it when I'm right.

457
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:08,600
Stay down!

458
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:24,900
Fuck.

459
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:58,200
Fucking son of a bitch.

460
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:14,700
Shit.

461
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:28,100
I'm gonna kick your fuckin' ass.

462
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:04,400
- Jeez.
- You all right?

463
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:08,300
Yeah. But the antenna array,
I gotta get to it and set it up.

464
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:15,600
Get down!

465
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Goddamn.

466
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:40,100
Bait.

467
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:44,300
Jerk us off.

468
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:46,800
Make Lorenzo sacrifice his best men.

469
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:54,400
Make you waste your time.

470
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:57,900
Time we don't have.

471
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:14,900
I think you're closer than 50 yards.

472
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:18,200
So's that airplane. Practically.

473
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:22,400
Yeah. There's quite a few of them.
It looks like a regular traffic jam.

474
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:24,700
There's nothing regular about it.

475
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:30,000
See? You're intrigued.
That's my gift, Mrs McClane. I notice things.

476
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:34,900
Things other people wouldn't see.
That's how I make people curious.

477
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:37,900
Don't you mean nauseous?

478
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:43,300
The people have a right to know everything
about everybody. You got in the way of that.

479
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:46,300
Listen, buster. You endangered my children.

480
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:49,900
You didn't do it
for anything as noble as "the people".

481
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:55,000
The only time you see the people is when you
look down to see what you're stepping on.

482
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:03,500
Me? I'll live,
but Lorenzo's SWAT team is dead

483
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:05,800
and the antenna array is gone.

484
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:09,100
Didn't you see it?

485
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:13,100
Start looking for a new miracle.

486
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:21,400
Hold for a second. Something's going on.

487
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:25,600
I say again, annexe team, give us a sit rep.

488
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:28,300
Annexe team, come in. Do you copy?

489
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:33,700
It's got a scrambler on it.
Can you do anything with it?

490
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:39,100
No. This scramble mode
must activate on this code panel.

491
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:43,500
Even if we scan their frequency,
we can't listen in. These guys are pros.

492
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:46,500
So are you. Break the code.
I wanna hear these bastards.

493
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:49,700
This is a ten-digit control panel.
Six-digit read-out.

494
00:50:50,100 --> 00:50:52,700
Hell, there could be a million combinations.

495
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:56,400
Next time you kill one of these guys,
get him to enter the code first.

496
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:04,600
Sir, we monitored a call from their chief
engineer. We took out their SWAT team.

497
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:07,800
So they did go for the antenna array.
We're on schedule.

498
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,200
Losing our team wasn't part of the plan.

499
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:20,200
Attention, Dulles control tower.

500
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:23,100
Mr Trudeau, I know you're listening.

501
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:26,800
- Unfortunately, you're not obeying.
- Try me face to face.

502
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,300
You were warned
not to restore your systems.

503
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:33,100
You've wasted lives and precious time
on a futile and obvious target.

504
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Now you're gonna pay the penalty.

505
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:40,100
I got five dead officers, Colonel Stuart.
Isn't that penalty enough?

506
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:43,300
McClane, keep out of this.
You've been a pain...

507
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:48,800
McClane. John McClane.

508
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:54,000
The policeman hero who saved
the Nakatomi hostages.

509
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:58,300
I read about you in People magazine.
You seemed out of your league on Nightline.

510
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:03,300
Colonel, blow me. How much drug money
is Esperanza paying you to turn traitor?

511
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:08,800
Cardinal Richelieu said it best:
"Treason is merely a matter of dates."

512
00:52:09,100 --> 00:52:13,700
This country's got to learn it can't keep
cutting the legs off of men like Esperanza.

513
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:17,800
Men who have the guts to stand up
against communist aggression.

514
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:23,500
Lesson one starts with killing policemen?
What's lesson two, the neutron bomb?

515
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:29,100
No. I think we can find something in-between.

516
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:32,800
Watch this.

517
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:37,000
Give me a flight number.
One that's low on fuel.

518
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:42,100
Windsor 114. Transatlantic from London.
Fuel tank's dry as a martini.

519
00:52:43,100 --> 00:52:49,900
Activate the ILS landing system, but
recalibrate sea level... minus 200 feet.

520
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:18,000
Jesus. They've reset
ground level, minus 200 feet.

521
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:23,800
Windsor flight 114. This is
Dulles approach. Do you copy?

522
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:28,000
Dulles approach, this is Windsor 114.
Where the devil have you been?

523
00:53:28,300 --> 00:53:32,400
Windsor 114.
We've been right here all along, old buddy.

524
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:35,400
Our systems only came back on line just now.

525
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:41,800
Windsor 114, you are cleared
for ILS approach, runway two-niner.

526
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:46,300
- Contact Dulles at the outer marker.
- Jesus Christ, he's gonna crash the plane.

527
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:51,300
Roger, approach, and about time. I've got
230 people up here flying on petrol fumes.

528
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:54,700
Roger, 114. Understand. Calibrate Dulles...

529
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:57,500
- Jesus.
- They'll fly right into the concrete.

530
00:53:57,700 --> 00:53:59,600
Son of a bitch!

531
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:02,700
- Why are they listening to him?
- It's our frequency.

532
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:05,300
Damn.

533
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:09,900
- Barnes.
- This is Dulles tower. We have radar contact...

534
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:12,700
Give me your coat.

535
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:16,500
- What are you gonna do?
- Whatever I can.

536
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:23,500
Ladies and gentlemen,
we've started our descent.

537
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:27,900
Sorry for the inconvenience,
but we'll all be on the ground shortly.

538
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:30,200
Please keep your seat belts on.

539
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:35,200
We've made arrangements for your
next flight, so you won't miss it.

540
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,400
In your seat, please.

541
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:45,200
We're just like British Rail, love.
We may be late, but we get you there.

542
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:47,400
Don't worry.

543
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:05,500
Good luck, McClane!

544
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:31,300
Dulles, this is Windsor 114
inside the outer marker.

545
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:34,800
Roger, 114. This is Dulles tower.

546
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,200
We have radar contact and show you on ILS.

547
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:39,800
You're in the glide path and looking good.

548
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:51,500
There's somebody out there!

549
00:55:55,700 --> 00:55:58,600
It's McClane. Christ.

550
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:06,000
Approach flaps.

551
00:56:06,700 --> 00:56:10,000
Approach speed 140.

552
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,800
130.

553
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:15,900
- Altitude 1,000 feet.
- 800, guys. You're only at 800 feet.

554
00:56:16,100 --> 00:56:19,800
Fire and rescue. Roll everything
onto runway two-niner.

555
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:24,400
Ref speed plus 20. 600 feet.

556
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:30,600
Looking good, Windsor. Watch it.
30-knot crosswinds and the runway is icy.

557
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:34,700
Attaboy. We've gotcha.

558
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,100
We've gotcha.

559
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:50,700
Pull it up!

560
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,800
Jesus!

561
00:57:08,100 --> 00:57:09,700
We've gotcha.

562
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:38,600
God.

563
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:44,700
Motherfucker.

564
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:08,800
That concludes our object lesson
for this evening.

565
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,300
If the 747 we requested is ready on time

566
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:14,700
and General Esperanza's plane
arrives unmolested,

567
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,200
further lessons can be avoided.

568
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:19,300
Out.

569
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:08,600
We got no sign of survivors.
It's a goddamn nightmare.

570
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:26,300
Barnes! We've got to warn those planes

571
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:30,900
there's a lunatic pretending
he's the tower. Get me on the air.

572
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:33,200
- How?
- You figure it out!

573
00:59:33,900 --> 00:59:36,000
Here's the manifest.

574
00:59:55,700 --> 00:59:57,700
I know how you must feel.

575
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:05,800
I wanted to help those people tonight.

576
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:09,400
I was pretty goddamn useless.

577
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:18,300
We called the government for help.
They're gonna send in a Special army unit.

578
01:00:19,900 --> 01:00:21,900
A counterterrorist team.

579
01:00:29,300 --> 01:00:32,100
Your wife's plane...

580
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:35,500
They're still broadcasting,
even though we can't answer.

581
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,400
They're gonna run out of fuel in 90 minutes.

582
01:00:52,700 --> 01:00:55,400
Listen, Dick. That is your name?

583
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:01,900
Dick. If you're gonna continue to get
this close, could you switch aftershaves?

584
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:05,900
Anything else?

585
01:01:06,100 --> 01:01:08,500
Stronger mouthwash might be nice.

586
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:11,900
Sam Coleman is reporting
live from the accident.

587
01:01:12,100 --> 01:01:16,000
Colonel, they've done
everything we've anticipated... so far.

588
01:01:16,300 --> 01:01:19,100
But still there has been no official word.

589
01:01:19,300 --> 01:01:23,400
Despite the fact that only one runway
has been closed due to the tragedy,

590
01:01:23,700 --> 01:01:27,800
several dozen airliners are visible,
endlessly circling the field.

591
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:33,900
Other reports say there had been trouble in
the tower, and that may have contributed to it.

592
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:36,700
With weather conditions worsening,

593
01:01:36,900 --> 01:01:39,800
the problem here and in
the sky above us will grow.

594
01:01:40,100 --> 01:01:43,400
I'm Samantha Coleman
at Dulles International Airport.

595
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,500
- Victor.
- Yeah, what's up?

596
01:01:53,700 --> 01:01:56,800
Did you pack the radio mikes
from the shoot or are they here?

597
01:01:57,100 --> 01:02:00,700
- I wouldn't let those assholes check 'em in!
- I love you.

598
01:02:00,900 --> 01:02:02,900
Give me one of the receivers.

599
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:09,500
Can you tune into the cockpit frequency?

600
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:13,200
- Yeah. Why?
- I wanna hear what's going on.

601
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:18,800
Should be right here on our band.

602
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:22,200
- Nothing.
- You said it would work. Is it working?

603
01:02:22,300 --> 01:02:26,600
It is working, but all I'm getting
is some kind of airport beacon.

604
01:02:26,900 --> 01:02:29,500
It's weird. It's like the tower isn't there.

605
01:02:32,700 --> 01:02:34,700
Stay on it.

606
01:02:35,700 --> 01:02:38,400
Let me know when there is something there.

607
01:03:17,300 --> 01:03:19,800
- Major Grant.
- Rollins, Department of Justice.

608
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
Trudeau, Chief of Air Operations.

609
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:25,900
Lorenzo, Terminal Police.
You want something, you got it.

610
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:29,000
This is it? One fucking platoon?

611
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:32,700
- One crisis, one platoon. Who are you?
- John McClane.

612
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:36,800
- You showed some balls out there.
- Yeah.

613
01:03:37,100 --> 01:03:40,800
Now show some good sense.
Let the pros handle this.

614
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,900
Looks like the pros
are on the wrong team tonight.

615
01:03:44,100 --> 01:03:47,400
- Isn't Colonel Stuart one of your men?
- Not any more.

616
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:51,500
We're here to take Colonel Stuart down.
And we will take him down.

617
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:54,900
I served with him.
I taught him everything he knows.

618
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:58,700
Maybe he's learned
a few more things since then.

619
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:04,300
Let's hustle. The command post will be
set up in the airport police station.

620
01:04:04,600 --> 01:04:07,400
I wanna be tied in to the tower in 15 minutes.

621
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:09,600
Let's do it!

622
01:04:14,900 --> 01:04:16,900
Things just get better or worse?

623
01:04:21,300 --> 01:04:25,200
- Lights. Big, portable lights.
- We set up the field, and then we...

624
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:29,600
Wait for those lunatics to shoot 'em out?
Where do we get the lights? From Batman?

625
01:04:29,700 --> 01:04:34,000
- What about the air phone idea?
- 18 planes are up there. Five have phones.

626
01:04:34,300 --> 01:04:36,900
We got through to three.
We're trying the others.

627
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,800
That's 13 accidents waiting to happen.

628
01:04:40,100 --> 01:04:43,200
Headwinds are slamming everybody
over the outer marker.

629
01:04:43,300 --> 01:04:47,900
The planes with enough fuel have been
shunted to Atlanta, Memphis and Nashville.

630
01:04:48,100 --> 01:04:50,500
Outer marker. Damn!

631
01:04:51,500 --> 01:04:53,600
The outer marker!

632
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:58,100
It's a beacon. It sends out this "beep
beep beep" so they know they're over it.

633
01:04:58,400 --> 01:05:01,100
- So?
- Who says that signal has to just beep?

634
01:05:01,300 --> 01:05:06,300
Right. Switch the frequency from the tower to
the one in the beacon. Pump up the wattage.

635
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:10,400
We can talk to our planes, and those
bastards who did this will never know!

636
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:16,100
Traced the signal.
Found it in the luggage area.

637
01:05:16,300 --> 01:05:19,100
They've been tapped into
your tower chatter all night.

638
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:21,600
Punks stealing luggage, Carmine?

639
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:27,600
- How you doin', Telford?
- No good.

640
01:05:27,700 --> 01:05:31,100
I called Lang. They'll have
a portable decoder here in two hours.

641
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:35,000
- My wife doesn't have two hours.
- I was put on Grant's team yesterday.

642
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:37,800
The regular guy got appendicitis.

643
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:41,400
Word is, nobody's better
at this than Major Grant.

644
01:05:41,700 --> 01:05:44,100
Except maybe Colonel Stuart.

645
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:48,300
I wanna hear about
the plane those bastards asked for.

646
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:52,000
Then I'll fill you in on my orders.
Pilots' briefing room - now!

647
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:55,500
- Keep working.
- Albertson. With me!

648
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
No civilians.

649
01:06:12,900 --> 01:06:15,000
- What the fuck...
- What is it?

650
01:06:16,900 --> 01:06:20,100
The outer marker beeper isn't beeping.
It's talking.

651
01:06:21,100 --> 01:06:25,600
All aircraft in Dulles landing pattern.
This is chief engineer, Leslie Barnes.

652
01:06:25,900 --> 01:06:29,000
I have been authorised to brief you in full.

653
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:32,200
At this time, this is the only
channel available to us.

654
01:06:33,700 --> 01:06:37,800
Here is the situation.
Approximately two hours ago...

655
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:44,700
- Get a load of this.
...claiming to be from our tower

656
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:48,200
unless you hear
your flight recorder access code.

657
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:51,400
- The terrorists have got all...
- Holy shit! Get this on tape.

658
01:06:51,700 --> 01:06:54,000
...control of everything except this channel.

659
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:56,200
Give us a second here, please.

660
01:06:58,900 --> 01:07:04,300
Do not attempt to reply on your
own frequencies to this broadcast.

661
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:06,600
They have already caused one crash

662
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:09,900
- by impersonating our tower.
- Jesus.

663
01:07:20,100 --> 01:07:24,500
Repeat. The terrorists have cut off
the two systems that allow you to land,

664
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:28,900
field lights for a visual landing
and the ILS for an instrument.

665
01:07:29,100 --> 01:07:33,400
A Special US army unit is here,
preparing to take out the terrorists.

666
01:07:33,700 --> 01:07:35,400
My God.

667
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:41,000
- Hey, you interested in a nice coat?
- It never looked good on me anyway.

668
01:07:41,300 --> 01:07:44,200
You gotta get me up
to the pilots' briefing room.

669
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:47,700
I gotta hear what they're saying.
Which map gets me in there?

670
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,100
- Don't touch it.
- Find the map.

671
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:53,400
I'll find it. You'll mess up
my whole damn filing system.

672
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:56,600
Pilots' briefing room,
I think that's in the main terminal.

673
01:07:56,800 --> 01:08:00,300
So would that be under P
for "pilots' briefing room"?

674
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:04,300
- Now, Marvin!
- Or maybe under M for "miscellaneous".

675
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:13,400
Request permission
to reduce sentry duty to 30-minute rotation.

676
01:08:13,700 --> 01:08:15,700
My men are getting cold and antsy. Over.

677
01:08:15,900 --> 01:08:21,000
This is Colonel Stuart. Have the men not
on watch assemble for a briefing. Over.

678
01:08:21,300 --> 01:08:23,500
What's the matter?

679
01:08:27,700 --> 01:08:30,100
Gentlemen, tonight the pattern ends.

680
01:08:30,300 --> 01:08:34,400
The dominoes will fall no more
and the ramparts will remain upright.

681
01:08:34,700 --> 01:08:38,300
Sir, General Esperanza's plane
just came on the scope.

682
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:48,200
Attention, Dulles tower.
We will be lighting up a runway.

683
01:08:48,400 --> 01:08:51,800
Do not, repeat,
do not attempt to land any planes.

684
01:08:52,500 --> 01:08:54,900
Remember, we're monitoring you.

685
01:08:57,900 --> 01:09:01,400
- What do we do?
- Obey.

686
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:13,000
Dulles tower to Foxtrot Michael One.

687
01:09:13,300 --> 01:09:16,500
This is Foxtrot Michael One, Dulles.
We read you. Over.

688
01:09:17,100 --> 01:09:22,300
Foxtrot Michael One, you are
to come in on runway 1-5.

689
01:09:36,400 --> 01:09:40,000
I found it on the floor, by the coat,
next to the luggage belt.

690
01:09:40,300 --> 01:09:42,900
What the hell you so excited for?

691
01:09:43,100 --> 01:09:46,200
- The code's still punched into this one.
- You like it.

692
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:49,200
How about you give me 20 bucks for it?

693
01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:54,000
- How about I let you live?
- The man knows how to bargain.

694
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:57,000
This is contrary to our instructions.

695
01:09:57,200 --> 01:09:59,500
We are to land at runway 1-0,

696
01:09:59,700 --> 01:10:03,400
where we are to be met
by representatives of your Justice...

697
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:08,000
Captain, please tell the tower
you will proceed as ordered.

698
01:10:19,400 --> 01:10:23,800
Roger, Dulles. Proceeding to runway 1-5.

699
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:42,500
Foxtrot Michael One. Come in, please.

700
01:10:43,500 --> 01:10:47,800
What are you gonna do now? Are you gonna
shoot me? So who will fly the plane?

701
01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:51,200
Don't worry about it. It's not your problem.

702
01:10:57,900 --> 01:10:59,400
Michael One. Do you copy?

703
01:11:03,900 --> 01:11:05,800
Foxtrot Michael One, come in.

704
01:11:15,500 --> 01:11:17,500
Eagle Nest. This is Falcon. Mayday.

705
01:11:23,100 --> 01:11:27,500
- Go ahead, Falcon.
- I've lost cabin pressure. Near-zero visibility.

706
01:11:28,300 --> 01:11:32,600
I must drop out of this weather and land
now, on the first accessible runway.

707
01:11:32,900 --> 01:11:37,100
Repeat. I've lost cabin pressure.
Near-zero visibility.

708
01:11:37,400 --> 01:11:39,300
I must drop out of the storm.

709
01:11:39,500 --> 01:11:43,500
I can land, but I must land now,
on the first outgoing runway.

710
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:47,300
Repeat. I cannot circle around to runway 1-5.

711
01:11:51,700 --> 01:11:56,700
I'll make you a deal. Show me out to those
runways and I'll get you a liner for that coat.

712
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:00,100
Repeat. I cannot circle around to runway 1-5.

713
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:01,700
Shit!

714
01:12:01,900 --> 01:12:03,900
Stand by, Falcon.

715
01:12:05,200 --> 01:12:07,100
He's coming in from the ocean, sir.

716
01:12:09,900 --> 01:12:12,300
A bullet damaged my instruments.

717
01:12:12,500 --> 01:12:16,200
I'm not sure of my bearings and I must
make a visual landing immediately.

718
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:19,300
- Do you copy, Eagle Nest?
- Roger, Falcon.

719
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:23,800
That would be 2-5 right.

720
01:12:24,100 --> 01:12:26,100
Make up your fucking mind.

721
01:12:27,100 --> 01:12:29,700
We are just up to our ass
in terrorists again, John.

722
01:12:30,200 --> 01:12:32,300
2-5 left.

723
01:12:32,500 --> 01:12:35,200
2-5 right.

724
01:12:35,700 --> 01:12:38,000
I gotta quit smoking cigarettes.

725
01:12:38,200 --> 01:12:40,700
Thank you for telling me, Eagle Nest.

726
01:12:40,900 --> 01:12:44,000
But if you could show it to me as well,
I would be grateful.

727
01:12:55,400 --> 01:12:58,200
I see the lights.
They are directly in front of me.

728
01:13:00,100 --> 01:13:02,900
Reducing airspeed. Approaching runway.

729
01:13:03,100 --> 01:13:05,600
- Wish me luck.
- Roger, Falcon.

730
01:13:07,700 --> 01:13:09,700
We copy. We'll have you in five minutes.

731
01:13:10,300 --> 01:13:13,400
That's right, asshole.
We'll have you in five minutes.

732
01:13:37,400 --> 01:13:40,000
I see your lights. ETA 90 seconds.

733
01:13:49,500 --> 01:13:51,500
Come to papa, scumbag.

734
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:49,400
Shit!

735
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:51,100
Freedom.

736
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:53,200
Not yet.

737
01:15:54,900 --> 01:15:58,200
You should stay in your seat until
the plane reaches the terminal.

738
01:15:58,500 --> 01:16:00,500
No frequent-flier mileage for you.

739
01:16:00,700 --> 01:16:02,500
- Who are you?
- A cop.

740
01:16:02,700 --> 01:16:04,800
- A cop?
- Yeah, one of the good guys.

741
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:09,100
And you're a bad guy. Now I've got your
sorry ass, I'm gonna trade it for my wife.

742
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:20,800
Sit down!

743
01:16:31,100 --> 01:16:33,600
- Where'd he go?
- In there.

744
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:47,700
Two months of planning, and
you can't anticipate one pendejo of a cop.

745
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:51,000
- Come on, General.
- Where is Colonel Stuart?

746
01:16:54,600 --> 01:16:56,800
- General!
- I'm all right.

747
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:00,300
He said he was a policeman.
I thought you had this place secured.

748
01:17:00,700 --> 01:17:03,900
- He went in the cockpit.
- He's going to hell.

749
01:17:07,400 --> 01:17:09,300
I assume it's you, McClane.

750
01:17:10,100 --> 01:17:12,800
You're quite a little soldier.

751
01:17:13,100 --> 01:17:16,200
You can consider this a military funeral!

752
01:17:40,900 --> 01:17:43,700
- How many grenades we got?
- Three each!

753
01:17:44,100 --> 01:17:45,800
Use 'em!

754
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:57,200
Fuck.

755
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:12,900
Go!

756
01:18:40,600 --> 01:18:42,600
You lucky fuck.

757
01:18:45,300 --> 01:18:49,100
- Fire trucks, sir.
- Fall back to the church. Now!

758
01:19:11,400 --> 01:19:13,600
Where's the fuckin' door?

759
01:19:28,500 --> 01:19:31,900
They're getting a little nervous back there.
In fact, so am I.

760
01:19:32,200 --> 01:19:35,900
We're over Washington. See if you
can get any TV to settle 'em down.

761
01:19:36,100 --> 01:19:38,200
Works for me. I'll...

762
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:05,800
Writing your acceptance speech
for the video sleaze awards?

763
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,700
- Try Pulitzer.
- While waiting to land,

764
01:20:08,900 --> 01:20:13,100
we are turning on local Washington TV.
The sound is on channel three.

765
01:20:32,200 --> 01:20:35,900
Please, sir, we may land at any moment.
If you'll take your seat...

766
01:20:36,200 --> 01:20:39,400
- I'm gonna be sick.
- Sir, the seat-belt light is on.

767
01:20:44,700 --> 01:20:45,800
Moron.

768
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,200
- WZDC.
- This is Richard Thornberg.

769
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:51,000
- Put me through to Ruben.
- He's about to go live.

770
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:54,600
- I know he is. That's why I need him.
- You'll have to hold on...

771
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:57,600
Put me through, Celia,
or start typing your résumé.

772
01:20:59,100 --> 01:21:02,600
Esperanza's down... but he's hurt.

773
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:08,600
He took a round in his shoulder. I got one
more of their guys. That's six they lost.

774
01:21:08,900 --> 01:21:11,700
If we knew how many they had,
we could get excited,

775
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:15,600
but if they got 50 guys,
it's a little early to open the champagne.

776
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:19,500
We appreciate your effort, but we
don't need a loose cannon here.

777
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:23,000
What if they crash another plane
in retaliation for your stunt?

778
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:25,400
They can't do that now, right, Barnes?

779
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:28,300
And if I'd grabbed Esperanza,
this'd be over now.

780
01:21:28,500 --> 01:21:32,800
- Maybe they're more creative than you think.
- At least I'm thinking, goddamn it.

781
01:21:33,100 --> 01:21:38,100
We're here to jerk off that cocksucker
until he tries to take off. Period!

782
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:42,300
You're the wrong guy
in the wrong place at the wrong time.

783
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:46,400
The story of my life.

784
01:21:47,200 --> 01:21:50,100
Major. Pentagon situation room, sir.

785
01:21:50,300 --> 01:21:53,100
Pentagon. I'll take it in here.
Thank you, Telford.

786
01:21:53,700 --> 01:21:56,100
You men come with me.

787
01:21:58,400 --> 01:22:00,100
- McClane.
- Yeah, Barnes.

788
01:22:00,200 --> 01:22:03,100
- You said those guys showed up right away?
- Yeah.

789
01:22:03,400 --> 01:22:06,300
So that must mean they're
on the field or close.

790
01:22:06,500 --> 01:22:10,000
I think I know where.
Come here, let me show you something.

791
01:22:12,500 --> 01:22:16,300
These are the old plans with the
longer runways. That's 12 years ago.

792
01:22:17,300 --> 01:22:21,400
Looks like they've modified the site,
moved Tra-Con phones, ILS,

793
01:22:21,700 --> 01:22:25,000
all the underground stuff,
so they could handle drainage.

794
01:22:25,300 --> 01:22:28,400
If I'm right, all of it would run
along the airport property

795
01:22:28,600 --> 01:22:31,700
and go right past this neighbourhood.

796
01:22:42,300 --> 01:22:45,200
Somebody ought to get their ass
kicked for this mess.

797
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:49,800
Unfortunately, there isn't anyone
we can blame for the weather.

798
01:22:50,100 --> 01:22:53,300
Yeah? What about that porker, Willard Scott?

799
01:22:53,500 --> 01:22:57,800
I should have taken the bus. At least
they can pull over for food and gas.

800
01:22:58,100 --> 01:23:00,700
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

801
01:23:01,500 --> 01:23:06,900
I was just wondering. This flight originally
was supposed to be five and a half hours.

802
01:23:08,200 --> 01:23:11,000
Do we have enough fuel to keep circling?

803
01:23:11,200 --> 01:23:14,900
Of course. They anticipate
little problems like this.

804
01:23:32,700 --> 01:23:35,500
We looked at 12 fucking houses,
and we're nowhere.

805
01:23:35,800 --> 01:23:38,100
This is our last possibility.

806
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:42,000
- Over here there's an old church.
- Let's go.

807
01:23:46,500 --> 01:23:48,500
Wait.

808
01:23:55,400 --> 01:23:57,300
There's the church over there.

809
01:24:05,300 --> 01:24:08,500
- Could be a sentry.
- He could just be out for a walk.

810
01:24:08,900 --> 01:24:11,900
Then why is he going over
his own footsteps?

811
01:24:14,100 --> 01:24:16,100
Come on.

812
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:20,900
All right. Just stay here
and get ready to call the marines.

813
01:24:21,200 --> 01:24:25,200
- I thought they were the army.
- Who gives a fuck? Just be ready.

814
01:24:42,300 --> 01:24:45,900
Shit. Not now.

815
01:25:00,400 --> 01:25:04,400
- Lorenzo, it's Barnes.
- Where the hell are you? Where's McClane?

816
01:25:04,700 --> 01:25:07,700
With me, at the community church,
to the west of the airport.

817
01:25:08,100 --> 01:25:11,000
Where? Goddamn it.
You crazy idiot, why didn't...

818
01:25:11,300 --> 01:25:14,500
This must be their operations base.
Shut up and get your ass here!

819
01:25:14,700 --> 01:25:16,900
Code red. Sit rep.

820
01:25:17,100 --> 01:25:20,000
We got positive ID on Stuart's location.
Let's move.

821
01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:36,000
Our escape plane will be ready
within 30 minutes, General.

822
01:25:37,200 --> 01:25:39,200
If there are no more surprises.

823
01:25:54,200 --> 01:25:56,500
Gentlemen, we have a situation here.

824
01:27:14,700 --> 01:27:16,800
They're over here.

825
01:27:28,700 --> 01:27:31,000
Jeez, you all right? You want a medic?

826
01:27:31,200 --> 01:27:34,200
What the hell you think you're doin'?
Playing John Wayne?

827
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:36,500
How'd you like to spend the night in a cell?

828
01:27:36,700 --> 01:27:40,100
Shut the fuck up and do
something useful. Seal off the street.

829
01:27:40,400 --> 01:27:43,700
- Hey, you can't talk to me like that.
- No, Carmine?

830
01:27:43,900 --> 01:27:47,400
Sergeant, get this bureaucrat
out of Mr McClane's face - now!

831
01:27:47,800 --> 01:27:50,200
With pleasure, sir.

832
01:27:52,100 --> 01:27:55,200
Major, the men are in position, sir.

833
01:27:55,400 --> 01:27:58,300
Close up the back, then we go in.
Fire only on my order.

834
01:27:58,500 --> 01:28:00,100
Roger that, sir.

835
01:28:00,300 --> 01:28:04,200
Guess I was wrong about you.
You're not such an asshole after all.

836
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:07,800
No, you were right.
I'm just your kind of asshole.

837
01:28:17,400 --> 01:28:19,600
Garber, sit rep!

838
01:28:19,800 --> 01:28:22,900
Army Special Forces
on three sides, closing in fast!

839
01:28:23,100 --> 01:28:26,300
- Another problem, Colonel?
- No problem, General.

840
01:28:26,900 --> 01:28:29,600
Gentlemen, you know what to do.

841
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:42,600
- Down!
- Get down!

842
01:29:11,300 --> 01:29:13,700
General... it's time.

843
01:29:21,200 --> 01:29:23,600
Come on, let's move it.

844
01:29:37,800 --> 01:29:40,600
- They're pulling out... at the back.
- What?

845
01:29:48,900 --> 01:29:50,800
Move it!

846
01:30:00,200 --> 01:30:02,500
Albertson, your men around the back.

847
01:30:28,600 --> 01:30:30,600
This equipment could land our planes.

848
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:34,300
- Don't touch anything. If it's booby-trapped...
- It is.

849
01:30:34,500 --> 01:30:37,700
Got one here. Looks like C-4.
The motherfucker is armed.

850
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,700
Clear the area. Everybody, now!

851
01:30:44,100 --> 01:30:46,700
They booby-trapped the equipment.
Seal it off.

852
01:30:46,900 --> 01:30:48,900
Shit!

853
01:30:51,700 --> 01:30:53,600
Where the fuck is McClane?

854
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,300
Miller, take him.

855
01:31:46,500 --> 01:31:48,600
I'll cover you.

856
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:37,600
So much for the element of chance.

857
01:32:38,300 --> 01:32:40,300
Let's move out.

858
01:32:57,400 --> 01:32:59,900
I had the bastard in my sights. I know I did.

859
01:33:11,100 --> 01:33:13,300
Jesus Christ.

860
01:33:17,600 --> 01:33:20,400
Attention, Dulles tower.

861
01:33:20,600 --> 01:33:23,300
This is Colonel Stuart. Is our plane prepared?

862
01:33:23,600 --> 01:33:27,000
It is. It's in hangar 11.
It's the most remote building we've got.

863
01:33:28,700 --> 01:33:34,200
We're on our way. Have a ground crew there
to confirm the condition of the plane.

864
01:33:34,500 --> 01:33:37,400
Do you believe the balls
on this son of a bitch?

865
01:33:37,600 --> 01:33:40,400
Colonel, you're capable
of confirming it yourself.

866
01:33:40,700 --> 01:33:43,900
Don't ask us to gift-wrap
potential hostages for you.

867
01:33:44,100 --> 01:33:47,200
- Major Grant, isn't it?
- If you remember me, Colonel,

868
01:33:47,400 --> 01:33:50,500
then you remember
I know the drill as well as you do.

869
01:33:51,100 --> 01:33:53,600
Check out your own fuckin' plane.

870
01:33:53,800 --> 01:33:57,600
We move out in five minutes.
Flakjackets for everybody.

871
01:33:57,900 --> 01:34:01,800
Body armour for the assault team.
Night scopes for the snipers.

872
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:07,500
We go to the hangar. I will pull that detonator
out of Stuart's dead fuckin' hand myself.

873
01:34:08,900 --> 01:34:11,400
Lorenzo, take all your men back to the airport.

874
01:34:11,600 --> 01:34:16,100
Seal off every exit in case they try to slip
past us to break out onto the ground.

875
01:34:16,600 --> 01:34:18,800
You got it.

876
01:34:20,200 --> 01:34:22,500
All right, here we go.

877
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:27,400
This is nuts! Every station has people at the
airport. No one has heard a whisper of this!

878
01:34:27,700 --> 01:34:31,100
None of them is me. You want proof, try this.

879
01:34:31,800 --> 01:34:34,400
Terrorists have murdered civilians

880
01:34:34,600 --> 01:34:37,500
and cut off the two systems
that allow you to land.

881
01:34:37,700 --> 01:34:41,100
A Special US army unit is here,
preparing to take out the terrorists.

882
01:34:41,400 --> 01:34:44,100
- Jesus Christ.
- I want you to go live now.

883
01:34:44,300 --> 01:34:47,900
Key me in from the files, a publicity shot.
Steal a map from weather.

884
01:34:48,100 --> 01:34:51,000
We're on it. We're cutting in five minutes.

885
01:34:51,300 --> 01:34:55,800
Tell the affiliates, if they want in, they got
three minutes to shout. Let's do this.

886
01:34:56,400 --> 01:34:57,800
Network, here I come.

887
01:35:01,100 --> 01:35:06,000
Telford, what was your chickenshit outfit
doing while we were taking Grenada?

888
01:35:08,100 --> 01:35:13,100
Grenada. Five minutes of firefight,
five weeks of surfing.

889
01:35:13,400 --> 01:35:17,400
- I wish I was with you guys for that.
- Yeah. Me too, kid.

890
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
- Really, sir?
- Sure.

891
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:23,700
Then we wouldn't have to do this.

892
01:35:38,900 --> 01:35:40,900
Eagle Nest, this is Hatchling.

893
01:35:42,200 --> 01:35:44,900
On schedule... and in position.

894
01:35:45,300 --> 01:35:47,200
Roger, Hatchling. We are secure here.

895
01:35:47,900 --> 01:35:52,200
You have a green light.

896
01:36:03,800 --> 01:36:07,000
Jesus, officer, where'd
you come from, Pearl Harbor?

897
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:15,300
Let's clear it out, please.

898
01:36:18,700 --> 01:36:20,900
Five, four, three...

899
01:36:21,700 --> 01:36:24,500
This is a special bulletin
from WZDC News.

900
01:36:24,700 --> 01:36:28,900
There has been a plane crash at Dulles,
where other aircraft still circle,

901
01:36:29,200 --> 01:36:32,200
with no explanation
from airport or FAA officials.

902
01:36:32,400 --> 01:36:35,200
And now, with an exclusive WZDC report,

903
01:36:35,400 --> 01:36:39,200
here's Dick Thornberg reporting
from the skies over Washington.

904
01:36:39,500 --> 01:36:42,800
I'm one of the people circling our capital

905
01:36:43,100 --> 01:36:47,600
under the assumption that whatever
problem there was below was a normal one.

906
01:36:48,100 --> 01:36:51,900
But the truth is far from normal.
The truth is terrifying.

907
01:37:00,900 --> 01:37:02,900
Get out of the way, lady!

908
01:37:05,100 --> 01:37:10,900
This is a recording of a conversation between
Dulles tower and a captive aircraft overhead.

909
01:37:16,400 --> 01:37:19,300
- Lorenzo!
- Are you out of your fuckin' mind?

910
01:37:19,500 --> 01:37:23,200
- Where's the Blue Light team?
- Stuart's rigged explosives to a remote.

911
01:37:23,500 --> 01:37:26,500
- Where's Grant?
- His boys are gonna kill that son of a bitch.

912
01:37:26,700 --> 01:37:30,200
- No, they're gonna take off with him.
- Get the fuck outta here.

913
01:37:30,500 --> 01:37:33,300
When the army canned Stuart,
he put his men in that unit.

914
01:37:33,500 --> 01:37:37,200
- Are you nuts? That firefight...
- Sideshow to buy him some time.

915
01:37:37,500 --> 01:37:42,200
You are completely around the fuckin' bend.
You're under arrest, motherfucker.

916
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:53,400
These are the bullets they
used out there tonight. Blanks!

917
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
Jesus Christ.

918
01:38:05,600 --> 01:38:08,900
This is Chief Lorenzo.
I want every officer recalled

919
01:38:09,200 --> 01:38:13,000
and in body armour and full weaponry
in the motor pool in five minutes.

920
01:38:15,800 --> 01:38:18,100
It's time to kick ass.

921
01:38:19,900 --> 01:38:22,100
Just like lwo Jima.

922
01:38:22,300 --> 01:38:28,000
We have learned that
the terrorists have control of the airport,

923
01:38:28,400 --> 01:38:30,800
a fact that the authorities have repressed.

924
01:38:31,300 --> 01:38:35,000
The terrorists promise more bloodshed
unless their demands are met.

925
01:38:35,300 --> 01:38:38,600
Now that the Special army commandos
have arrived at the airport,

926
01:38:38,800 --> 01:38:43,200
the likelihood of a full-scale
battle is dangerously close.

927
01:39:04,800 --> 01:39:09,600
That stupid, arrogant son of a bitch.
It's all over the airport.

928
01:39:10,600 --> 01:39:12,600
300 people have died

929
01:39:14,900 --> 01:39:17,500
and, unfortunately, they may not be the last.

930
01:39:17,700 --> 01:39:20,900
The horrifying fact is that no one is safe,

931
01:39:21,100 --> 01:39:24,600
either in the planes above Dulles
or in the terminal below.

932
01:39:24,900 --> 01:39:29,800
The threat of a higher body count at the
airport hangs over the heads of everyone,

933
01:39:30,100 --> 01:39:33,800
and the holiday season of peace
and love has become a nightmare.

934
01:39:40,700 --> 01:39:46,300
Listen up, all units. I want
you to converge on hangar 11, all sides.

935
01:39:46,700 --> 01:39:48,700
This car, McClane. Get in!

936
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:54,500
When the city blue show up with their
backup, they'll pick up the pieces. Move out!

937
01:39:55,800 --> 01:40:00,300
- McClane, say hi to my brother Vito.
- Merry Christmas.

938
01:40:01,300 --> 01:40:03,200
Hi.

939
01:40:08,400 --> 01:40:12,400
Goddamn it to hell! Move that piece of shit.

940
01:40:14,200 --> 01:40:16,800
Will you move that goddamn
piece of shit out of here?

941
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:22,400
Vito, get the fuck out of the car
and get your ass in gear and help me!

942
01:40:26,700 --> 01:40:29,400
Hey, Coleman!

943
01:40:33,900 --> 01:40:36,300
- Hey, Coleman!
- Hi.

944
01:40:39,100 --> 01:40:42,800
...but at least the truth
is not among the hostages

945
01:40:43,100 --> 01:40:47,500
because I, Richard Thornberg,
just happened to be here

946
01:40:47,800 --> 01:40:54,100
to put his life and talent
on the line for humanity and country.

947
01:40:54,500 --> 01:40:56,600
If this should be my final broadcast...

948
01:40:59,400 --> 01:41:01,800
Amen to that, Dick.

949
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:06,800
Dick? We're live, Dick. Where are you now?

950
01:41:10,800 --> 01:41:14,500
Truck lights approaching, sir.
They're here, right on schedule.

951
01:41:15,600 --> 01:41:17,600
The hangar door, open it.

952
01:41:18,200 --> 01:41:20,200
Clockwork.

953
01:41:42,700 --> 01:41:45,600
Jeez, you give me this story,
and I'll have your baby.

954
01:41:46,700 --> 01:41:48,700
Not the kind of ride I'm looking for.

955
01:42:00,800 --> 01:42:03,700
Colonel, if I may say so,
you are some piece of work.

956
01:42:03,900 --> 01:42:07,300
Thank you, Major. You're not so bad yourself.

957
01:42:07,600 --> 01:42:10,600
- Congratulations on your escape, sir.
- Thank you, Major.

958
01:42:10,800 --> 01:42:13,800
- You should save them until we are all safe.
- Sir.

959
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:18,100
My congratulations, gentlemen.
You've won a victory for our way of life,

960
01:42:18,400 --> 01:42:22,000
my pride, my admiration,
and a kick-ass vacation.

961
01:42:22,400 --> 01:42:24,400
Now, get on board.

962
01:42:54,500 --> 01:42:57,000
- Ride too rough, cowboy?
- I don't like to fly.

963
01:42:57,200 --> 01:42:59,500
- So why are you here?
- I don't like to lose.

964
01:43:11,800 --> 01:43:15,600
I don't know about you, but I've seen
enough snow to last me a lifetime.

965
01:43:15,900 --> 01:43:21,100
- You don't get much of that in the tropics.
- For you gentlemen, we'll import it.

966
01:43:23,400 --> 01:43:25,700
Shit. They left the hangar.

967
01:43:28,900 --> 01:43:30,900
Right there. Get that.

968
01:43:31,200 --> 01:43:33,200
- Now what?
- Get in front.

969
01:43:33,400 --> 01:43:35,400
Block their path so they can't get out.

970
01:43:35,600 --> 01:43:39,400
I'm not playing chicken with a 200-ton plane!
I'm crazy, but not that crazy.

971
01:43:39,600 --> 01:43:43,400
- Dulles, this is Northeast 140.
- That's Holly's plane.

972
01:43:43,700 --> 01:43:46,000
Request emergency clearance.

973
01:43:46,200 --> 01:43:48,500
I know you won't answer but you better listen.

974
01:43:48,700 --> 01:43:53,500
We're down to fumes and we have to land.
In five minutes, we're coming in.

975
01:43:53,800 --> 01:43:58,800
- That's my wife's plane. Take it fuckin' down!
- I'm not getting in front of that plane.

976
01:44:03,400 --> 01:44:05,300
How about gettin' over top of it?

977
01:44:05,800 --> 01:44:08,100
This is the captain. Your attention.

978
01:44:08,300 --> 01:44:11,500
We have no choice
but to attempt an emergency landing.

979
01:44:11,800 --> 01:44:14,800
Fasten your seat belts
and assume crash positions,

980
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:19,300
- as instructed by your cabin attendants.
- Let's have the emergency check list.

981
01:44:19,600 --> 01:44:23,400
Attention, all air traffic in Dulles area.
This is Northeast 140.

982
01:44:23,600 --> 01:44:26,100
We are attempting an emergency landing.

983
01:44:31,400 --> 01:44:33,600
I don't wanna die.

984
01:44:34,200 --> 01:44:36,100
I'm sorry.

985
01:44:39,100 --> 01:44:41,100
God!

986
01:44:50,100 --> 01:44:52,500
Thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.

987
01:44:59,500 --> 01:45:02,300
- Hang on!
- What are you doing?

988
01:45:02,500 --> 01:45:07,300
You wanted a story.
Nice and easy, boys. Get me in low.

989
01:45:11,200 --> 01:45:15,400
- Bring me down.
- You'll get yourself killed.

990
01:45:22,300 --> 01:45:24,800
Bring it in low. Keep over the wing.

991
01:45:32,700 --> 01:45:34,700
Lower.

992
01:45:43,500 --> 01:45:46,900
John, what the fuck are you doin'
out on the wing of this plane?

993
01:45:54,900 --> 01:45:56,500
Damn!

994
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:05,400
There's something wrong.

995
01:46:05,600 --> 01:46:08,000
The ailerons. We can't take off.

996
01:46:14,300 --> 01:46:16,400
It's McClane again.

997
01:46:16,600 --> 01:46:18,800
Son of a bitch!

998
01:46:20,100 --> 01:46:23,200
- I'll do him.
- This time, do it right.

999
01:46:23,500 --> 01:46:26,700
Just get us in the air, General.
You're the only man who can do it.

1000
01:46:26,900 --> 01:46:30,200
Don't shoot. That wing is fully fuelled.

1001
01:47:21,500 --> 01:47:24,100
Too bad, McClane. I kinda liked you.

1002
01:47:32,300 --> 01:47:34,300
I got enough friends.

1003
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:15,200
Time for the main event.

1004
01:48:50,300 --> 01:48:52,300
You motherfucker!

1005
01:49:04,100 --> 01:49:06,100
How's it goin'?

1006
01:49:17,700 --> 01:49:20,000
Happy landings, asshole!

1007
01:50:11,200 --> 01:50:13,100
Yippee-ki-yay, motherfucker.

1008
01:51:05,100 --> 01:51:07,200
Holly!

1009
01:51:07,500 --> 01:51:09,700
Here's your fuckin' landing light.

1010
01:51:22,100 --> 01:51:25,500
Look! I see it.

1011
01:51:51,400 --> 01:51:53,600
They used the fuckin' fire to see.

1012
01:51:53,800 --> 01:51:56,500
They can all do that. Let's tell 'em.

1013
01:51:56,700 --> 01:51:59,700
They already know. Listen.

1014
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:03,600
They're using the fire trail as a guide.
If they can do it, so can we.

1015
01:52:22,600 --> 01:52:25,200
Any landing you can walk
away from is a good one.

1016
01:53:37,300 --> 01:53:39,800
Holly!

1017
01:54:27,500 --> 01:54:29,800
Oh, God. Oh, baby.

1018
01:54:30,300 --> 01:54:34,500
- I thought I was never gonna see you again.
- That's what I thought about you.

1019
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:37,000
I love you so much.

1020
01:54:40,800 --> 01:54:43,600
They told me there were
terrorists at the airport.

1021
01:54:43,800 --> 01:54:46,500
Yeah. I heard that, too.

1022
01:54:54,400 --> 01:54:56,500
God, that's beautiful.

1023
01:54:59,600 --> 01:55:01,600
Yup. It sure is.

1024
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:05,900
I love you so much.

1025
01:55:08,300 --> 01:55:12,500
John, why does this keep happening to us?

1026
01:55:18,800 --> 01:55:20,500
Let's go home.

1027
01:55:25,300 --> 01:55:27,400
Somebody help me, please.

1028
01:55:27,800 --> 01:55:29,900
Honey, help me up here, please.

1029
01:55:30,100 --> 01:55:32,100
Asshole!

1030
01:55:34,700 --> 01:55:37,600
Hey, officer, come on!

1031
01:55:39,200 --> 01:55:42,000
Hop on in here. Get your missus in.

1032
01:55:42,200 --> 01:55:44,000
What do you say, Marv?

1033
01:55:44,200 --> 01:55:47,100
I'll be damned if
I'm gonna clean up this mess.

1034
01:55:57,600 --> 01:56:00,600
You get this parking ticket
in front of my airport?

1035
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:03,700
Yeah.

1036
01:56:04,300 --> 01:56:07,400
What the hell. It's Christmas.

1037
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:14,700
Take off, Marv!
