Description: Introduction
        =============
        
        PyCOM is simple and easy-to-use distributed component model written in Python.
        PyCOM makes different parts of your network application isolated and
        independent, while allowing easy and straightforward interaction between them.
        
        Highlights:
        
        - Non-intrusive design without black magic and lots of auto-generated code
        - Effective, easy-to-implement and portable protocol by default
        - Pluggable protocol support (default is JSON over ZeroMQ aka `zerojson`)
        - Support for binary attachments of any size
        - Support for stateful services via HTTP-alike sessions
        - Easily extensible core library
        - Low level enough to build your own frameworks
        - ... and still simple enough to be used as is
        - Python 2 and Python 3 support out-of-box
        - Comprehensive test suite and documentation
        - Free software (new BSD license)
        
        There is ongoing effort to create a C++ client library for PyCOM:

        Main concepts
        --------------
        
        With PyCOM you build your application as a number of *services*,
        each running in it's own process (or even on it's own computer).
        You maintain a PyCOM *nameserver* for finding services by their names
        (by the way, nameserver itself is a service).
        
        Services provide *interfaces*, i.e. a named way of interacting with service.
        They are somewhat similar to interfaces in e.g. Java, but note that
        PyCOM does not perform any checks on interfaces. Interface usually has
        some amount of *methods*.
        
        Services are identified by path with parts separated by slashes,
        e.g. ``/com/foo/group/service``.
        
        Interfaces are identified by name with parts separated by dots,
        e.g. ``com.foo.my-interface``.
        
        Examples
        ---------
        
        Service example (module ``service1.module1``)::
        
            import pycom
        
            @pycom.interface("com.foo.example")
            class Query(object):
        
                @pycom.method("create")
                def method_create(self, request):
                    return {"field1" : request.args}
        
            pycom.main()
        
        Example command line for running this service (provided nameserver is running
        on ``192.168.10.1:2012``)::
        
            python -m pycom -a tcp://192.168.10.2:2013 -n tcp://192.168.10.1:2012 service1.module1
        
        Example client code for this service::
        
            import pycom
        
            pycom.configure(nameserver="192.168.10.1:2012")
        
            query = pycom.locate("com.foo.example")
            print query.invoke("create", 42)
            # Prints {"field1" : 42}
        
        Quick start
        ------------
        
        To test (logs will be saved in `test.log`)::
        
            $ python test.py
        
        To build HTML documentation (requires `Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org>`_)::
        
            $ python setup.py build_sphinx
            $ <your-browser> build/sphinx/html/index.html
        
        To install::
        
            $ python setup.py install
        
        or via `pip`::
        
            $ pip install pycom
