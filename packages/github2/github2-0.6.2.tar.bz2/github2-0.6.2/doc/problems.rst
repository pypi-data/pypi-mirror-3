Request data
''''''''''''

With the ``DEBUG`` logging level enabled a message will be produced every time
an API request is made.

    >>> github = Github()
    >>> user = github.users.show("JNRowe")
    URL:[https://github.com/api/v2/json/user/show/JNRowe]
    POST_DATA:None
    RESPONSE_TEXT: [{"user":{"gravatar_id":"e40de1eb6e8a74cb96b3f07f3994f155","company":null,"name":"James Rowe","created_at":"2009/03/08 14:53:38 -0700","location":"Cambridge, UK","public_repo_count":41,"public_gist_count":64,"blog":"http://jnrowe.github.com/","following_count":5,"id":61381,"type":"User","permission":null,"followers_count":6,"login":"JNRowe","email":"jnrowe@gmail.com"}}]
    >>> user.gravatar_id
    u'e40de1eb6e8a74cb96b3f07f3994f155'

In the message you can see the URL that was accessed, here
``https://github.com/api/v2/json/user/show/JNRowe``.  You'll also see any HTTP
``post`` method data that was sent, in this case there was none.  And the full
response from GitHub, here the user data of ``JNRowe``.

Rate limiting
'''''''''''''

If rate limiting is enabled, with the ``requests_per_second`` parameter when
creating a :class:`~github2.client.Github` object, then you'll see a ``WARNING``
level message when a request has been delayed.

    >>> github = Github(requests_per_second=0.2)
    >>> user = github.users.show("JNRowe")
    >>> user = github.users.show("JNRowe")
    WARNING:github2.request:delaying API call 4.997032 second(s)

Here we have defined a rate limit of one call every five seconds, and doing so
has imposed an almost 5 second delay before completing the second request.
