Description: Plone Captchas
        ==============
        
        quintagroup.plonecaptchas is a simple captchas implementation for Plone, designed
        for validation of human input in insecure forms. This is a standalone 
        implementation which does not depend on captchas.net services.
        
        quintagroup.plonecaptchas adds captcha support to Plone, it works together with 
        quintagroup.captcha.core package (http://projects.quintagroup.com/products/wiki/quintagroup.captcha.core) and quintagroup.formlib.captcha (http://projects.quintagroup.com/products/wiki/quintagroup.formlib.captcha)
        
        With these products installed captchas will be added to Plone's 'Send this', 
        'Contact Us' (/contact-info) forms, and Plone's default discussion mechanism: 
        'Add Comment' and 'Reply' forms.
        
        quintagroup.plonecaptchas does not automatically plug to Plone's default registration
        (/@@register). You can make captcha plug to Plone's Register form via Zope Management Interface.
