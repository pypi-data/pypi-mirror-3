        =====
        
        A Javascript lexer in Python

        JsLex is part of an effort to improve Django's support of localized strings in
        Javascript code. It splits Javascript source into a list of tokens.
        
        This makes it more palatable by xgettext in C mode. 
        
        This is a release to PyPI created by Martijn Faassen to make it usable
        outside of Django as well.
        
        To run the tests, run "python tests.py".
