        Introduction
        ============
        This tool allows Plone managers to auto-discover and fix subject keywords,
        location and temporal coverage using http://www.alchemyapi.com/ web service.
        
        
        Main features
        =============
        
        - Auto-discover keywords, locations and temporal coverage
        
        
        Planed features
        ===============
        
        - Add a wizard icon near Subject, Location, etc fields in edit form
          to auto-discover and suggest tags based on text in
          other fields (Title, Description)
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        The easiest way to get eea.alchemy support in Plone 4 using this
        package is to work with installations based on `zc.buildout`_.
        Other types of installations should also be possible, but might turn out
        to be somewhat tricky.
        
        To get started you will simply need to add the package to your "eggs" and
        "zcml" sections, run buildout, restart your Plone instance and install the
        "eea.alchemy" package using the quick-installer or via the "Add-on
        Products" section in "Site Setup".
        
          .. _`zc.buildout`: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zc.buildout/
        
        You can download a sample buildout at:
        
          https://svn.eionet.europa.eu/repositories/Zope/trunk/eea.alchemy/buildouts
        
        
        Getting started
        ===============
        
        1. Get your alchemy key here: http://www.alchemyapi.com/api/register.html
        2. Update your alchemy API key within ZMI > Plone > portal_properties > alchemyapi
        3. Within Plone Control panel go to Alchemy Tags.
