Description: 
        PyFMI is a package for loading and interacting with Functional Mock-Up 
        Units (FMUs), which are compiled dynamic models compliant with the 
        Functional Mock-Up Interface (FMI), see 
        http://www.functional-mockup-interface.org/ for more information.
        
        FMI is a standard that enables tool independent exchange of dynamic 
        models on binary format. Several industrial simulation platforms 
        supports export of FMUs, including, Dymola, JModelica.org, OpenModelica 
        and SimulationX, see http://www.functional-mockup-interface.org/tools 
        for a complete list. PyFMI offers a Python interface for interacting 
        with FMUs and enables for example loading of FMU models, setting of 
        model parameters and evaluation of model equations.
        
        PyFMI is available as a stand-alone package or as part of the 
        JModelica.org distribution. Using PyFMI together with the Python 
        simulation package Assimulo adds industrial grade simulation 
        capabilities of FMUs to Python.
