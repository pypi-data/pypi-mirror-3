Description: ==============
        gocept.testing
        ==============
        
        This package collects various helpers for writing tests.
        
        
        assertEllipsis
        ==============
        
        An assertion which is very helpful when using Testbrowser with
        unittest.TestCase (instead of doctests).
        
        Some examples::
        
            self.assertEllipsis('...bar...', 'foo bar qux')
            # -> nothing happens
        
            self.assertEllipsis('foo', 'bar')
            # -> AssertionError: Differences (ndiff with -expected +actual):
                 - foo
                 + bar
        
            self.assertNotEllipsis('foo', 'foo')
            # -> AssertionError: "Value unexpectedly matches expression 'foo'."
        
        To use, inherit from ``gocept.testing.assertion.Ellipsis`` in addition to
        ``unittest.TestCase``.
        
        
        assertNothingRaised
        ===================
        
        The opposite of assertRaises(), this is an assertion that makes some tests more
        readable. As assertRaises(), it can be used as as context manager, too::
        
            self.assertNothingRaised(do_something, 1, 2, 3)
        
            with self.assertNothingRaised:
                do_something(1, 2, 3)
