Release
=======

Steps for releasing a new version of GeoAlchemy.

Check that version number is correct in ``setup.py`` and ``doc/conf.py``. If
not set it to the correct value, then commit to master, and push to GitHub.

Verify that the tests pass.

Create Git tag::

    $ git tag -a x.y -m 'version x.y'
    $ git push upstream x.y

Upload to PyPI:

    $ python setup.py release
