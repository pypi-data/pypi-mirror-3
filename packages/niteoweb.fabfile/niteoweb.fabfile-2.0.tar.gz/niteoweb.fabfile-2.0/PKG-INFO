Description: A bunch of Fabric commands we use all the time
        ==============================================
        
        This package contains a selection of Fabric command we use all the time. By
        sharing them online we hope to save someone some time researching how certain
        Plone-oriented tasks are performed with Fabric. Commands contain some hardcoded
        internal stuff, so they are not really usable out-of-the-box, more so as a
        point of reference. If there is interest, we'll rewrite them to be more
        reusable.
        
        List of commands available (see their docstrings for usage help):
        
        * configure_nginx
         
          - upload_configuration
          - enable_configuration
        
        * download_code
        
        * prepare_buildout
        
        * run_buildout
        
        * upload_data
        
          * upload_zodb
          * upload_blobs
        
        * download_data
          * download_zodb
          * download_blobs
        
        * start_supervisord
        
        * supervisorctl
        
        * upload_sphinx
