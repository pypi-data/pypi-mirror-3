- Image and file uploads through TinyMCE, and a browsable folder for
  media (ideas?).  (iElectric)

- A pluggable settings screen for content items for things like 'allow
  discussion', 'default page'.

- Content tagging.  See
  https://groups.google.com/d/topic/kotti/UynUSpwahPA/discussion

- Create add-ons kotti_disqus, kotti_feed (RSS), kotti_blog that make
  use of some of the features above.

- Allow in-page macros for things like 'table of contents' (for
  listing all contained pages in a TOC style).  See
  https://groups.google.com/d/msg/kotti/Kck0kYK3EkQ/YCu45JsJbI8J

- Add an item to the control panel that lists all application
  exceptions.  Possibly other introspectable features, like version
  numbers etc.

- Deprecate 'kotti.includes' in favour of 'pyramid.includes'.  See
  https://github.com/Pylons/Kotti/pull/44  (teixas)

- To allow for easier integration with 'repoze.workflow', add a
  'state' attribute to the Content class.  Write a cookbook entry for
  using 'repoze.workflow'.

- Move more navigation related functionality out of TemplateAPI and
  into snippets.
