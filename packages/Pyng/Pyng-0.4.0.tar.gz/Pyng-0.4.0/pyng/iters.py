    functions that might accept either: process either the single object I
    pass, or each item in this sequence.

    But the question has hidden subtleties. isinstance(obj, list) is obviously
    wrong -- what about tuples? Even isinstance(obj, (list, tuple)) isn't
    quite right. What about generators? What about 2.4 generator expressions?
    What about user-defined sequence classes?

    In exasperation we might simply write iter(obj). If it throws, obj is a
    scalar; otherwise it's a sequence. But that's not quite what we (usually)
    want either: you can iterate over the characters in a string...

    This function regards strings as scalars, but supports all other iterables
    as described above. Note that we test against basestring so that we notice
    either an ASCII string or a Unicode string.
