        What it is
        ==========
        
        It is a software for the (semiautomatic) analysis and filtering of
        force curves. Force curves are the output of an analytical technique
        called force spectroscopy. A force spectroscopy experiment usually
        requires the analysis of thousands of force curves at a time. As of
        today, there is no standard, free software for the analysis of force
        curves. Hooke aims to solve that.
        
        
        What it does
        ============
        
        * View, annotate, measure force curves
        * Worm-like chain and freely-jointed chain fit of force peaks
        * Automatic convolution-based filtering of empty curves
        * Automatic fit and measurement of multiple force peaks
        * Handles force-clamp force experiments (experimental)
        * It is extensible by users by mean of plugins and drivers

        Troubleshooting
        ===============
        
        If you have troubles in using it, before throwing it in the trash:
        
        1. Search the `issue tracker`_.
        2. Look at the `troubleshooting wiki page`_.
        3. Search the `discussion group`_.
        4. Ask a question in the discussion group.
        5. File a bug on the issue tracker.
        
        
        Disclaimer
        ==========
        
        Remember that Hooke is still experimental software! It has been mostly
        done to fit the needs of its authors, and there is no guarantee it
        will do what you need. However, you can write us/help us improve it so
        that it does. We aim to make of Hooke a robust tool that can help your
        research.
