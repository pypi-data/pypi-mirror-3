    This is the workhorse of file monitoring on the Windows platform.  It is a
    generator function which yields a ``(file_type, file_path, action)`` tuple
    whenever changes occur in the monitored folder.  ``file_type`` will be one
    of:
    
    * ``'file'``
    * ``'folder'``
    * ``'<deleted>'``

    ``file_path`` will be the path to the changed object; and ``action`` will
    be one of:

    * ``ACTION_CREATE``
    * ``ACTION_DELETE``
    * ``ACTION_UPDATE``
    * ``ACTION_RENAME_TO``
    * ``ACTION_RENAME_FROM``

    (The above are "constants" importable from ``edbob.filemon``.)

    This function leverages the ``ReadDirectoryChangesW()`` Windows API
    function.  This is nice because the OS now reports changes to us so that we
    needn't poll to find them.

    However ``ReadDirectoryChangesW()`` is a blocking call, so in practice this
    means that if, say, you're using this function in a python shell, you will
    not be able to stop the process with a keyboard interrupt.  (Actually you
    sort of can, as long as you send the interrupt and then perform some file
    operation which will trigger the monitoring function to return.)

    Fortunately the primary need for this function is by the Windows service,
    which is of course "disconnected" from the user's desktop and never really
    needs to close under normal circumstances.
