/helmholtz/preparations/templatetags/preparations.py - added a bunch of inclusion tags

added /helmholtz/recording/forms.py
/helmholtz/recording/models.py - removed "position" field from RecordingConfiguration model, added a whole bunch of fields to ProcotolRecording, for the sake of the Elphy interface - seems that most of these belong in the Stimulus model or a subclass thereof, added RecordingChannel model.
