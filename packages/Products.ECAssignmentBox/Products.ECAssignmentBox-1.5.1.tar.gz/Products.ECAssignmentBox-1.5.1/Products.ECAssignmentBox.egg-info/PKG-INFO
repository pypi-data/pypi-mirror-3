        Prerequisites
        =============
        
        To use ECAssignmentBox you need a current Plone installation, 
        specifically Plone 4.x.  Check `plone.org`_ for Plone's 
        prerequisites.

        Installation
        ============
        
        See the `Installing an Add-on Product`_ tutorial for more detailed 
        product installation instructions.

        Installing with buildout
        ------------------------
        
        If you are using `buildout`_ to manage your instance installing 
        ECAssignmentBox is very simple.  You can install it by adding it to the 
        eggs line for your instance::
        
          [instance]
          eggs =
              ... 
              Products.ECAssignmentBox
        
        After updating the configuration you need to run ``bin/buildout``, 
        which will take care of updating your system.
        
        Then restart your zope instance and use the Add/Remove products page
        in Site Setup to install ECAssignmentBox.
        
        .. _buildout: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zc.buildout
        
        Installing without buildout
        ---------------------------
        
        Move (or symlink) the ``ECAssignmentBox`` folder of this project
        (``Products.ECAssignmentBox/Products/ECAssignmentBox``) into the 
        ``Products`` directory of the Zope instance it has to be installed 
        for, and restart the server.  Use the Add/Remove products page in 
        Site Setup to install ECAssignmentBox.

        History
        =======
        
        # Changes in release 1.5.1 (2011-10-07)
        
        - ``Assignment Box Settings`` are back at Plone's control panel.
        
        - Minor bugfixes and improvements.
        
        
        # Changes in release 1.5 (2011-07-25)
        
        - Added compatibility for Plone 4.  Plone 3.x support has been dropped.
          Plone 3 users should use ECAssignmentBox 1.4.x.
        
        
        # Changes in release 1.4.3 (2011-04-29)
        
        - Minor improvements.
        
        
        # Changes in release 1.4.2 (2009-09-30)
        
        - ECAssignmentBox is now eggified and uploaded to PyPI.  An old-style 
          tarball distribution is still available at plone.org.
        
        - It's now possible to modify the submission period and other settings 
          for more than one assignment box at a time by using the ``set 
          assignment box options`` action on ECFolder's content tab.
        
        - Fixed issue: Assignments in state superseded can not be accessed by
          the owner.
        
        - Fixed issue: ECAssignmentBox int argument error.  After a students 
          submission is graded and state changed to Graded an ``TypeError: 
          int argument required`` appears on the statistics tab.
        
        
        # Changes in release 1.4 (2009-02-04)
        
        - ECAssignmentBox was completly re-implemented with support for Plone 
          3.x.
        
        
        # Changes in release 1.3 (2007-06-27)
        
        - ECFolders and assignment boxes now have an *analysis* tab which 
          provides more information about contained assignments, e.g., number
          of attempts users needed for an assignment or number of submissions 
          per day.
        
        - The *assignments (full)* view (shows the full text of all assignments
          on one page) is now integrated in the *assignments* tab.
        
        - New content type ECAssignmentTask, which can be used to build a
          repository of assignments; ECAssignmentTask objects can be
          referenced from ECAssignmentBoxes.
        
        - If an assignment box is located inside an ECLecture object which
          requires registration, submissions are only allowed for users
          enrolled in the course.
        
        
        # Changes in release 1.2 (2007-02-28)
        
        - Added field ``Maximum number of attempts`` to ECAssignmentBox to
          restrict the number of resubmissions.
        
        - Implemented issue #118: For box owners and managers it is now
          possible make submissions even if the assignment box is in state
          ``public draft`` or ``private``, and to make any number of
          resubmissions.
        
        - In the *assignments* view:
        
          - If there is more than one assignment box inside an ECFolder one
            will see a table for each box.  Clicking the check box in one of
            the tables' header will check or uncheck all entries inside this
            table only and *not* all entries in all tables.
        
          - Now it is possible to toggle the view of superseded assignments.
        
          - Added clickable workflow states (assignments can now be filtered
            by workflow state).
        
          - Added delete button and polished the ``change state`` controls.
        
        - As addition to the *assignments* view, owners and managers can use
          the *assignments (full)* tab to see the full text of all assignments
          on one page.
        
        - If the parent of an assignment box is an ECFolder and this ECFolder
          contains directions, the directions will be shown inside a
          collapsible box on top of the assignment box.
        
        - Fixed issue #119: Uploads can now be any size.
        
        - Fixed issue #120: Students do not see shared assignments of other
          users in the *statistics* view.
        
        - Performance improvements: We are now using portal_catalog where
          possible.
