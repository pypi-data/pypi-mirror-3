    Given a description of an oops config in the form of a dictionary
    this function will create the `oops.Config` to match.

    This allows you to have some flexibilty in your code about how
    exactly the oopses will be handled in different environments.
    Hooking this up to your config system means that you can
    change between oops delivery methods with a simple config change,
    rather than having to change the code to send oopses over AMQP
    rather than to a datedir, or putting the logic to decide what
    to do based on the configuration in your application code.

    Where the function doesn't allow for creating exactly what you
    need you can alter the returned `oops.Config` as desired.

    :param dict_config: a dict containing the description of the
        desired oops config. See the README for detailed information
        on what can be configured.
    :returns: an `oops.Config` object configured as specified.
