Description: ==================
        django-easyfilters
        ==================
        
        Overview
        ========
        
        This library provides filters similar in some ways to ``list_filter`` and
        ``date_hierarchy`` in Django's admin, but for use outside the
        admin. Importantly, it also includes result counts for the choices. It is
        designed to be very easy to get started with.
        
        Download/install
        ================
        Just install as a Python library.

        TODO
        ====
        
        * Possible: ability to specify 'defaults' attribute for FilterSet
        * Allow the automatic 'page' resetting to be customized

        Version 0.3
        -----------
        
        * Added the ``FilterSet.title`` attribute, and the ``title_fields`` attribute
          that can be used to control it.
        
        Version 0.2
        -----------
