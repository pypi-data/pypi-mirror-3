          a Python persistence framework for graph databases


What is Bulbs?

Bulbs is a Python persistence framework for graph databases that connects
to Rexster, a REST server optimized for recommendations. Rexster is part
of the TinkerPop stack. You can connect to any Blueprints-enabled graph
database, including Neo4j, OrientDB, Dex, OpenRDF Sail, and TinkerGraph.

Is it ready?

A preview release is out now, and I welecome feedback on how to improve it.
The API will probably change somewhat until we hit 1.0.

What do I need?

Rexster (https://github.com/tinkerpop/rexster) and a few Python libraries,
such as simplejson and httplib2.

Where are the docs?
