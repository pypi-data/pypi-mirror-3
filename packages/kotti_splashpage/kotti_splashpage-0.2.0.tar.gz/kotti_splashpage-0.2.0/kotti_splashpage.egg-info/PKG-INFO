        Description
        -----------
        
        `kotti_splashpage` is a kotti package to setup the home page as a splash page. It
        allows you to simply set a template in your application deployment
        configuration and have a splash page.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        easy_install, pip, setup.py install or whatever
        
        add `kotti_splashpage` to `pyramid.includes` and a template path to
        `kotti_splashpage.renderer` something like::
        
            pyramid.includes =
                ...
                kotti_splashpage
        
        And then add an override directory::
        
            kotti_splashpage.renderer = mypackage:templates/atemplate.pt
        
        NB: `kotti_splashpage.includeme` adds a populate function to set the site's default view. If you
        are adding several populate functions in `kotti.populators` be aware that you
        may need to manually include `kotti_splashpage.populate` to control order of the
        populators.
        
        Development
        -----------
