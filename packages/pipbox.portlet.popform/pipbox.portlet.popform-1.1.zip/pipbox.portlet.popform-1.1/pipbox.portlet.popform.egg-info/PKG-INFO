Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        `Popup Forms for Plone` is a Plone add-on that enables timed popups of
        `PloneFormGen`_ forms.
        
        Popup forms are configured as a portlet. When you add it, you specify
        a PloneFormGen form and the time delay (in 1/10th seconds). The form will
        then be shown as an AJAX popup form.
        
        When the popup is viewed, a cookie is set with a 1-year expiration, and the
        popup will not display again unless the cookie is absent. That prevents it
        from annoying more than once. Cookie support is also checked first, so
        the form will not be displayed if cookies aren't enabled. Again, the
        idea is to avoid annoying users.
        
        popform is a very small product that's mainly used to control a bit
        of `pipbox`_ functionality. If there are visual display or AJAX problems,
        please file a bug report against pipbox.

        Compatibility
        =============
        
        Popup Forms for Plone has been tested with Plone 3.  Support for Plone 4 is
        pending a PloneFormGen release that works in Plone 4.
        
        It requires Products.pipbox 3.0a8 or greater (which should get installed
        automatically as an egg dependency).
