Description: ===================
        treeio-achievements
        ===================
        
        treeio-achievements is a module for Tree.io (http://tree.io) that allows you to
        distribute Achievements among the users.
        It is completely integrated and even comes with a widget to dispay the last
        three Achievements that were given out.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Sadly, the installation is pretty complex. This assumes you already have
        Tree.io running.
        
         1. run ``pip install treeio-achievements``
         #. add ``achievements`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS``
         #. add the following line to your urls.py: 
         	``(r'^achievements/', include('achievements.urls')),``
         #. run ``python manage.py migrate achievements``
        	
        And that should do the trick.
        
        Have fun!
