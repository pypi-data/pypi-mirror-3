        Installing and Using Distribute

        About the fork
        ==============
        
        `Distribute` is a fork of the `Setuptools` project.
        
        Distribute is intended to replace Setuptools as the standard method
        for working with Python module distributions.
        
        The fork has two goals:
        
        - Providing a backward compatible version to replace Setuptools
          and make all distributions that depend on Setuptools work as
          before, but with less bugs and behaviorial issues.
        
          This work is done in the 0.6.x series.
        
          Starting with version 0.6.2, Distribute supports Python 3.
          Installing and using distribute for Python 3 code works exactly
          the same as for Python 2 code, but Distribute also helps you to support
          Python 2 and Python 3 from the same source code by letting you run 2to3
          on the code as a part of the build process, by setting the keyword parameter
          ``use_2to3`` to True. See http://packages.python.org/distribute for more 
          information.
        
        - Refactoring the code, and releasing it in several distributions.
          This work is being done in the 0.7.x series but not yet released.
        
        The roadmap is still evolving, and the page that is up-to-date is
        located at : `http://packages.python.org/distribute/roadmap`.
        
        If you install `Distribute` and want to switch back for any reason to
        `Setuptools`, get to the `Uninstallation instructions`_ section.
        
        More documentation
        ==================
        
        You can get more information in the Sphinx-based documentation, located
        at http://packages.python.org/distribute. This documentation includes the old 
        Setuptools documentation that is slowly replaced, and brand new content.
        
        About the installation process
        ==============================
        
        The `Distribute` installer modifies your installation by de-activating an
        existing installation of `Setuptools` in a bootstrap process. This process
        has been tested in various installation schemes and contexts but in case of a
        bug during this process your Python installation might be left in a broken
        state. Since all modified files and directories are copied before the
        installation starts, you will be able to get back to a normal state by reading
        the instructions in the `Uninstallation instructions`_ section.
        
        In any case, it is recommended to save you `site-packages` directory before
        you start the installation of `Distribute`.
        
        -------------------------
        Installation Instructions
        -------------------------
        
        Distribute is only released as a source distribution.
        
        It can be installed using easy_install or pip, and can be done so with the source
        tarball, the eggs distribution, or by using the ``distribute_setup.py`` script
        provided online.
        
        ``distribute_setup.py`` is the simplest and preferred way on all systems.
        
        distribute_setup.py
        ===================
        
        Download
        `distribute_setup.py <http://python-distribute.org/distribute_setup.py>`_
        and execute it, using the Python interpreter of your choice.
        
        If your shell has the ``curl`` program you can do::
        
            $ curl -O http://python-distribute.org/distribute_setup.py
            $ python distribute_setup.py
        
        Notice this file is also provided in the source release.
        
        easy_install or pip
        ===================
        
        Run easy_install or pip::
        
            $ easy_install -U distribute
            $ pip install distribute
        
        If you want to install the latest dev version, you can also run::
        
            $ easy_install -U distribute==dev
        
        This will get the latest development version at: http://bitbucket.org/tarek/distribute/get/0.6-maintenance.zip#egg=distribute-dev
        
        Source installation
        ===================
        
        Download the source tarball, uncompress it, then run the install command::
        
            $ curl -O http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/d/distribute/distribute-0.6.7.tar.gz
            $ tar -xzvf distribute-0.6.7.tar.gz
            $ cd distribute-0.6.7
            $ python setup.py install
        
        ---------------------------
        Uninstallation Instructions
        ---------------------------
        
        Like other distutils-based distributions, Distribute doesn't provide an
        uninstaller yet. It's all done manually! We are all waiting for PEP 376 
        support in Python.
        
        Distribute is installed in three steps:
        
        1. it gets out of the way an existing installation of Setuptools
        2. it installs a `fake` setuptools installation
        3. it installs distribute
        
        Distribute can be removed like this:
        
        - run ``easy_install -m Distribute``. This will remove the Distribute reference
          from ``easy-install.pth``. Otherwise, edit the file and remove it yourself.
        - remove the ``distribute*.egg`` file located in your site-packages directory
        - remove the ``setuptools.pth`` file located in you site-packages directory
        - remove the easy_install script located in you ``sys.prefix/bin`` directory
        - remove the ``setuptools*.egg`` directory located in your site-packages directory,
          if any.
        
        If you want to get back to setuptools:
        
        - reinstall setuptools using its instruction.
        
        Lastly:
        
        - remove the *.OLD.* directory located in your site-packages directory if any,
          **once you have checked everything was working correctly again**.
        
        -------------------------
        Quick help for developers
        -------------------------
        
        To use Distribute in your package, the recommended way is to ship
        `distribute_setup.py` alongside your `setup.py` script and call 
        it at the very begining of `setup.py` like this::
        
            from distribute_setup import use_setuptools
            use_setuptools()
        
        
        Another way is to add ``Distribute`` in the ``install_requires`` option::
        
            from setuptools import setup
        
            setup(...
                  install_requires=['distribute']
            )
        
        -----------
        Install FAQ
        -----------
        
        - **Why Distribute turn my Setuptools installation into an fake one?**
        
           Since Distribute is a fork, and since it provides the same package and modules,
           it fakes that the Setuptools installation is still present, so all the programs
           that where using Setuptools still work.
        
           If it wasn't doing it, a program that would try to install Setuptools
           would overwrite in turn Distribute.
        
        - **How does Distribute interacts with virtualenv?**
        
          Everytime you create a virtualenv it will install setuptools, so you need to
          re-install Distribute in it right after. The Distribute project will not
          attempt to patch virtualenv so it uses it when globally installed.
          We will just wait for virtualenv to eventually switch to Distribute.
        
          Once installed, your virtualenv will use Distribute transparently.
        
          Although, if you have Setuptools installed in your system-wide Python,
          and if the virtualenv you are in was generated without the `--no-site-packages`
          option, the Distribute installation will stop.
        
          You need in this case to build a virtualenv with the `--no-site-packages` 
          option or to install `Distribute` globally.
        
        - **How does Distribute interacts with zc.buildout?**
        
          You can use Distribute in your zc.buildout.  *The only thing* you need to do
          is use the bootstrap at `http://python-distribute.org/bootstrap.py`.  Run
          that bootstrap and ``bin/buildout`` (and all other buildout-generated
          scripts) will transparently use distribute instead of setuptools.  You do
          not need a specific buildout release.
        
          A shared eggs directory is no problem (since 0.6.6): the setuptools egg is
          left in place unmodified.  So other buildouts that do not yet use the new
          bootstrap continue to work just fine.  And there is no need to list
          ``distribute`` somewhere in your eggs: using the bootstrap is enough.
        
          The source code for the bootstrap script is located at
          `http://bitbucket.org/tarek/buildout-distribute`.

        -----
        0.6.7
        -----
        
        * Issue 58: Added --user support to the develop command
        * Issue 11: Generated scripts now wrap their call to the script entry point
          in the standard "if name == 'main'"
        * Added the 'DONT_PATCH_SETUPTOOLS' environment variable, so virtualenv
          can drive an installation that doesn't patch a global setuptools.
        * Reviewed unladen-swallow specific change from
          http://code.google.com/p/unladen-swallow/source/detail?spec=svn875&r=719
          and determined that it no longer applies. Distribute should work fine with
          Unladen Swallow 2009Q3.
        * Issue 21: Allow PackageIndex.open_url to gracefully handle all cases of a
          httplib.HTTPException instead of just InvalidURL and BadStatusLine.
        * Removed virtual-python.py from this distribution and updated documentation
          to point to the actively maintained virtualenv instead.
        * Issue 64: use_setuptools no longer rebuilds the distribute egg every
          time it is run
        * use_setuptools now properly respects the requested version
        * use_setuptools will no longer try to import a distribute egg for the
          wrong Python version
        * Issue 74: no_fake should be True by default.
        * Issue 72: avoid a bootstrapping issue with easy_install -U
        
        -----
        0.6.6
        -----
        
        * Unified the bootstrap file so it works on both py2.x and py3k without 2to3
          (patch by Holger Krekel)
        
        -----
        0.6.5
        -----
        
        * Issue 65: cli.exe and gui.exe are now generated at build time,
          depending on the platform in use.
        
        * Issue 67: Fixed doc typo (PEP 381/382)
        
        * Distribute no longer shadows setuptools if we require a 0.7-series
          setuptools.  And an error is raised when installing a 0.7 setuptools with
          distribute.
        
        * When run from within buildout, no attempt is made to modify an existing
          setuptools egg, whether in a shared egg directory or a system setuptools.
        
        * Fixed a hole in sandboxing allowing builtin file to write outside of
          the sandbox.
