Changes
=======

0.2.1 (24 Aug 2012)
-------------------

Added MANIFEST.in file; the distribution now includes the necessary CSS 
assets as well as the code's LICENSE file.

0.2 (20 Aug 2012)
-----------------

Fix compatibility with other plugins: previously, this plugin would
cause other plugins' add_stylesheet() calls to break, because of some
incompatibility with Genshi's cut()/buffer() commands.  This is now
fixed by avoiding calls to cut() and buffer()

0.1 (19 Aug 2012)
-----------------

Initial release
