SMTP Tester
===========

I spent a long time searching for a tool that would help me troubleshoot SMTP
problems quickly and easily without having to resort to telnet. Finally, I gave
up and wrote my own.

Features
--------

- Tested on OSX, Linux, and Windows
- Graphical (no more telnet)
- Trace window showing live progress from DNS record look-ups through SMTP
  session
- Ability to override all DNS and SMTP settings
- Support for SASL and TLS

Screenshots

Installation
------------

Install `wxPython <http://wxpython.org/download.php>`_ (preferably version 2.9, although success has been reported for 2.8 on some platforms)

::

  # pip install smtptester

...or:

::

  # easy_install smtptester

This should add an **smtptester** executable to your **$PATH**.
