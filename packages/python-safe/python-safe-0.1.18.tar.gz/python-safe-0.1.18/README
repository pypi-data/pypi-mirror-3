Installation
============

#. Install dependencies
   
   For Ubuntu::

    sudo apt-get install python-numpy python-gdal python-nose

   For Mac OSX::

    pip install numpy nose
    brew install gdal
    

#. Install this package::

    pip install python-safe

   If you do not have ``pip`` installed but only ``easy_install``,
   you can do ``easy_install pip`` and then use it to install ``python-safe``.

   To install a development version instead of the last release you can do::

    pip install -e git+https://ingenieroariel@github.com/AIFDR/python-safe.git#egg=python-safe

#. To verify everything is working as it should do, open a python shell and do::

    import safe
    safe.test()

   You can pass additional parameters to the test function, for example: ``verbose=2``
   to view the test names.
