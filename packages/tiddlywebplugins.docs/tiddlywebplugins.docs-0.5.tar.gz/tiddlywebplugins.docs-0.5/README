A serialization which provides documentation of the request methods
and serializations for all the resources available from the current
TiddlyWeb instance.

That is: for any existing resource if you get it as text/x-tiddlyweb-docs
this code will automatically generate documentation about this thing.

So, for example http://example.com/bags/foo/tiddlers.x-doc will
list the serializations and HTTP methods available at that URI.

The motivation for this is to cause lack-of-documentation shame.

Install by adding tiddlywebplugins.docs to system_plugins in
tiddlywebconfig.py.
