Description: = taskhelm =
        
        TaskHelm aims to be your primary tool for managing all of your tasks and
        projects.  It helps you stop feeling overwhelmed.
        
        It builds on top of the excellent TaskWarrior command line task manager
        by providing point-and-click interfaces for its functionality, and to
        add functionalities common in other graphical task management programs.
        We also look for novel new functionalities which enable you to better
        manage an overly full plate.
        
        
        Key Features:
        
          * Quickly set priority, wait, projects on multiple tasks.
        
          * Associate notes with a task.
        
          * Toggle buttons to filter tasks by priority.
        
          * Easily browse tasks by project.
        
          * Works concurrently with the task command line client.

        Make sure to set 'Target version' to 'taskhelm-1.0'.
        
        Patches to fix bugs, improve user documentation (in data/intial_tasks),
        and make the code more portable are extremely welcomed - post them to
        the bug tracker, or email them to me directly
        (bryce@bryceharrington.org).
        
        Feature patches are ok too, but check with me before getting too deep.
        
        
        == Acknowledgments ==
        
        Special thanks must be given to the Getting Things GNOME! project.  I've
        liberally borrowed design ideas and code snippets.  Taskhelm is not
        directly derived from GTG but if Taskhelm is successful, it's because it
        stands on GTG's shoulders.
        
        Much thanks also is due the Taskwarrior project; Taskhelm would not
        exist without their continued encouragement and support.
