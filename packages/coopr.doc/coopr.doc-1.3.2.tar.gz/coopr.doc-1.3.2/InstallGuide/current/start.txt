=== Importing Coopr Packages ===

The simplest way to get started with Coopr is to import the `coopr` package that you wish to work with.  For example, to use Pyomo, you would import `coopr.pyomo`:
[[shell]]
----
\$ python
Python 2.5 (r25:51908, Nov  8 2006, 07:49:04)
[GCC 3.4.2 20041017 (Red Hat 3.4.2-6.fc3)] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import coopr.pyomo
>>>

See link:https://software.sandia.gov/trac/coopr/wiki/Documentation[Getting Started with Coopr] for further 
discussion of how to use Coopr packages.

A variety of Python scripts are also included with Coopr.  If Coopr has been installed in the system Python installation, then these scripts should be available from the Python bin directory.  Otherwise, the user can add the `coopr/bin` directory to their PATH environment to enable the use of these scripts.


=== A Quick Test ===

As a quick test of your installation, you should be able to go to the following directory:

----
YOUR_COOPR_INSTALL_DIR\examples\pyomo\diet
----

And type:
[[shell]]
-----
pyomo diet1.py diet1.dat
-----
You should observe (unless you have the glpk solver installed on your system) the following error message:

-----
No executable found for solver 'glpk'
-----
While not solving problems, this does mean the install is working - just specify the "--solver=foo" option with the right "foo", and you'll be solving problems!
