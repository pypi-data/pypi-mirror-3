EazyText
========
Wiki, in general is a simple markup language to generate html pages
that can be rendered in a browser. This is quick and neat way of 
documentation. Eazytext can be used as a library package or as a command line
tool. It is lean, clean and insanely fast !! Since eazytext wiki-markup supports
dynamic text (text that gets translated based on context), it is not practical
to cache the html result and re-use them (by web-applications). And to avoid
parsing the wiki-text every-time, an intermediate .py file is generated.
You can learn more and hack into its guts at
`launchpad <https://launchpad.net/eazytext/trunk>`_.
