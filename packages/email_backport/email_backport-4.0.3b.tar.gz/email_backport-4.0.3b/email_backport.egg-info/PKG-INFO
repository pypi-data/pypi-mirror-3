Description: 5A5AThe email_backport package is a wrap-up of the email > 4.x module
        found in Python 2.5 and above.
        
        This is to create a simple way of creating email-related code that
        works with existing Python code and interpreters (>= Python 2.3) as
        there has been a lot of changes such as new naming standards, see
        here:
        
        http://docs.python.org/library/email
        
        To use in your code, try something like:
        
        EMAIL_4 = False
        import sys
        try:
        from email import message
        EMAIL_4 = True
        except ImportError:
        sys._IMPORTING_EMAIL_BACKPORT = True
        try:
        import email_backport as email
        sys.modules['email'] = email
        EMAIL_4 = True
        except ImportError:
        EMAIL_4 = False
        
        If EMAIL_4 is true, we're good to go, if not, one can disable mail
        features of the application.
        
        The versioning of email_backport follows Python's email module
        internal version.
