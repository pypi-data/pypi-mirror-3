Installation of colo plugin
---------------------------

To install the plugin, you need to put this directory under your Bazaar
plugins folder (usually ``~/.bazaar/plugins``).  An easy way to do that
is to use Bazaar to branch this project right into that directory::

  $ cd ~/.bazaar/plugins
  $ bzr branch lp:bzr-colo colo

The rest of the documentation is available by typing ``bzr help colo``
once the plugin is installed.

Dependencies
------------

The colo plugin depends on Bazaar version 2.1 or later.  If you have the 
qbzr plugin installed, it must be a version later than 0.18.1.
