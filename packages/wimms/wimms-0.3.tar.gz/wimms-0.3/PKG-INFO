        WIMMS
        =====
        
        **WIMMS** stands for *Where Is My Mozilla Service ?*.
        
        This library implements a SQL backend for a database that
        lists for a list of service, (user, node, service) tuples.
        
        It's used by Mozilla's Token Server.
        
        To see where WIMMS fits in the whole architecture, see:

        Tests
        -----
        
        To run the tests for mysql, you need to install a mysqlserver and export the 
        'WIMMS_MYSQLURI' variable properly. Something like this::
        
            $ export WIMMS_MYSQLURI="mysql://user:pass@host/db"
