Changes
=======

0.4
---

* Mostly PEP8 compliant.

0.3
---

* Should now compile on 32-bit and 64-bit platforms.
* Updated packaging and now uses SetupFixer.
* Added documentation based on the `original text`_ from Bram.

0.2
---

* The feature abbreviations now resemble the ones in the Intel and AMD 
  documentation.
* ``features()`` is now a function and returns a list of strings, instead of 
  being a comma separated string.
* Added some functions like ``vendor()`` and ``brand_string()`` as handy 
  wrappers.
* PyCPUID is now a combination of a pure python module ``pycpuid.py`` and an 
  extension ``_pycpuid.c``. The extension module is only responsible for the 
  actual ``cpuid`` call. All the fancy wrapper bits are implemented in Python.
* Added gcc support. Using ``__cpuid`` intrinsic on MSVC to support x64.

0.1
---

* Initial release.
