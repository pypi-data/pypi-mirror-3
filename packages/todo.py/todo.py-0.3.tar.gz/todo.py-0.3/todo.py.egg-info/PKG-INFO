            :alt: Build Status
        
        A port of the `popular todo.txt-cli project
        <https://github.com/ginatrapani/todo.txt-cli>`_ from bash to python.
        
        Dependencies
        ------------
        
        This only requires GitPython_ if you want to have todo.py also manage a git
        repository which tracks the related files. Running the script once will give
        you the URL to download it. Please note that GitPython is written for ``git
        --version`` 1.7.2+.
        
        If you're on Windows and running the script out of cmd.exe, install 
        colorama for 'termcolor' support.
        
        .. _GitPython: https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        From the repo
        `````````````
        If you want to install the copy locally (i.e. to a personal directory) you can
        simply download one of the packages_ and run the ``install.sh`` script.
        
        .. _packages: https://github.com/sigmavirus24/Todo.txt-python/downloads
        
        Be sure to run ``./install.sh -h`` first. You can decide where you would like
        the script installed (the default is ``$HOME/bin/``) and where you would like an
        alias for the script, e.g., ``t`` or ``tpy``, written (the default is
        ``$HOME/.bashrc``).
        
        Using pypi
        ``````````
        
        If you would prefer a system-wide installation, you can use install ``todo.py``
        from PyPi like so:
        
        ::
        
            $ pip install todo.py
        
        Be aware that making a system-wide installation will not automattically create
        an alias for your use. You will have to edit either your ``.bashrc`` or
        ``.bash_profile`` (or respective shell configuration filse) to include something
        along the lines of:
        
        ::
        
            alias t='$HOME/bin/todo.py'

        Enjoy, contribute, and feel free to clone. I'm doing this blind [1]_ as best as
        possible for fun.

        --------
        
        .. [1] By blind, I mean without looking at the source of the original todo.txt-cli
            project. I'm working solely from my experiences with the script and
            experimenting with the functionality while adding things I should probably write
            as patches and send upstream... I'll wait to finish my version of the project
            first though.
