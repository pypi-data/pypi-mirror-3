pypcapfile
==========

pypcapfile is a pure Python library for handling libpcap savefiles. 

The core functionality is implemented in pcapfile.savefile:

>>> from pcapfile import savefile
>>> sf = savefile.load_savefile('test.pcap', verbose=True)
[+] attempting to load test.pcap
[+] found valid header
[+] loaded 11 packets
[+] finished loading savefile.
>>> print sf
big-endian capture file version 2.4
snapshot length: 65535
linklayer type: LINKTYPE_ETHERNET
number of packets: 11
>>>

You can a look at the packets in sf.packets:
>>> pkt = sf.packets[0]
>>> p.raw()
<binary data snipped>
>>> p.timestamp
1343676707L
>>>

Future planned improvements:
* Packet parsing (i.e. IP(pkt) or TCP(pkt)
