Description: Dynamo: Simple DynamoDB API
        ===========================
        
        This module allows you to interact with DynamoDB much like a native Python dictionary.
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        ::
        
            import dynamo
        
            ACCESS_KEY = 'XXXXXX'
            SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = 'XXXXXX/XXXXXXXXX+XXXXXXX'
            TABLE_NAME = 'XXXXX'
        
            table = dynamo.table(TABLE_NAME, (ACCESS_KEY, SECRET_ACCESS_KEY))
        
            # Or, if you have AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY defined as
            # environment variables, you can do:
            table = dynamo.table(TABLE_NAME)
        
        Writing is simple::
        
            table['new-key']['attribute'] = ['value']
        
        So is reading::
        
            >>> table['existing-key']['attribute']
            'value'
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Installing dynamo is simple with pip:
        
        ::
        
            $ pip install dynamo
