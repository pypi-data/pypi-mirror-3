Buildout Versions
=================

This is a buildout extension that provides three functions:

- Output to the console of any versions not pinned in the buildout configuration

- The optional appending of any versions not pinned in the buildout configuration to a specified file.

- Make buildout agnostic of the casing used in distribution names.

For full documentation, please see http://packages.python.org/buildout-versions/use.html.

This package takes a lot of inspiration from `buildout.dumppickedversions`__.
