Description: winshell
        ========
        
        The winshell module is a light wrapper around the Windows shell functionality.
        
        It includes convenience functions for accessing special folders, for using
        the shell's file copy, rename & delete functionality, and a certain amount
        of support for structured storage.
        
        winshell is tested on all versions of Python from 2.4 to 3.2 (2.5+ for context
        management).
