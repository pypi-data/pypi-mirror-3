0.2.0 - 2012-02-14
==================

 * Added basic pattern-matching for the token_url, e.g. "/{app}/token".
 * Made TokenManager.make_token and TokenManager.parse_token accept the
   incoming request as first argument, mostly so they can get at the
   results of pattern-matching.
 * Let TokenManager.make_token return a dict of extra info to be included
   in the response.


0.1.0 - 2012-02-07
==================

 * Initial release.
