Description: 
        Flask-Compass
        =============
        
        Flask-Compass provides a simple integration of Compass_ into Flask applications
        especially to help during the development process.
        
        The extension scans the project's directory for Compass configuration files
        in order to compile the associated Compass project.
        
        
        Note that you need to have compass installed before being able to use this
        extension.
