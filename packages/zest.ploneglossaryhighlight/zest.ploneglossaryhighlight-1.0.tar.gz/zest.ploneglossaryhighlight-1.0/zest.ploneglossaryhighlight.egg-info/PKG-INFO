Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This is an extra package for `Products.PloneGlossary`_.  It adds a
        field ``highlight`` to Archetypes content types in your site.  With
        that field you can specify for a page whether terms on it should be
        highlighted.  Values can be yes, no, or use the value of the parent
        (which is the default).

        Installation
        ============
        
        - Add it to the eggs option of the zope instance in your buildout.
          Add it to the zcml option as well if you are on Plone 3.2 or lower
          (untested).
        
        - Restart your Zope instance.
        
        - Install it in the Add-ons control panel in Plone.
        
        
        Compatibility
        =============
        
        - Tested with Plone 3.3.5 and 4.1.2 (should be fine with earlier Plone
          3 or 4 versions too).
        
        - Requires Products.PloneGlossary 1.5.0 or later.
        
        
        Todo
        ====
        
        - I don't mind putting a dexterity behavior in here that offers the
          same functionatily for Dexterity content, as long as this does not
          mean dexterity becomes a dependency.
