``github2`` - GitHub API v2 library for Python
==============================================

.. warning::

   GitHub have marked API v2 as deprecated, you should be looking to replace
   your usage of ``github2`` in the near future.

   Both remoteobjects_ and micromodels_ provide easy-to-use functionality for
   creating bindings to remote APIs, and should significantly reduce the amount
   of work needed in moving away from GitHub's API v2.
