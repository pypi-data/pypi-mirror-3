django-bootup
================

A custom Django Bootup helps with repetitive tasks of running a clean project.

Current features:
1. Disables syncdb prompting the creation of a superuser
2. Latches on the post_syncdb signal and once syncdb is complete, it starts bootstrapping the site
3. It loads up any fixtures at a specified directory in your setting.py
    a. any valid fixture file will be loaded, with or without the initial_ prefix
    b. fixture directory is different than that of Django and set by: INITIAL_FIXTURES_DIRS
4. It creates a superuser with pk=1
    a. user credentials defined in private or local settings.py
5. It creates four sites, production, integration, localhost and a local_ip 
    a. site credentials defined in private or local settings.py
6. Auto create a user profile after each user creation

Usage
=====

If you want a worry free django bootup process, then this is for you.

Here what you need to do:
        
1. Stick ``"bootup"`` in ``INSTALLED_APPS``. After all other Django specific Apps
2. Create the following in your local_settings.py or private_settings.py or settings.py.

# superuser credentials
ADMIN_NAME = "your superuser name"
MAIN_PASS = "your superuser password?"
ADMIN_EMAIL = "your superuser email address"

# few sites you might need
SITE_INFO = {
    '1': {
        'name': 'production',
        'domain': "example.com"
    },
    '2':{
        'name': 'integration', # (optional)
        'domain': "example.net"
    },
    '3': {
        'name': 'localhost', # development on local system (optional)
        'domain': 'localhost:8080'
    },
    '4':{
        'name': 'internal', # development on local or remote system (headless vmware!) (optional)
        'domain': '192.168.224.128:8080'
    }   
}

# all valid fixture files in this directory will be loaded up regardless of whether they start with
# initial_ or not
INITIAL_FIXTURES_DIRS = "/some/real/path/to/your/fixtures"

If the following are set and a valid profile.UserProfile class in set:
AUTH_PROFILE_MODULE = True:
USER_PROFILE_AUTO_CREATE = 'profiles.Userprofile'
Then bootup will try to create the a profile for each user creation.
If the above are not set, or on errors, it will quietly skip creation of UserProfile.

That's it.
Run syncdb on an empty database and enjoy

Note: No action is taken on any of the above definitions unless they are found in settings.py
Also: Any existing user at pk=1 will be updated to superuser
      Any existing sites might be updated depending of pk of the site object

ToDo
=====
clean up readme
add auto UserProfile deletion when a User is deleted
Add test case for UserProfile Creation
add more goodies
