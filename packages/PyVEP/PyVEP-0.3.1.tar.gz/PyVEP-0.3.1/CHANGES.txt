0.3.1 - 2012-01-24
==================

  * Update the audience-extraction code in RemoteVerifier to support the
    new-style assertion format; thanks junkafarian.


0.3.0 - 2012-01-06
==================

  * Support the "new-style" VEP assertion format.  This avoids double-b64-
    encoding and generally results in smaller assertions.
  * Warn rather than fail if we can't find the CA certificates.  This will
    help new users get up and running more easily.
  * Add shortcut functions for verification with the default options.
    They are vep.verify(), vep.verify_remote(), vep.verify_local(), and 
    vep.verify_dummy().
  * Add vep.utils.get_assertion_info(), which parses useful information out
    of an assertion without actually verifying it.
  * Make LocalVerifier expire cached public keys after 6 hours by default.
  * Allow LocalVerifier to take a user-specified cache object so that public
    keys can be stored in e.g. memcached.
  * Update to the latest issuer-key-fetch protocol (using /.well-known/vep).
  * Add InvalidIssuerError to report on invalid or untrusted issuers.
  * Clean up the internal JWT interface.  It now uses module-level functions
    rather than classmethods.


0.2.1 - 2011-12-16
==================

 * Use M2Crypto for faster DSA operations.
 * DummyVerifier: fix hex formatting for compatability with jwcrypto.
 * DummyVerifier: don't emit FutureWarning on initialisation.


0.2.0 - 2011-12-07
==================

 * do more validation of the assertion before checking the certificates,
   to avoid expensive crypto ops for things we know to be invalid.
 * implement DummyVerifier class to aid in testing, both of this package
   and of packages that are using PyVEP.
 * add exception hierarchy in vep.errors, so that calling code can easily
   tell why verification failed.


0.1.1 - 2011-12-01
==================

 * add "diresworb.org" to default list of trusted secondaries.
 * implement additional signature algorithms.
 * if "hostname/.well-known/host-meta" gives a 404, fall back to "hostname/pk"
   to find the public key.


0.1.0 - 2011-11-23
==================

 * initial release.
