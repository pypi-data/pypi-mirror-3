            ~ What is Tookit Library
        
            Tookit Library is a collection of useful python codes for general purpose usage.
        
            ~ Is it ready?
        
            Not yet. I use it personally. I don't think it is ready for production usage, although the code is quite solid.
        
            ~ What do I need?
        
            Python 2.6+. I haven't testd it against Python 3.
        
            ~ Where are the docs?
        
            I am preparing the docs. In the mean time, the source code is extensively commented. You could read the source code directly.
        
            ~ Where can I get help?
        
            Please email to toolkit.library.feedback@gmail.com, I will try my best to help you.
