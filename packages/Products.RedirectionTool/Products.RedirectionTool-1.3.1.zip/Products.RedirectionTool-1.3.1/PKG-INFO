        About
        -----
          The Redirection Tool allows the management of the aliases stored in
          "plone.app.redirector":http://pypi.python.org/pypi/plone.app.redirector.
        
        
        Using The RedirectionTool
        -------------------------
          To make a redirection to a piece of
          content...
        
            1. Navigate to that content.
        
            2. Click the Aliases tab.
        
            3. Enter the short name or the absolute path that should redirect to the
               content.
        
            4. Click Add.
        
          There is also a Redirection and Aliases control panel under Site Setup which
          presents all the redirections in the site in one place, allows enabling and
          disabling alias management per content type, and lets you upload redirections
          in bulk.

        ------------------

        - Updated for Plone 3 by using plone.app.redirector, replacing skin parts

          existing redirections on install.
          [fschulze]
        
        - Use new permission "RedirectionTool: Modify aliases" for the alias tab.
          [fschulze]
        
        - When adding an alias a security check is performed on the source path.
          This prevents users from linking to their own content from locations to
          which they normally don't have access.
          [fschulze]
        
        Prior 1.2
