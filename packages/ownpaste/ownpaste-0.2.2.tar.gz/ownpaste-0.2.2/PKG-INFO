Description: ownpaste
        ========
        
        ownpaste is a pastebin web application, designed to be used as a
        personal/private pastebin.
        
        This project is motivated by the difficulty of maintain a public pastebin
        service nowadays, without time expiration and heavy spam filters. This is
        the reason why services like http://paste.pocoo.org/ are shutting down.
        
        A simple private pastebin application, that you can run by yourself, that
        provides a nice RESTful API, allowing the creation of cool clients, and that
        can highlight your files nicely, without the risk of get offline tomorrow
        due to spam issues looks like a nice idea in this current scenario.
        
        ownpaste uses the Flask_ web framework (and some of its extensions), the
        Pygments_ syntax highlighter and a few other well-known Python_ libraries.
