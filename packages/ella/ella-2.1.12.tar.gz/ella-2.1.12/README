Ella is opensource CMS based on Django framework,
designed for flexibility.

We are currently working on fixing compatibility with Django 1.3 which is
expected due to the end of January 2012. After that, we will roll out 
cleaning/refactoring roadmap and perfom major cleanup to Ella's sources.

The code is currently production-ready but has some rough edges in administration
interface which is called Newman.
