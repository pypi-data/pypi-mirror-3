Here are some of the guidelines about form rendering, followed in this 
application.

* Where a web designer contributes to project, use templates rather than 
  Python scripts

* Put CSS classes to container, so that both container and contained element
  can be styled.
  As an example use:

  .. code-block::html

    <div class="hasErrors"><label /><input /></div>

  rather than:

  .. code-block::html

    <div><label class="hasErrors" /><input /></div>
  
  because the graphic designer may want the DIV's background or the INPUT's 
  border to be red.
