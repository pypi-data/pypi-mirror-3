                    A Bayesian Skill Rating System


~ What's TrueSkill(TM)?
    
  TrueSkill(TM) is a rating system among game players and it is used
  on Xbox Live to rank and match players. TrueSkill system quantizes
  "TRUE" skill points by a Bayesian inference algorithm.

~ Tutorial

  Let's suppose that our sample game is 2:1. `Rating` objects mean
  each game players' skill points:

  >>> from trueskill import Rating, transform_ratings
  >>> r1, r2, r3 = Rating(), Rating(), Rating()
  >>> team1 = (r1, r2)
  >>> team2 = (r3,)

  TrueSkill system uses Gaussian distribution as player's skill point.
  The initial mu(mean) of rating is 25 and the initial sigma(standard
  deviation) is 25/3.

  >>> [team1, team2]
  [(
    Rating(mu=25.000, sigma=8.333),
    Rating(mu=25.000, sigma=8.333)
  ), (
    Rating(mu=25.000, sigma=8.333)
  )]

  The first team has won the game. See the below transformation of the
  ratings:

  >>> transform_ratings([team1, team2])
  [(
    Rating(mu=25.604, sigma=8.075),
    Rating(mu=25.604, sigma=8.075)
  ), (
    Rating(mu=24.396, sigma=8.075)
  )]

  The mu values in the first team transform from 25 to 25.6 and in
  the second team transform from 25 to 24.4. The ratings were
  transformed just a little.

  But, how does it work if the second team player has beaten 2 players
  in the first team, by himself?

  >>> transform_ratings([team1, team2], ranks=[1, 0]) # reversed ranks
  [(
    Rating(mu=16.269, sigma=7.317),
    Rating(mu=16.269, sigma=7.317)
  ), (
    Rating(mu=33.731, sigma=7.317)
  )]

  In the first team, 25 to 16.3 and in the second team 25 to 33.7.
  Now we have large transformations because it is a surprising result
  that 1 player beats 2 players.

  It is just a simplest example. TrueSkill can estimate accurate
  skills in this way. We only need enough game results!
