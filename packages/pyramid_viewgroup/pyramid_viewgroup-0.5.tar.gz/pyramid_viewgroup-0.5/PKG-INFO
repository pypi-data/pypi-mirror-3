Description: pyramid_viewgroup
        ====================
        
        ``pyramid_viewgroup`` is an extension for the ``pyramid`` web framework. The
        extensio makes it possible to make a ``viewgroup`` declaration which acts
        much like ``view`` inasmuch as it results in a Pyramid view registration.
        Unlike a "normal" ``view`` registration, however, a ``viewgroup``
        registration refers to one or more other Pyramid views (matching them by
        name, ``for`` interface, and request type).  When a ``viewgroup`` is invoked
        (either via traversal or via programmatic view execution), a viewgroup will
        return a response which appends all the referenced view renderings together
        in a single body.
