Description: Imagy - make your website's images load upto 50% faster
        ===============
        
        Imagy is a file daemon, that watches your website's media root (where your images are stored) and automatically optimizes image files that are created or modified within. 
        
        Imagy uses *lossless compression*, so your users never have to load unnecessary bytes. Your images look the same, but load faster.
        
        A lot of work has gone into making it ``set-and-forget``. Instead of having to code up deamons, file watches and handle different file formats on your own, Imagy does all the work for you. All you need to do is
        ::
        
            imagy /awesome/images/
            
        and Imagy will start watching the directory ``/awesome/images/`` and all its subdirectories for images that get created or modified.
        
        The algorithms used are stable (don't further modify files after multiple invocations), however to make trying Imagy out as easy as possible, the default is to keep original files around for later reversal. 
        
        If you wish to stop using Imagy, run ``imagy --revert`` which will move all original images back to their initial location
        
        If you have (rightfully) come to the conclusion that you don't really need to keep originals around, set ``KEEP_ORIGINALS`` in ``config.py`` to ``False``. If you want to delete all already stored originals run ``imagy --deloriginals``.
        
        
        Getting Started 
        -----------------
        
        
        Imagy depends on a bunch of binaries (listed at the bottom) for image optimization. On Ubuntu (tested on 11.10) you can install everything with:
        
        ::
        
            sudo apt-get install pngnq pngcrush imagemagick gifsicle libjpeg-progs
        
            pip install imagy
            
        
        That's it. Try it by running ``imagy``.
        
        If you don't have pip installed, you can find more information here: http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/installing.html#prerequisites
        
        
        Example Usage
        -----------------
        
        When starting out you can tell Imagy to optimize (initialize) a directory of new images:
        
        ::
        
            $ ll img
            total 52K
            -rw-rw-r-- 1 ddd ddd 50K 2012-06-23 14:45 beach.jpg
            $ imagy --init img
            2012-06-23 14:48:27,133 INFO         Imagy started
            2012-06-23 14:48:27,133 INFO         Storing settings in /home/ddd/.imagy, you can modify this path in config.py under STORE_PATH
            2012-06-23 14:48:27,134 INFO         looking for not yet optimized files
            2012-06-23 14:48:27,134 INFO         Compressing file /home/ddd/img/beach.jpg
            $ ll img
            total 80K
            -rw-rw-r-- 1 ddd ddd 25K 2012-06-23 14:48 beach.jpg
            -rw-rw-r-- 1 ddd ddd 50K 2012-06-23 14:48 beach-original.jpg
        
        Afterwards you can let imagy start watching the directory (and all directories underneath it) by running
        
        ::
        
            $ imagy img
            2012-06-23 14:52:24,794 INFO         Imagy started
            2012-06-23 14:52:24,794 INFO         Storing settings in /home/ddd/.imagy, you can modify this path in config.py under STORE_PATH
            2012-06-23 14:52:24,795 WARNING      watching /home/ddd/img
            2012-06-23 14:52:24,796 INFO         waiting for files
            2012-06-23 14:52:24,796 INFO         Ctrl-C to quit
        
        
        Credits
        -----------------
        
        In the background Imagy uses the awesome library ``smush.py`` which exposes a general interface to handle the various file types.
