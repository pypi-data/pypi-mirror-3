LaTeX2Markdown
==============

An AMSTeX compatible converter from (a subset of) LaTeX to MathJaX
compatible Markdown.

Who should use this?
--------------------

Anyone who writes LaTeX documents using the AMSTeX packages
(``amsmath``, ``amsthm``, ``amssymb``) and wants to convert these
documents to Markdown format to use with MathJaX. The outputted Markdown
files can then be easily added to any web platform - Jekyll blogs,
Wordpress, basic HTML sites, etc.

In short, if you seek to use MathJaX to view your LaTeX documents
online, then you might be interested in this.

Why not use Pandoc?
-------------------

Pandoc is an excellent document converter for less complex LaTeX
documents. Unfortunately, it is not designed to deal with documents that
use the AMSTeX extensions - which include the theorem, lemma, proof, and
exercise environments that are heavily used for typesetting papers,
lecture notes, and other documents.

As neither Pandoc nor MathJax can deal with these documents, I hacked
together a set of regular expressions that can convert a subset of LaTeX
to Markdown, and used a few more to convert this Markdown to
MathJaX-convertible Markdown.

What's an example?
------------------

Go to `tullo.ch/LaTeX2Markdown <http://tullo.ch/LaTeX2Markdown>`_ for a
live demonstration of the converter.

As an example, the following LaTeX code:

::

    \section{Example Section}
    \begin{thm}[Euclid]
        There are infinitely many primes.
    \end{thm}

    \begin{proof}
        Suppose that $p_1 < p_2 < \dots < p_n$ are all of the primes. 
        Let $P = 1 + \prod_{i=1}^n p_i$ and let $p$ be a prime dividing $P$.

        Then $p$ can not be any of $p_i$, for otherwise $p$ would divide the 
        difference $P - \left(\prod_{i=1}^n p_i \right) - 1$, which is impossible. 
        So this prime $p$ is still another prime, and $p_1, p_2, \dots p_n$ 
        cannot be all of the primes.
    \end{proof}

is converted into the following Markdown:

::

    ###  Example Section
    #### Theorem 1 (Euclid)

    > There are infinitely many primes.

    #### Proof

    Suppose that $p_1 < p_2 < \dots < p_n$ are all of the primes. 
    Let $P = 1 + \prod_{i=1}^n p_i$ and let $p$ be a prime dividing $P$.

    Then $p$ can not be any of $p_i$, for otherwise $p$ would divide the difference 
    $P - \left(\prod_{i=1}^n p_i \right) - 1$, which is impossible. So this prime 
    $p$ is still another prime, and $p_1, p_2, \dots p_n$ cannot be all of the primes.

Usage
-----

Once the repository has been cloned, converting your LaTeX files is as
simple as calling:

::

    python latex2markdown.py path/to/latex/file path/to/output/markdown/file

For example, to compile the example LaTeX document, call

::

    python latex2markdown.py examples/latex_sample.tex markdown_example.tex
