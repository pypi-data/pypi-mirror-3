        ============
        
        This is a product to upload and manage files on issuu.com and use issuu.coms viewer within plone.
        You should add your issue id to /portal_properties (you get a free one at issuu.com ).
        (it will work without doing this, but the pdfs will then be store here: http://issuu.com/medialog.issuu/docs (for a limited time))
