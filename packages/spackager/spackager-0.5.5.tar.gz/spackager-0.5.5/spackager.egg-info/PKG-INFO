Description: Spackager
        single-page app compiler
        
        parses an HTML file for external resources (JavaScript, CSS and image files) and
        assembles them into a stand-alone document

        Usage:
          spac [options] <filename>
        
        Options:
          -l, --no-legacy
            Drop support for legacy browsers (namely Internet Explorer <8).
            This significantly reduces file size by not duplicating image data, and
            also prevents breaking validity by not adding MHTML-specific data before
            the doctype declaration.
