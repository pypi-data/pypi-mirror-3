Description: Welcome to Clyther's documentation!
        ===================================
        
        CLyther is a Python tool similar to Cython and PyPy. CLyther is a just-in-time specialization engine for OpenCL. 
        The main entry points for CLyther are its :class:`clyther.task` and :class:`clyther.kernel` decorators.
        Once a function is decorated with one of these the function will be compiled to OpenCL when called. 
        
        CLyther is a Python language extension that makes writing OpenCL code as easy as Python itself. 
        CLyther currently only supports a subset of the Python language definition but adds many new features to OpenCL. 
        
        CLyther exposes both the OpenCL C library as well as the OpenCL language to python.
        
        Objectives:
            * Make it easy for developers to take advantage of OpenCL
            * Take advantage existing Python numerical algorithms
            * Accelerate my code!
        
        
        Philosophy:
            * Enable users to have 100% control via Python. Access one to one mapping from Python to OpenCL.
            * Endorse native Python abstractions for convenience. e.g. Slice an array, pass a function as an argument.
        
        .. warning::
            
            This is a brand new version of CLyther. I have not released this yet. 
            
            * If you do decide to use it then please think about :ref:`contribute`.
