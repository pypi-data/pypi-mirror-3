Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        *Formerly collective.recipe.bootstrap*
        
        ``buildout.bootstrap`` is a buildout extension that adds a buildout *bootstrap.py* file to your buildout.
        
        It satisfies the use case of::
        
            "I want to keep my buildout's bootstrap.py file up to date without having to manually download it" 
        
        It also makes it easy to add a *bootstrap.py* file to a buildout created via::
        
            $ buildout init
        
        If you still don't understand consider the following: with this extension you can avoid having to type::
        
            $ curl -O https://raw.github.com/buildout/buildout/master/bootstrap/bootstrap.py
        
        You typically use this extension when you have created a new buildout and want to
        
            - Check it in to version control
            - Check it out somewhere else
        
        See ``docs/INSTALL.txt`` for installation instructions.
        
        Installation
        ============

            extensions =
