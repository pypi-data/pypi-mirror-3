js.jquery_fullcalendar
**********************

Introduction
============

This library packages `jQuery FullCalendar`_ for `fanstatic`_.

.. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
.. _`jQuery FullCalendar`: http://arshaw.com/fullcalendar

This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
directory in ``js.jquery_fullcalendar``) are published to some URL.
