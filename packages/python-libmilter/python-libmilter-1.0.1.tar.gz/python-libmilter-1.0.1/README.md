## INSTALL ##

1. If you have a .tar.gz, extract that first.

        tar -xvzf python-libmilter*.tar.gz

2. Now, just cd into the directory and install it

        cd python-libmilter*
        python setup.py install

That's it, that will install the the libmilter.py file into its proper place.
Do note that you can just drop libmilter.py into your project folder and use it that way too.  The whole point of this project is to maximize portability.
