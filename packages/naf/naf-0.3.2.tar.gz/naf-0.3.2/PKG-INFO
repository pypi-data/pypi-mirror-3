Description: Why?!
        =====
        
        Daily programming tasks, such as code compilation and running automated tests, often consumes a lot of time even on rather small projects.
        
        While alt-tabbing away from the command you just started, this simple tool will help you to get back on your development track as soon as possible.
        
        Saving you minutes every day :)
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        On Linux with pip::
        
            sudo pip install naf
        
        On Mac OS X with pip (with Growl installed)::
        
            sudo pip install growl-py
            sudo pip install naf
        
        On Windows:
        In theory, ``naf`` should work on Windows wth Growl for Windows (http://www.growlforwindows.com/) and growl-py installed.
        I would highly appreciate any feedback on this.
        
        From source::
        
            git clone git://github.com/knutz3n/naf.git
            cd naf
            sudo python setup.py install
        
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        ::
        
            naf mvn clean install
        
        This will run ``mvn clean install`` and notify you when the command has exited with the exit code it returned.
        
        
        Customization
        =============
        
        Customizations can be made by creating a file ``~/.naf.conf``.
        
        Default configuration::
        
            [Success]
            description = finished successfully
             in %s
            timeout     = -1
            show        = true
        
            [Failed]
            description = failed with return code %s
             in %s
            timeout     = -1
            show        = true
        
            [Aborted]
            description = was aborted after
             %s
            timeout     = -1
            show        = true
