Transifex: The Open Translation Platform
----------------------------------------

Transifex is a highly scalable localization platform with a focus on
integrating well with the existing workflow of both translators and developers.

It aims in making it dead-simple for content providers to receive quality
translations from big translation communities, no matter where the project
is hosted.

* Live common instance: http://www.transifex.net
* Development page:     http://transifex.org/


Goals
-----

* Provide an interface for translators to submit translations to multiple
  projects, regardless of the type of the underlying VCS

* Reduce the overhead a project maintainer usually undertakes to administrate
  accounts for translators

* Help translators do more by eliminating the need to subscribe to each VCS and
  learn its commands and tricks

* Encourage collaboration between developers and maintainers and thus, increase
  the language coverage of the participant projects
