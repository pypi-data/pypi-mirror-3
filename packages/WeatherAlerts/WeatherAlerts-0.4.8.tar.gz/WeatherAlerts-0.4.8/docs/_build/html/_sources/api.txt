API Usage
**********

If you're wanting to use this data in your project, there are a couple ways to do it. First (and recommended) 
you can create the object and request the alerts data from it, transforming and interacting with it as desired. 
Currently the module provides a json output that memics the CAP standard but with the addition of geodata and some
other manipulations. Second (and not recommended) you can take the formatted output from one of the output methods
and display that directly.
