    """`Adapter` to adapt Python_ `coroutines` to their provided `interfaces`.

    `Components`, classes and regular functions can (and are expected to) just
    declare provided interfaces directly.  They do not need this adapter.

    Python_ `coroutines`, on the other hand, are really instances of
    :class:`~types.GeneratorType`.  They cannot be made to directly declare
    proivided interfaces because one cannot add additional attributes to the
    `generator` object.  That is where this `adapter` comes in.

    This `adapter` just checks to see if the `coroutine` has a registered
    stand-in object in the registry and that the stand-in provides the given
    `interface`.  If it does, the `coroutine` is returned unchanged.
    Otherwise, :obj:`None` is returned, which signals that adaptation was not
    possible.

    Since the :func:`coroutine` decorator automatically registers interfaces
    implemented by the `coroutine`'s `factory` function as those provided by
    the `coroutine` itself, adaptation to the given `interface` happens
    transparently.

    :param interface_: The `interface` that must be provided.

    *coroutine_factory_path* is given as an import path string.  E.g.
    ``'m4us.core.coroutines.filter_from_callable'``.  The use of the template
    is required to preserve the function's signature on the curried factory.

    factory like :func:`filter_from_callable` which takes a function whose
