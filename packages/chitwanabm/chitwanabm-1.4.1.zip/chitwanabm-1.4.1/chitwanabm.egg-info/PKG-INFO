Description: 
        chitwanabm is an agent-based model of the Western Chitwan Valley, Nepal.  
        The model represents a subset of the population of the Valley using a 
        number of agent types (person, household and neighborhood agents), 
        environmental variables (topography, land use and land cover) and social 
        context variables.
        
        Construction of the model is supported as part of an ongoing National 
        Science Foundation Partnerships for International Research and Education 
        (NSF PIRE) project `(grant OISE 0729709) <http://pire.psc.isr.umich.edu>`_ 
        investigating human-environment interactions in the Western Chitwan Valley. 
        Development of the model is in progress, and model documentation is still 
        incomplete.  As work continues, this page will be updated with more 
        information on initializing and running the model, and on interpreting the 
        model output.
        
        See the `chitwanabm website 
        <http://rohan.sdsu.edu/~zvoleff/research/ChitwanABM.php>`_ for more 
        information, past releases, publications, and recent presentations.
