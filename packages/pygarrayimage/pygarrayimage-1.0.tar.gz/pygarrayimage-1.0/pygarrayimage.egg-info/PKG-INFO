Description: pygarrayimage allows display of Python objects supporting the array
        interface as OpenGL textures without a copy. The OpenGL texture
        handling is done using pyglet.
        
        In other words, this allows fast transfer of data from numpy arrays
        (or any other data source supporting the array interface) to the video
        card.
        
        TODO: support the buffer interface added with Python 2.6/3.0 rather
        than the numpy-defined array interface.
