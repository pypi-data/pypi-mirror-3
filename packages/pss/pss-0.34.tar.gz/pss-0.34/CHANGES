Changelog
=========

+ Version 0.34 (16.11.2011)

  - Added --noheading and --nobreak options (pull request #4 by Bernhard
    Leiner).
  - Issue #13: added the '-t/--textonly/--nobinary' option to restrict the
    search to textual files.
  - Issue #23: added 'txt' type for '.txt' and '.text' extensions
  - Added 'rst' type for '.rst' and '.rest' extensions (Restructured Text)
  - Issue #17: customize the colors used by pss for matches and filenames.
  - Added __pycache__ to the list of directories ignored by default.
  - Issue #20: Make -g cooperate with -a as expected.
  - Issue #16: Add F90 and F95 extensions for Fortran.
  - Issue #3: Allow specifying file types using patterns, not just extensions.
    Also adds new types: make, rake, cmake.

+ Version 0.33 (21.10.2011)

  - Issue #7: allow simple invocation of pss without installing, by directly
    passing the source directory to a Python interpreter.
  - Fixed a problem with the max-count option that was broken in some cases.
  - Fixed some encoding issues, and better handling of non-ASCII files when
    running on Python 3 (also reported in Issues #10 and #12). 
  - Issue #2: pss will now ignore broken symlinks (won't list them or try to
    read them).
  - Issue #5: When the output of pss is redirected, by default colors won't
    be applied (unless forced with --color). Pull request #2 by Pekka Kl√§rck.
  - Issue #6: Support -l and -L options (only show files with/without matches)
  - Issue #8: When Ctrl+C is hit, print a succinct error message instead of 
    the full stack trace.

+ Version 0.32 (14.10.2011)

  - Move pss.py from scripts/ to psslib/, leaving just a wrapper call to 
    pss.py's main() in scripts/pss.py and scripts/pss. This is better than
    the previous solution of having a symlink in scripts/ because pip on
    Python 2.6 doesn't handle symlinks too well.

+ Version 0.31 - Initial public release (14.10.2011)
