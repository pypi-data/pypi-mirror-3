This is a start for django-survey. It is currently a fork of:
http://code.google.com/p/django-survey/

as not much seems to be happening with it. I've made a few changes and have
made them available here under the same MIT license.

ADDENDUM - 24 Jul 2010

I wasn't crazy about surveys being under the "detail" url pattern.

Instead, each survey slug is at the root directory of the app.

Thus, you can wire it up to your project so the urls look like:

  http://wherever.com/surveys/amazing-product-launch-survey

Instead of:

  http://wherever.com/surveys/detail/amazing-product...etcetera
