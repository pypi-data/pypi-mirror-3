        gravnoise is a block-based, gravity-infused puzzle game: it is a bit of a
        tetris clone.
        
        It features annoying graphics.

        Installation
        ============
        
        Dependencies
        ------------
        
        gravnoise depends on argparse and pygame. From Python 3.2, argparse is included
        in Python. If you're using Python 3.x, x < 2, you can download argparse from
        https://code.google.com/p/argparse/
        
        gravnoise will also use the Python packages termcolor and setproctitle
        (available at PyPi) if present.
