        Motivation
        **********
        The Italian participation at the 2010 South African world cup whose a complete 
        disaster and watching our beloved team was a nightmare.
        
        While watching our last at the office, in order to survive to this shame, 
        I started a BDD_ package that would inject a **vuvuzela** on a Plone site.
        
        In order to share my pain I then decided to publish this package.
        
        ************
        Installation
        ************
        Add to your buildout the following code::
        
          [instance]
          ...
          eggs =
            ...
            rt.vuvuzela
            ...
        
          # Not required for Plone >= 3.3
          zcml =
            ...
            rt.vuvuzela
            ...
        
        ****
        Todo
        ****
        Add:
         - a portlet 
         - a viewlet
        
        *************
        How to use it
        *************
        Come on man! Are you sure? 
        
        Ok, if you are brave enough just add `@@vuvuzela` to the url of your Plone site, pointing to a url like this http://localhost:8080/Plone/@@vuvuzela
        
        Forgive me, please :)
