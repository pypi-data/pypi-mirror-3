--- # Experiment 03
# This file is part of FMS, a Financial Market Simulator
#
# This experiment simulates a synchronous market,
# driven by order books, with a final 'fixing' clearing.
# The fixing price is chosen to maximize the volume of transactions
# at this price.
# The orders are read from a file (using again the PlayOrderLogFile agent),
# allowing to calculate the fixing price in advance, to check for the
# market class accuracy.
#
# Experiment steps : 
# - the engine chooses an agent randomly (with replacement)
# - the agent reads an order from the logfile
# - the order goes in the buy or sellbook, depending on direction
#
# These steps are run 'daylength' times (12 if you use this file unmodified).
# Once these steps are completed, the clearing method of the market is called,
# the fixing price is calculated and all possible transactions at this price
# output to the 'outputfilename'.
#
# Run with :
# $ startfms.py run exp03.yml
# This should produce 1 file :
# - exp03.csv the resulting transactions file 
#
outputfilename: exp03.csv
