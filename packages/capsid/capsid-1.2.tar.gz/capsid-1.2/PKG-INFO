        *Release date: 20 Jan 2012*
        
        * Utility to create FastQ files from unmapped reads
        * Utility to return intersection of FastQ files
        * Utility to return filter FastQ files
        * Added mapq threshold flag to subtraction
        * Gbloader can now load bacteria and fungal genomes
        * Saves genome sequences to database using GridFS
        * Reduced memory footprint when calculating statistics
        * use subprocesses instead of os.system
        * mapq scores filter needs to include 0 <= mapq <=3 due to multiple mapping reads
