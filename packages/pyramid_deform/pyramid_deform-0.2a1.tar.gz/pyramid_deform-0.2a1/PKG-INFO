        0.2a1 (2012-01-28)
        ------------------
        
        - This is an alpha release solely because documentation is incomplete.
        
        - Add usage example for FormView class.
        
        - Fix syntax error in javascript when ajax_options are not specified. Use a 
          string representing an empty javascript object as the default for 
          ajax_options.
        
        - Add CSRFSchema class API.
        
        0.1.6 (2011-03-24)
        ------------------
        
        - Allow wizard schemas to have an "appstruct" attribute; these are used
          for wizard edit forms.
        
        0.1.5 (2011-03-23)
        ------------------
        
        - Respect a ``wizard_serializer`` attribute of a schema to allow for munging
          of the validated data before it is pickled and after it is unpickled.
        
        0.1.4 (2010-12-17)
        ------------------
        
        - Make it possible for schemas to have a ``prev_ok`` and ``next_ok``
          attribute, which should be callables.  If either returns ``False``, the
          corresponding button on the form will be disabled (requires deform>=0.8.1).
        
        0.1.3 (2010-12-02)
        ------------------
        
        - Add classes and current step info to form wizard.
        
        0.1.2 (2010-12-1)
        ------------------
        
        - Another not-ready-for-primetime customer release: add ``get_summary()``
          method to form wizard.
        
        0.1.1 (2010-11-30)
        ------------------
        
        - Another not-ready-for-primetime customer release: refactor wizard state
          mutation and allow wizard states to be retrieved by name.
         
        0.1 (2010-11-28)
        ----------------
        
        - Not-ready-for-primetime release for customer (not uploaded to PyPI).
