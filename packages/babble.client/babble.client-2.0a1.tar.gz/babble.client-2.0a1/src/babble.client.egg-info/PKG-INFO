        Babble: Instant Messaging for Plone
        -----------------------------------
        
        Babble is an instant messaging service for Plone. 
        It consists of babble.client as the Plone front-end client and 
        `babble.server <http://plone.org/products/babble.server>`_, 
        a Zope2-based messaging service, as the backend chat service.
        
        Communication between the client and server is achieved with JSON packets 
        sent via XML-RPC. 
        
        The client consists of an *Online contacts* portlet with which you can initiate 
        new chats. 
        
        Instead of using the provided portlet, you can also consider using Babble together with
        `actionbar.babble <http://plone.org/products/actionbar.babble>`_ .
        
        Chat sessions occur in modal dialog chatboxes and make use of 
        JQuery Ajax polling to provide seamless, real-time messaging.
        
        During inactive periods, the polling interval gradually becomes longer until it
        reaches a specific (configurable) maximum polling interval.
        
        Please note: even thought the polling values are configurable, it's not advised
        to make the minimum polling interval less than 5000 milliseconds.
        
        
        
        Features:
        ---------
        
        - Remembers open chat windows on page reload
        - Chat windows can be minimized
        - New messages automatically opens chat window
        - An 'online users' portlet provides a list of currently online users
        - Configurable polling intervals
        - Clickable URLs recieved via chat messages
        - Requests to the messaging service are password authenticated
        - Can be `integrated <http://plone.org/products/actionbar.babble>`_ with the 
          ActionBar of `actionbar.panel <http://plone.org/products/actionbar.panel/>`_
        - Can run on a different server than the messaging service

        TODO:
        -----
        
        - Remove the DTML variables by getting them from the DOM. Then we can use jUnit
          for unit testing the js.
