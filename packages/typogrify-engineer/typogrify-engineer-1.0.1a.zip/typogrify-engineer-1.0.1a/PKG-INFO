Description: Note: This is a fork of [a fork](hyde) of the original `typogrify` 
        project made especially for [Engineer][]. The modifications are very 
        minor, so you should look at the [documentation](hyde) for the hyde 
        fork to get a sense of what it does.
        
        Modifications:
        
        - SmartyPants defaults changed so that `--` is interpreted as an en-dash 
        and `---` is interpreted as an em-dash. I don't know why in the world this 
        isn't the default.
