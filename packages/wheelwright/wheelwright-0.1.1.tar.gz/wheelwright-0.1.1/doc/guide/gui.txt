Using Wheelwright
=================

.. admonition:: Units

   Tensions are reported in `kilograms-force
   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram-force>`_ (kgf), a non-SI
   unit of force common in the bicycle industry.

   1 kgf = 9.81 Newton

Starting Wheelwright
--------------------

Click on the Wheelwright icon or use the ``wheelwright`` command to
start the application.

Specifying information about your wheel
---------------------------------------

First off, you need to set some information about your wheel.

* **Spoke Type**: Find your spokes in the pull-down menu. For butted spokes, use the smallest diameter.
* **Target Tension**: Ideally, this number should come from the rim manufacturer. For most rims 110 kgf is a good target. Some manufacturers recommend slightly tighter spokes for the rear wheel, for example, 115 kgf.
* **Target Accuracy**: This is the accuracy you choose for your wheel. For a target tension of 100 kgf, an accuracy of 0.10 means that tensions between 90--110 kgf will be considered in spec. (This in-spec region is shown as a green band in the plots.)
* **Number of Spokes**: This is the number of spokes on each side of the wheel. Wheelwright assumes this is the same on each side.

Entering spoke tensions
-----------------------

Now you are ready to enter the tension of each spoke.

Pick a spoke and go around entering the deflection reading from Park
Tool's TM-1 tension meter. Wheelwright does the conversion to
kilograms-force.

.. admonition:: Interpolation accuracy

   Wheelwright interpolates to find the tension (in kgf) for a given
   TM-1 deflection reading. Like all interpolations, this can be quite
   poor outside of the calibration range. Especially for small
   deflection readings (less than 10), the interpolated tension
   shouldn't be trusted.

Which spokes you choose to call the *right* and *left* doesn't really
matter, although you might as well choose the drive- and
non-drive-side spokes, respectively. Also, where you start (spoke #1)
isn't important. Starting at the valve hole is a convenient way to
keep the spokes straight.

For a dished wheel --- such as a rear wheel or a front wheel with a
disc-brake hub --- the tension will be higher on one side. You want
the higher tension side to be within spec. Whatever tension the
non-dished side ends up at isn't important as long as it's roughly
uniform and the wheel is trued and dished.
