Welcome to pyvttbl's documentation!
===================================

Pivot tables (also called contingency tables and cross tabulation tables) 
are a powerful means of data visualization and data summarization. When 
dealing with large data sets with multiple variables, or multiple 
datasets manually manipulating the pivot tables in WYSIWYG (what you see 
is what you get) spreadsheets can quickly become troublesome and error 
prone. In these instances it becomes preferred or even necessary to use 
a YAFIYGI (you ask for it you got it) model to automate all or part of 
the data summarization process.
