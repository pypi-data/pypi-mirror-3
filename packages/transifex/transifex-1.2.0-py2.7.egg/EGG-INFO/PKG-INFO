        Transifex: The Open Translation Platform
        ----------------------------------------
        
        Transifex is a highly scalable localization platform with a focus on
        integrating well with the existing workflow of both translators and developers.
        
        It aims in making it dead-simple for content providers to receive quality
        translations from big translation communities, no matter where the project
        is hosted.

        Goals
        -----
        
        * Provide an interface for translators to submit translations to multiple
          projects, regardless of the type of the underlying VCS
        
        * Reduce the overhead a project maintainer usually undertakes to administrate
          accounts for translators
        
        * Help translators do more by eliminating the need to subscribe to each VCS and
          learn its commands and tricks
        
        * Encourage collaboration between developers and maintainers and thus, increase
          the language coverage of the participant projects
