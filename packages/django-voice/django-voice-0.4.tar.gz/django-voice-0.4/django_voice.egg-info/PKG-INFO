        ============
        
        django-voice is a very simple application to enable user feedback that is integrated with your Django project. Originally built for Verb (http://verbapp.com).
        
        IMPORTANT: Upgrading to 0.4 from older versions
        ===============================================
        If you upgrade django-voice to 0.4 from older versions, you will take an error about database changing::
        
            DatabaseError at /feedback/
        
            no such column: djangovoice_feedback.email
        
        You have two ways for fixing the problem.
        
        If you use South..
        ------------------
        Run this command::
        
            python manage.py migrate djangovoice
        
        If you think to use South..
        ---------------------------
        Pass first migration and implement second migration::
        
            python manage.py migrate --fake djangovoice 0001
            python manage.py migrate djangovoice
        
        If you don't want to use South..
        --------------------------------
        Open your SQL shell and add email column to djangovoice_feedback::
        
            python manage.py dbshell
        
            sqlite> ALTER TABLE "djangovoice_feedback" ADD COLUMN "email" varchar(75) NULL;
            sqlite> ALTER TABLE "djangovoice_feedback" ADD COLUMN "slug" varchar(10) NULL;
        
        That's it..
        
        Installation and Dependencies
        =============================
        
        To satisfy dependencies listed in REQUIREMENTS you can simply run this command:
        
        ::
        
          pip -r REQUIREMENTS
        
        
        'pip' will automatically download and install dependencies required for django-voice. Next step is activating helper applications to run.
        
        * Activate django's comment system. (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/comments/)
        * Add django-gravatar and django-voting to your INSTALLED_APPS in settings file.
        * Add comments and django-voice to your url configration.
        * Create at least one Type and Status either through the admin or fixtures.
        
        After these steps, your INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py must be seen like this:
        
        ::
        
          INSTALLED_APPS = (
              ...
              'voting',
              'gravatar',
              'djangovoice'
          )
        
        and urls.py like this:
        
        ::
        
          urlpatterns = patterns(
              ...
              url(r'^comments/', include('django.contrib.comments.urls')),
              url(r'^feedback/', include('djangovoice.urls')))
        
        Remember to create and save at least one Type and Status model instance.
        
        That's all you need to run django-voice.
        
        Settings
        ========
        
        ::
        
          VOICE_ALLOW_ANONYMOUS_USER_SUBMIT (default: False)
            Allow unsigned user to submit feedback. Asks user e-mail and marks
            the feedback as private to prevent public spam.
