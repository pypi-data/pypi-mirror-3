        0.1.2
        -----
        
        * trace factory made configurable via Configuration.trace attribute
        
        * method and PATH_INFO extraction delegated to configuration, allows
          implementing routing for other request wrapper (werkzeug or django's request
          for example)
        
        * routes now have access to configuration object via ``cfg`` attribute
        
        0.1.1
        -----
        
        * allow guards return None (routing doesn't break on this and proceed with old
          trace)
        
        * RequestParams now can accept colander.SchemaNode directly (allows to supply
          validators)
