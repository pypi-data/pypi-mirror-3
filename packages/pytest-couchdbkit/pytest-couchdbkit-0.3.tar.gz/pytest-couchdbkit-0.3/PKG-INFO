Description: pytest-couchdbkit
        =================
        
        pytest-couchdbkit is a simple pytest extension that manages test databases
        for your couchdbkit using apps.
        
        In order to use it, you only need to set the ini option
        `couchdbkit_suffix` to something fitting your app.
        Additionally you may use `couchdbkit_backend` to select
        the gevent/eventlet backends.
        
        
        
        The provided funcarg `couchdb` will be a freshly flushed database
        named `pytest_` + couchdbkit_suffix,
        additionally, after each test item,
        the database will be dumped to tmpdir.join(couchdb.dump)
        
        which is a simple file having entries in the format::
        
            number(\d+) + "\r\n" + number bytes + "\r\n"
        
        entries are:
        
        * the db info
        * documents
        * raw attachment data following the document
        
        Attachments are ordered by name,
        so they can be reassigned to their metadata on loading.
        
        The dump format is meant to be human-readable.
        
        
        
        Future
        ------
        
        * fs fixtures (like couchapp)
        * code fixtures
        * dump fixtures
        * comaring a db to sets of defined fixtures
