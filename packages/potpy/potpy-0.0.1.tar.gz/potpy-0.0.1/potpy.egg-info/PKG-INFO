Description: PotPy
        =====
        
        PotPy lets you build applications in a very flexible way. You design objects
        based on your domain requirements, then compose them together using PotPy's
        flexible routing system. PotPy enables you to:
        
        * **Write simple, decoupled objects** that work together in various ways.
        * **Easily test your objects**, by not imposing a rigid object construction
          paradigm.
        * **Write WSGI components using TDD**, without having to deal with WSGI
          conventions except at the edges of the system.
