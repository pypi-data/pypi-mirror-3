What is Moksha?
===============

A Platform
~~~~~~~~~~
A highly scalable platform for creating dashboards of live collaborative
widgets.  Moksha makes it simple for these widgets to extract and extend data
from arbitrary resources in an intuitive and efficient manner.

A Framework
~~~~~~~~~~~
Compiled from the best-of-breed components, Moksha applications are written
using stable pre-existing modules that allow for the rapid creation of powerful
applications.  It is designed to allow non-developers to easily develop
applications in isolation, without worrying about the under/over-lying software
stack.

An Architecture
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Moksha brings many existing technologies together to create a next-generation
web architecture that is designed to simplify the creation of rich,
powerful, live web applications that can easily bridge existing services.

A Hub
~~~~~
Moksha also acts as a live notification hub that allows people and other
applications and services to create, publish, and subscribe to arbitrary
message streams.
