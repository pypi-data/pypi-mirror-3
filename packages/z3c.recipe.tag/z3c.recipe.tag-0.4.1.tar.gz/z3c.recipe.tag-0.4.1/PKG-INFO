        Introduction
        ------------
        
        This recipe generates a TAGS database file that can be used with a
        number of different editors to quickly lookup class and function
        definitions in your package's source files and egg dependencies.
        
        Dependencies
        ------------
        
        Before running a tags enabled buildout, you must install the
        appropriate command line tag generation tools: exuberant-ctags and
        id-utils.  In Ubuntu, you can install these with apt-get::
        
          $ sudo apt-get install exuberant-ctags id-utils
        
        On a Mac, download and install ``port`` from http://www.macports.org/ and then
        install ctags and idutils in this way::
        
          $ sudo port install ctags idutils
        
        How to use this recipe
        ----------------------
        
        With Buildout
        .............
        
        Suppose you have an egg called ``MyApplication``.  To use this recipe with
        buildout, you would add the following to the ``buildout.cfg`` file::
        
          [tags]
          recipe = z3c.recipe.tag:tags
          eggs = MyApplication
        
        This produces a script file in the ``bin/`` directory which you can
        then run like this::
        
          $ ./bin/tags
        
        By default, this script produces three files in the directory from
        which you ran the script:
        
        - a ctags file called ``TAGS`` for use by emacs,
        - a ctags file called ``tags`` for use by vi, and
        - an idutils file called ``ID`` for use by either.
        
        You can then use these file in your editor of choice.
        
        Optionally, you can select which files to build.  The following is the output
        of ``./bin/tags --help``::
        
            usage: build_tags [options]
        
            options:
              -h, --help            show this help message and exit
              -l LANGUAGES, --languages=LANGUAGES
                                    ctags comma-separated list of languages. defaults to
                                    ``-JavaScript``
              -e, --ctags-emacs     flag to build emacs ctags ``TAGS`` file
              -v, --ctags-vi        flag to build vi ctags ``tags`` file
              -b, --ctags-bbedit    flag to build bbedit ctags ``tags`` file
              -i, --idutils         flag to build idutils ``ID`` file
        
        With Paver
        ..........
        
        If you are using `Paver
        <http://www.blueskyonmars.com/projects/paver/>`_ and already have
        z3c.recipe.tag installed, then all you have to do is add this line to
        your ``pavement.py`` file::
        
          import z3c.recipe.tag
        
        And then run the ``z3c.recipe.tag.tags`` task from the command line::
        
          $ paver z3c.recipe.tag.tags

          - to jump to the location of a tag, type ``M-x find-tag`` and the
            name of the tag.  Or use ``M-.`` to jump to the tag matching the token
            the cursor is currently on.  The first time you do this, you will
            be prompted for the location of the TAGS file.

        ------------------
        
        * Skip nonexistent sys.path directories to avoid ctags warnings.
        
        
        0.4.0 (2010-08-29)
        ------------------
        
        * Support new script features from zc.buildout 1.5 and higher.  This version
          requires zc.buildout 1.5 or higher.
        
        * Also index Mako and HTML files with id-utils.
        
        
        0.3.0 (2009-08-16)
        ------------------
        
        * Add support for using this recipe as a `paver <http://www.blueskyonmars.com/projects/paver/>`_ task.
        
        * Also index Javascript, CSS and ReStructuredText files with id-utils.
        
        * Define a default entry point for zc.buildout, so you can simply say::
        
            [ctags]
            recipe = z3c.recipe.tag

        ------------------
        
        * Allow command-line choices for what files to build, and what languages ctags

          is the same as previous releases.)
        
        * Support the Mac OS X packaging system "macports" (exuberant ctags is
          ``ctags-exuberant`` in Ubuntu and ``ctags`` in macports).
        
        * Support creating BBEdit-style ctags files.
        
        * Small changes for development (use bootstrap external, set svn:ignore)
