Description: # ReviewDay
        
        HTML report generator for OpenStack code reviews. Launchpad meets SmokeStack and Gerrit.
        
        Based on and inspired by 'reviewlist' by Thierry Carez.
        
        ## Description
        
        HTML report generator which creates a prioritized review list w/ function test results. The report includes:
        
        * Prioritized listing of merge proposals by project
        * Direct links to gerrit code reviews
        * Direct links to test results for each branch (Unit, Libvirt, XenServer)
        
        ## Installation
        
        Install directly from pip (requires launchpadlib and cheetah):
        
        	pip install reviewday
        
        You'll also need a working gerrit setup: http://wiki.openstack.org/GerritWorkflow
        Specifically you'll need to be able to run gerrit command line queries.
        
        ## Execution
        
        	reviewday
        
        An output directory called 'out_report' is generated in your working directory.
        
        ## Execution (Development)
        
        	PYTHONPATH=$PWD ./bin/reviewday
