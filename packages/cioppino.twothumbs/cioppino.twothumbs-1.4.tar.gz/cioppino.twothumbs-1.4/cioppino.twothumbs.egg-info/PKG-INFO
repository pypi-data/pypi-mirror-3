Description: Introduction
        ============
        This will add those terribly "delish" little thumbs all over facebook 
        to products of your choosing. By default, only logged in users can rate 
        a product, and once they are logged in they can vote once (and change 
        their vote at any time)
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        Your mission, should you choose to accept it is to add the package to 
        your buildout config and rerun buildout. If you want it as a viewlet 
        below the content title, you must follow the viewlet directions below 
        before restarting and installing. Otherwise install immediately and then 
        skip to the section on browser views.
        
        As a Viewlet
        ------------
        Then, in the configure.zcml 
        in the base of your product you need to tell which content types should 
        display the thumbs. For example, with the PloneSoftwareCenter product, 
        the configure.zcml has the lines::
        
            <include package="cioppino.twothumbs" />
            <class class=".content.project.PSCProject">
               <implements interface="cioppino.twothumbs.interfaces.ILoveThumbsDontYou" />
            </class>
            
        That little diddy would add the thumbs viewlet to the PSCProject 
        product only. You only need to include the package 1 time but you 
        need to add the class block for every content type you would like 
        to show the thumbs.
        
        As a Browser View
        -----------------
        Additionally, you can generate the widget on any content page in any place
        by just adding a few lines to your template::
            
            <div tal:content="structure here/@@rate-if-you-dare"/>
        
        
        Migration
        ---------
        If you used to use plone.contentratings and want to migrate to the thumbs 
        product, there is an example in the trunk of PloneSoftwareCenter. It's 
        pretty easy. Please see http://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/Products.PloneSoftwareCenter/tags/1.6.1/Products/PloneSoftwareCenter/Extensions/migrateratings.py for an example.

        This product was initially developed at the Plone Cioppino Sprint in 
        Bodega Bay 2011. The source code is filled with plenty of inside jokes 
        and may only be maintainable after drinking copious numbers of 
        Manhattans. Without the [drink] support of everyone there, this may not 
        have been made possible. Big ups.
