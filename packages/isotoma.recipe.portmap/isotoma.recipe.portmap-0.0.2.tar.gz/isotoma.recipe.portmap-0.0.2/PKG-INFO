Description: Portmap buildout recipe
        =======================
        
        This package provides a buildout_ recipe to calculate TCP port offsets.  This
        is useful when you are installing a stack of software, with multiple parts
        needing TCP port numbers.
        
        The calculated values are provided as buildout parameters in the section for
        which this is the recipe.
        
        .. _buildout: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zc.buildout
        
        For example::
        
            [ports]
            recipe = isotoma.recipe.portmap
            base = 8080
            offsets = 
                foo 0
                bar 1
        
            [baz]
            recipe = build.me.a.foo
            port = ${ports:foo}
        
            [qux]
            recipe = a.bar.if.you.please
            listen = tcp:${ports:bar}
        
        This recipe will also produce an "INI file" called portmap.txt in the parts
        directory, which is useful for reference if nothing else.
