Description: Expands the standard django.contrib.sites package to allow for:
            Sites identified dynamically from the request via middleware
            No need for multiple virtual hosts at the webserver level
            301 Redirects to canonical hostnames
            A site may have its own urls.py and templates
            A single site may accept requests from multiple hostnames
            Allows for environment hostname mappings to use non-production hostnames (for use in dev, staging, test, etc. environments)
Platform: any
