        Why use this?
        =============
        
        Standardized sampledata makes it soo much easier to work on a project
        (especially when working in teams).
        
        This package eases the generation of sampledata for your plone project.
        
        
        How to use it
        =============
        
        For developers working on a project there's a view listing and running
        all available sampledata plugins:
        
        http://localhost/plone/@@sampledata
        
        .. image:: http://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/wm.sampledata/trunk/docs/screenshot.png
           :alt: Screenshot of the @@sampledata with enabled example plugin
        
        By default the view does not list any plugins.
        The screen above shows the example plugin activated via ``<include package="wm.sampledata.example" />``.
        
        
        Writing and registering your custom sampledata plugin is very easy::
        
            class MyPlugin(object):
                implements(ISampleDataPlugin)
        
                title = u"My Plugin Content"
                description = u"Creates a portlet"
        
                def generate(self, context):
                    portlet = StaticAssignment(u"Sample Portlet", "<p>some content</p>")
                    addPortlet(context, 'plone.leftcolumn', portlet)
        
            myPlugin = MyPlugin()
            component.provideUtility(myPlugin,
                                     ISampleDataPlugin
                                     'my.plugin')
        
        See `wm.sampledata.example`__
        for a complete example of a custom plugin.
        
        .. __: http://dev.plone.org/collective/browser/wm.sampledata/trunk/wm/sampledata/example
        
        There is a growing set of utility methods in ``wm.sampledata.utils`` (eg for
        handling portlets and files) which you can use in your plugins.
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        
        Simply add ``wm.sampledata`` to your buildout's instance eggs - a zcml slug is not needed
        in plone versions that ship with z3c.autoinclude (Plone>=3.3)::
        
            [buildout]
            ...
            eggs =
                ...
                wm.sampledata
        
        
        
        Why yet another package?
        ========================
        
        There are several other packages for generating test/sampledata but none of them
        fitted my usecase. (Which is providing a user interface for pluggable sampledata generators
        so developers/skinners can use standardized data when developing on a project)
        
        A while ago i `asked what other people do on plone.users`__

        z3c.sampledata
            Would do the same and much more (dependencies, groups, configuration ui for each plugin)
        
            for me it was too complex to get it running on my zope2 instance and it
            seems to be tailored for zope3 anyway.
        
            Basically it would be great to make wm.sampledata use z3c.sampledata
            and provide plone specific plugins for it.

        `ely.contentgenerator`_
            provides a xml syntax to create samplecontent,
            might be useful to use in custom plugins
        
            .. _`ely.contentgenerator`: http://ely.googlecode.com/svn/ely.contentgenerator
        
        
        collective.contentgenerator
            looks like this is meant for creating (random) sampledata for stresstests
        
        
        Changelog
        =========
        
        0.2 (2011-12-02)
        ----------------
        
        - ``SampledataView.runPlugin`` returns the result of ``Plugin.generate``.
          This makes it easy to check if the plugin was sucessfully run in unittests.
        
        
        - fix links for running plugins so they work for
          http://host/plonesite/@@sampledata, too.
          (not just http://host/@@sampledata)
