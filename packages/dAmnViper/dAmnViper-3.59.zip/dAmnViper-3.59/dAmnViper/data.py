    This module provides the Channel object, which represents a
    joined channel. The object stores information about the channel,
    such as the title/topic, and users in the channel.

from dAmnViper.parse import Packet

class Channel(object):
    """ Objects representing dAmn channels.
    
        Information about the channels are stored in here. The different
        attributes of the object are as follows:
        
        * ``title`` - This is an instance of the class
          ``Channel.header``, and stores information about the title of
          the channel. The object has the attributes ``content``, ``by``
          and ``ts``. These store the content of the title, the person
          who set the title, and the timestamp from when they set it,
          respectively.
        * ``topic`` - Similar to the ``title`` attribute, but it stores
          information about the channel's topic, as opposed to the
          channel's title.
        * ``pc`` - Stores information about the channel's privclasses.
        * ``pc_order`` - A list storing the the privclass names in order
          of hierarchy. This is to allow applications to display
          information more easily if needed.
        * ``member`` - A dictionary storing information about each user
          currently in the channel.
        * ``namespace`` - The channel's full namespace. This is usually
          a string in the form ``chat:channel_name``. This can differ
          depending on the type of channel the object represents.
        * ``shorthand`` - The shorthand form of the channel
          ``namespace``. This is usually a string in the format
          ``#channel_name`` if the namespace is of the format
          ``chat:channel_name``. This can differ depending on the type
          of channel the object represents.
        * ``type`` - A string in for format ``<dAmn channel
          'namespace'>`` where ``namespace`` is the same as the object's
          ``namespace`` attribute.
        
        Calling ``str(channel)``, where ``channel`` is an instance of
        the ``Channel`` class, returns the ``namespace`` attribute.
        
        As an example, here is what some of the attributes would look
        like for the **#Botdom** channel when the object is created::
            
            >>> channel = Channel('chat:Botdom', '#Botdom')
            >>> channel.namespace
            'chat:Botdom'
            >>> channel.shorthand
            '#Botdom'
            >>> str(channel)
            'chat:Botdom'
        
        The other attributes would be empty objects of their respective
        types until the appropriate data is received from the server.
