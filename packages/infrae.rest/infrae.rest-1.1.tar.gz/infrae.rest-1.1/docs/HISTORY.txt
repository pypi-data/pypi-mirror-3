Changes
=======

1.1 (2011-11-07)
----------------

* Add support for nested handlers.

* Add support for ``absoluteURL``, in order to get back the URL of an handler.

* Add a default component that is associated with a Grok template. You
  have to trigger the template rendering yourself.

* An event is triggered when a handler is published. If the handlers
  are nested, the event is only triggered for the last one. You can
  see as publisher after traverse event, except you have access to the
  associated handler that is published.

* We now use only the Python native json module (and no longer
  simplejson).

1.0.1 (2010-10-07)
------------------

* Don't define response as a property to be compatible with other Zope views (as a mixin).

1.0 (2010-07-15)
----------------

* Initial release
