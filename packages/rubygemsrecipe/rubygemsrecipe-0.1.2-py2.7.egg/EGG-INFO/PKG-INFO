        environment.
        
        All executable files from gem packages are available in ``bin-directory``.
        
        Usage
        =====

            [buildout]
            parts =
                rubygems
        
            [rubygems]

        Change History
        **************
        
        0.1.2 (2011-11-09)
        ==================
        
        - New version of rubygems includes symlinks in .tgz archyve and extracted by
          setuptools.archive_util extractor ignores all symlinks. This causes missing
          files in extracted folder. Now rubygemsrecipe downloads .zip archyve instead
          of .tgz.
        
        0.1.1 (2011-10-04)
        ==================
        
        - Fixed issue with name of gem executable, which can be different depending on
          how ruby is istalled on host system.
        
        - Install rubygems if gem executable is not found, not rubygems direcotry.
        
        0.1 (2011-09-07)
        ================
        
        - Initial public release.
