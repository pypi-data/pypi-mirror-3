Changes
*******************************************************************************

Release 1.0 (Mar 7, 2012)
===============================================================================

**Improvements**:

  * :meth:`.ANM.buildHessian` method is not using a KDTree by default, since
    with some code optimization the version not using KDTree is running faster.
    Same optimization has gone into :meth:`.GNM.buildKirchhoff` too, but for 
    Kirchoff matrix, version using KDTree is faster and is the default.  Both
    methods have *kdtree* argument to choose whether to use it or not.

  * :program:`prody` script is updated.  Importing Prody and Numpy libraries 
    are avoided. Script responses to help queries faster.  See :ref:`commands`
    for script usage details.

  * Added ``bonded to ...`` selection method that expands a selection to 
    immediately bound atoms.  See :ref:`selections` for its description.
  
  * :func:`~.fetchPDBLigand` parses bond data from the XML file.

  * :func:`~.fetchPDBLigand` can optionally save compressed XML files into
    ProDy package folder so that frequent access to same files will be more
    rapid. See :func:`~.confProDy` function for setting this option.

  * :class:`~.Select` class is revised. All exceptions are handled delicately
    to increase the stability of the class.

  * Distance based atom selection is 10 to 15% faster for atom groups with
    more than 5K atoms.
    
  * Added uncompressed file saving option to :ref:`prody-blast` command.

**Changes**:

  * All deprecated method and functions scheduled for removal are removed.
  
  * :meth:`~.Mode.getEigenvector` and :meth:`~.Mode.getEigenvalue` methods are
    deprecated for removal in v1.1, use :meth:`~.Mode.getEigvec` and 
    :meth:`~.Mode.getEigval` instead.

  * :meth:`~.NMA.getEigenvectors` and :meth:`~.NMA.getEigenvalues` methods are
    deprecated for removal in v1.1, use :meth:`.NMA.getEigvecs` and 
    :meth:`.NMA.getEigvals` instead. 

  * :meth:`.Mode.getCovariance` and :meth:`.ModeSet.getCovariance` methods
    are deprecated for removal in v1.1, use :func:`~.calcCovariance` method 
    instead.

  * :meth:`Mode.getCollectivity` method is removed, use 
    :func:`~.calcCollectivity` function instead.
  
  * :meth:`Mode.getFractOfVariance` method is removed, use the new 
    :func:`~.calcFractVariance` function instead.
  
  * :meth:`Mode.getSqFlucts` method is removed, use :func:`~.calcSqFlucts` 
    function instead.

  * Renamed :func:`showFractOfVar` function as :func:`~.showFractVars` 
    function instead.
    
  * Removed :func:`calcCumOverlapArray`, use :func:`~.calcCumulOverlap`
    with ``array=True`` argument instead.
    
  * Renamed :func:`extrapolateModel` as :func:`~.extendModel`.

  * The relation between :class:`~.AtomGroup`, :class:`~.Trajectory`, and
    :class:`~.Frame` instances have changed. See :ref:`trajectory2` and
    :ref:`outputtraj`, and :ref:`atomsframes` usage examples.
  
  * :class:`~.AtomGroup` cannot be deformed by direct addition with a vector 
    instance.  

  * Unmapped atoms in :class:`~.AtomMap` instances are called dummies.  
    :meth:`AtomMap.numUnmapped` method, for example, is renamed as 
    :meth:`.AtomMap.numDummies`.

  * :func:`~.fetchPDBLigand` accepts only *filename* (instead of *save* and 
    *folder*) argument to save an XML file.

**Bugfix**:

  * A problem in distance based atom selection which would could cause problems
    when a distance based selection is made from a selection is fixed.
    
  * Changed :ref:`prody-blast` so that when a path for downloading files
    are given files are not save to local PDB folder. 
    

Release 0.9.4 (Feb 4, 2012)
===============================================================================

**Changes**:

  * :meth:`setAtomGroup` and :meth:`getAtomGroup` methods are renamed as 
    :meth:`.Ensemble.setAtoms` and  :meth:`.Ensemble.getAtoms`.
    
  * :class:`~.AtomGroup` class trajectory methods, i.e.
    :meth:`~.AtomGroup.setTrajectory`, 
    :meth:`~.AtomGroup.getTrajectory`, 
    :meth:`~.AtomGroup.nextFrame`,
    :meth:`~.AtomGroup.nextFrame`, and 
    :meth:`~.AtomGroup.gotoFrame` 
    methods are deprecated. Version 1.0 will feature a better integration
    of :class:`~.AtomGroup` and :class:`~.Trajectory` classes.


**Bugfix**:

  * Bugfixes in :meth:`~.Bond.setACSIndex`, :func:`~.saveAtoms`,
    and :meth:`~.HierView.getSegment`.
    
  * Bugfixes in :class:`~.GammaVariableCutoff` and 
    :class:`~.GammaStructureBased` classes.

  * Bugfix in :func:`~.calcCrossCorr` function.

  * Bugfixes in :meth:`~.EnsembleBase.getWeights`, 
    :func:`~.showOccupancies`, :meth:`~.DCDFile.flush`.
    
  * Bugfixes in ProDy commands :ref:`prody-blast`, :ref:`prody-fetch`, and
    :ref:`prody-pca`.

  * Bugfix in :func:`~.calcCenter` function.


Release 0.9.3 (Feb 1, 2012)
===============================================================================

**New Features**:

  * :class:`~.DBRef` class is implemented for storing references 
    to sequence databases parsed from PDB header records.
    
  * Methods for storing coordinate set labels in :class:`~.AtomGroup` 
    instances are implemented: :meth:`~.AtomGroup.getACSLabel`, and 
    :meth:`~.AtomGroup.getACSLabel`.

  * :func:`~.calcCenter` and :func:`~.moveAtoms` functions 
    are implemented for dealing with coordinate translation.

  * Hierarchical view, :class:`~.HierView`, is completely redesigned.  
    PDB files that contain non-empty segment name column (or when such 
    information is parsed from a PSF file), new design delicately handles this 
    information to identify distinct chains and residues.  This prevents 
    merging distinct chains in different segments but with same identifiers 
    and residues in those with same numbers.  New design is also using ordered 
    dictionaries :class:`collections.OrderedDict` and lists so that chain and 
    residue iterations yield them in the order they are parsed from file.  
    These improvements also bring modest improvements in speed.

  * :class:`~.Segment` class is implemented for handling segments
    of atoms defined in molecular dynamics simulations setup, using 
    :program:`psfgen` for example. 

  * Context manager methods are added to trajectory classes.  A trajectory
    file can be opened as follows::
       
      with Trajectory('mdm2.dcd') as traj:
          for frame in traj:
              calcGyradius(frame)

  * :class:`~.Chain` slicing is implemented::
    
      p38 = parsePDB('1p38')
      chA = p38['A']
      res_4to10 = chA[4:11]
      res_100toLAST = chA[100:]
  
  * Some support for bonds is implemented to :class:`~.AtomGroup` class.
    Bonds can be set using :meth:`~.AtomGroup.setBonds` method.  All 
    bonds must be set at once.  :meth:`~.AtomGroup.iterBonds` or
    :meth:`~.Atom.iterBonds` methods can be used to iterate over bonds
    in an AtomGroup or an Atom.
      
  * :func:`~.parsePSF` parses bond information and sets to the
    atom group. 

  * :meth:`.Selection.update` method is implemented, which may be useful to 
    update a distance based selection after coordinate changes.  
    
  * :func:`~.buildKDTree` and :func:`~.iterNeighbors` methods
    are implemented for facilitating identification of pairs of atoms that 
    are proximal.  
    
  * :meth:`~.AtomGroup.iterAtoms` method is implemented to all 
    :mod:`~prody.atomic` classes to provide uniformity for atom iterations.
    
  * :meth:`~.calcAngle`, :meth:`~.calcDihedral`, 
    :meth:`~.calcPhi`, :meth:`~.calcPsi`, and 
    :meth:`~.calcOmega` methods are implemented.

**Improvements**:

  * :meth:`~.Chain.getSelstr` methods of :class:`~.Chain` and 
    :class:`~.Residue` classes are improved to include the selection
    string of a :class:`~.Selection` when they are built using one.

**Changes**:

  * :class:`~.Residue` methods :meth:`~.Residue.getNumber`, 
    :meth:`~.Residue.setNumber`, :meth:`~.Residue.getName`,
    :meth:`~.Residue.setName` methods are deprecated and will be 
    removed in v1.0.

  * :class:`~.Chain` methods :meth:`~.Chain.getIdentifier` and 
    :meth:`~.Chain.setIdentifier` methods are deprecated and will be 
    removed in v1.0.

  * :class:`~.Polymer` attribute :attr:`~.Polymer.identifier`
    is renamed as :attr:`~.Polymer.chid`.
  * :class:`~.Chemical` attribute :attr:`~.Chemical.identifier`
    is renamed as :attr:`~.Chemical.resname`.
    
  * :meth:`getACSI` and :meth:`setACSI` are renamed as 
    :meth:`~.AtomGroup.getACSIndex` and  
    :meth:`~.AtomGroup.setACSIndex`, respectively.

  * :func:`calcRadiusOfGyration` is deprecated and will be removed
    in v1.0.  Use :func:`~.calcGyradius` instead.


**Bugfix**:

  * Fixed a problem in :func:`~.parsePDB` that caused loosing existing
    coordinate sets in an :class:`~.AtomGroup` when passed as *ag* 
    argument.
    
  * Fixed a problem with ``"same ... as ..."`` argument of :class:`~.Select`
    that selected atoms when followed by an incorrect atom selection.
    
  * Fixed another problem with ``"same ... as ..."`` which result in selecting
    multiple chains when same chain identifier is found in multiple segments
    or multiple residues when same residue number is found in multiple 
    segments.
    
  * Improved handling of negative integers in indexing :class:`~.AtomGroup` 
    instances.


Release 0.9.2 (Jan 11, 2012)
===============================================================================

**New Features**:

  * :program:`prody catdcd` command is implemented for concatenating and/or 
    slicing :file:`.dcd` files.  See :ref:`prody-catdcd` for usage examples.

  * :class:`~.DCDFile` can be opened in write or append mode, and 
    coordinate sets can be added using :meth:`~.DCDFile.write` method. 
  
  * :class:`~select.getReservedWords` can be used to get a list of words
    that cannot be used to label user data.

  * :class:`~prody.confProDy` function is added for configuring ProDy.
  
  * ProDy can optionally backup existing files with :file:`.BAK` (or another) 
    extension instead of overwriting them.  This behavior can be activated 
    using :class:`~prody.confProDy` function. 
    
**Improvements**:

  * :func:`~.writeDCD` file accepts :class:`~.AtomGroup` or 
    other :class:`~.Atomic` instances as *trajectory* argument.

  * :program:`prody align` command can be used to align multiple PDB structures.
  
  * :program:`prody pca` command allows atom selections for DCD files that are 
    accompanied with a PDB or PSF file.

**Changes**:

  * :class:`~.DCDFile` instances, when closed, raise exception, similar
    to behavior of :class:`file` objects in Python. 
    
  * Title of :class:`~.AtomGroup` instances resulting from copying an 
    :class:`~.Atomic` instances does not start with 'Copy of'.
    
  * :func:`changeVerbosity` and :func:`getVerbosityLevel` are renamed as 
    :func:`~.setVerbosity` and :func:`~.getVerbosity`, respectively. 
    Old names will be removed in v1.0.
    
  * ProDy routines (commands) module is rewritten to use new :mod:`argparse`
    module. See :ref:`commands` for details of changes.
    
  * :mod:`argparse` module is added to the package for Python versions 2.6
    and older.
    

**Bugfix**:

  * Fixed problems in :func:`~.loadAtoms` and :func:`~.saveAtoms`
    functions.

  * Bugfixes in :func:`~.parseDCD` and :func:`~.writeDCD`
    functions for Windows compatability.


Release 0.9.1 (Nov 9, 2011)
===============================================================================

**Bug Fixes**:

  * Fixed problems with reading and writing configuration files.
  * Fixed problem with importing nose for testing.

Release 0.9 (Nov 8, 2011)
===============================================================================

**New Features**:

  * `PDBML <http://pdbml.pdb.org/>`_ and `mmCIF <http://mmcif.pdb.org/>`_ files
    can be retrieved using :func:`~.fetchPDB` function.

  * :func:`~.getPDBLocalFolder` and :func:`~.setPDBLocalFolder`
    functions are implemented for local PDB folder management.
    
  * :func:`~.parsePDBHeader` is implemented for convenient parsing of
    header data from :file:`.pdb` files.
    
  * :func:`~.showProtein` is implemented to allow taking a quick look
    at protein structure.

  * :class:`~.Chemical` and :class:`~.Polymer` classes are 
    implemented for storing chemical and polymer component data parsed from
    PDB header records.


**Changes**:

  .. warning::  This release introduces numerous changes in method and function
     names all aiming to improve the interactive usage experience.  All changes
     are listed below.  Currently these functions and methods are present in
     both old and new names, so code using ProDy must not be affected.  Old
     function names will be removed from version 1.0, which is expected to 
     happen late in the first quarter of 2012.
      
     Old function names are marked as deprecated, but ProDy will not issue any
     warnings until the end of 2011.  In 2012, ProDy will will automatically 
     start issuing :class:`DeprecationWarning` upon calls using old names to 
     remind the user of the name change.  
     
     For deprecated methods that are present in multiple classes, only the 
     affected modules are listed for brevity.
     
  .. note::  When modifying code using ProDy to adjust the name changes, 
     turning on deprecation warnings may help locating all use cases of the 
     deprecated names.  See :meth:`~.turnonDepracationWarnings` for this
     purpose.

  **Functions**:
  
  The following function name changes are mainly to reduce the length of the 
  name in order to make them more suitable for interactive sessions:

  ========================================  =====================================
  Old name                                  New name

  :func:`getPairwiseGapExtensionPenalty`    :func:`~.getGapExtPenalty`
  :func:`setPairwiseGapExtensionPenalty`    :func:`~.setGapExtPenalty`
  ========================================  =====================================

  **Coordinate methods**:
  
  All :meth:`getCoordinates` and :meth:`setCoordinates` methods in 
  :mod:`~prody.atomic` and :mod:`~prody.ensemble` classes are renamed as 
  :meth:`getCoords` and :meth:`setCoords`, respectively.
  
  ``getNumOf`` **methods**:
  
  All method names starting with ``getNumOf`` now start with ``num``.  This
  change brings two advantages: method names (i) are considerably shorter, 
  and (ii) do not suggest that there might also be corresponding ``set``
  methods. 
  
  ============================  ====================  =========================
  Old name                      New name              Affected modules
  ============================  ====================  =========================
  :meth:`getNumOfAtoms`         :meth:`numAtoms`      :mod:`~prody.atomic`, 
                                                      :mod:`~prody.ensemble`, 
                                                      :mod:`~prody.dynamics`
  :meth:`getNumOfChains`        :meth:`numChains`     :mod:`~prody.atomic`

  :meth:`getNumOfUnmapped`      :meth:`numUnmapped`   :mod:`~prody.atomic`
  ============================  ====================  =========================
    
  ``getName`` **method**:
  
  :meth:`getName` methods are renamed as :meth:`getTitle` to avoid confusions 
  that might arise from changes in :mod:`~prody.atomic` method names listed 
  below.  All classes in :mod:`~prody.atomic`, :mod:`~prody.ensemble`, and 
  :mod:`~prody.dynamics` are affected from this change. 
  
  In line with this change, :func:`~.parsePDB` and 
  :func:`~.parsePQR` *name* arguments are changed to *title*, but 
  *name* argument will also work until release 1.0.
  
  This name change conflicted with :meth:`getTitle` method of :class:`~
  .DCDFile`.  The conflict is resolved in favor of the general :meth:`getTitle`
  method.  An alternative method will be implemented to handle title strings 
  in :file:`DCD` files.   
  
  ``get/set`` **methods of atomic classes**:
  
  Names of ``get`` and ``set`` methods allowing access to atomic data are all
  shortened as follows:
  
  ===========================  =======================
  Old name                     New name
  ===========================  =======================
  :meth:`getAtomNames`	       :meth:`getNames`
  :meth:`getAtomTypes`	       :meth:`getTypes`
  :meth:`getAltLocIndicators`  :meth:`getAltlocs`
  :meth:`getAnisoTempFactors`  :meth:`getAnisos`
  :meth:`getAnisoStdDevs`      :meth:`getAnistds`
  :meth:`getChainIdentifiers`  :meth:`getChains`
  :meth:`getElementSymbols`    :meth:`getElements`
  :meth:`getHeteroFlags`       :meth:`getHeteros`
  :meth:`getInsertionCodes`    :meth:`getIcodes`
  :meth:`getResidueNames`      :meth:`getResnames`
  :meth:`getResidueNumbers`    :meth:`getResnums`
  :meth:`getSecondaryStrs`     :meth:`getSecstrs`            
  :meth:`getSegmentNames`      :meth:`getSegnames`
  :meth:`getSerialNumbers`     :meth:`getSerials`
  :meth:`getTempFactors`	   :meth:`getBetas`
  ===========================  =======================
                       
  This change affects all :mod:`~prody.atomic` classes, 
  :class:`~.AtomGroup`, :class:`~.Atom`, :class:`~.Chain`, 
  :class:`~.Residue`, :class:`~.Selection` and 
  :class:`~.AtomMap`.     


  **Other changes in atomic methods**:
  
  * :meth:`getSelectionString` renamed as :meth:`getSelstr`

  Methods handling user data (which was previously called attribute) are 
  renamed as follows: 

  ====================  =======================
  Old name              New name
  ====================  =======================
  :meth:`getAttribute`  :meth:`getData`
  :meth:`getAttrNames`  :meth:`getDataLabels`
  :meth:`getAttrType`   :meth:`getDataType`
  :meth:`delAttribute`  :meth:`delData`
  :meth:`isAttribute`	:meth:`isData`
  :meth:`setAttribute`  :meth:`setData`
  ====================  =======================
  
  **To be removed**:
  
  Finally, the following methods will be removed, but other suitable methods
  are overloaded to perform their action:
  
  * removed :meth:`AtomGroup.getBySerialRange`, overloaded 
    :meth:`.AtomGroup.getBySerial`
  * removed :func:`~.getProteinResidueNames`, overloaded
    :func:`~select.getKeywordResnames` 
  * removed :func:`~.setProteinResidueNames`, overloaded
    :func:`~select.setKeywordResnames` 


**Scripts**:
  
  The way ProDy scripts work has changed. See :ref:`commands` for details.
  Using older scripts will start issuing deprecation warnings in 2012.

**Bug Fixes**:

  * Bugs in :func:`~.execDSSP` and :func:`~.execSTRIDE`
    functions that caused exceptions when compressed files were passed 
    is fixed.
  
  * A problem in scripts for PCA of DCD files is fixed. 
    
  
:ref:`nmwiz`
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Development of NMWiz is finalized and it will not be distributed in the ProDy
installation package anymore.  See :ref:`nmwiz` pages for instructions on
installing it. 


Release 0.8.3 (Oct 16, 2011)
===============================================================================

**New Features**:

  * Functions to read and write PQR files: :func:`~.parsePQR` and
    :func:`~.writePQR`.
    
  * Added :meth:`~.PDBEnsemble.getIdentifiers` method that returns
    identifiers of all conformations in the ensemble. 

  * ProDy tests are incorporated to the package installer.  If you are using 
    Python version 2.7, you can run the tests by calling ``prody.test()``.


**Improvements**:

  * :func:`~.blastPDB` function and :class:`~.PDBBlastRecord`
    class are rewritten to use faster and more compact code.
    
  * New :class:`PackageLogger` function is implemented to unify logging
    and reporting task progression.
  
  * Improvements in PDB ensemble support functions, e.g. 
    :func:`~.trimPDBEnsemble`, are made.
   
  * Improvements in ensemble concatenations are made.

**Bug Fixes**:

  * Bugfixes in :func:`~.PDBEnsemble` slicing operation.  This may
    have affected users when slicing a PDB ensemble for plotting projections
    in color for different forms of the protein.
    
Release 0.8.2 (Oct 14, 2011)
===============================================================================

**New Features**:

  * :func:`~.fetchPDBClusters`, :func:`~.loadPDBClusters`, and
    :func:`~.getPDBCluster` functions are implemented for handling
    PDB sequence cluster data. These functions can be used instead of 
    :func:`~.blastPDB` function for fast access to structures of 
    the same protein (at 95% sequence identity level) or similar proteins.
    
  * Perturbation response scanning method described in [CA09]_ is implemented 
    as :func:`~.scanPerturbationResponse` based on the code provided 
    by Ying Liu.
  

**Changes**:

  * :func:`~.fetchLigandData` returns the URL of the XML file in the
    ligand data dictionary.
    
  * Name of the ProDy configuration file in user :file:`home` directory 
    is renamed as :file:`.prodyrc` (used to be :file:`.prody`).

Release 0.6 (Feb 22, 2011)
===============================================================================

**New Features**:

  * Biopython module pairwise2 and packages KDTree and Blast are incorporated
    in ProDy package to make installation easier. Only NumPy needs to be 
    installed before ProDy can be used. For plotting, Matplotlib is still 
    required.
  * :ref:`nmwiz` is distributed with ProDy source. On Linux, if VMD is 
    installed, ProDy installer locates VMD plugins folder and installs NMWiz.
    On Windows, user needs to follow a separate set of instructions (see
    :ref:`nmwiz`).
  * :class:`~.Gamma` class is implemented for facilitating use of  
    force constants based on atom type, residue type, or property. An
    example derived classes are :class:`~.GammaStructureBased` and

    classes are improved to accept :class:`~.Gamma` instances
    or other custom function as *gamma* argument. See also :ref:`gamma`.
  * :class:`~select.Select` class is changed to treat single word keywords
    differently, e.g. "backbone" or "protein". 
    They are interpreted 10 times faster and in use achieve much higher 
    speed-ups when compared to composite selections. For example, using the 
    keyword "calpha" instead of the ``name CA and protein``,
    which returns the same selection, works >20 times faster. 
  * Optimizations in :class:`~select.Select` class to increase 
    performance (Thanks to Paul McGuire for providing several Pythonic tips
    and Pyparsing specific advice).
  * :func:`~.applyBiomolecularTransformations` function is improved
    to handle large biomolecular assemblies.
  * Performance optimizations in :func:`~.parsePDB` and other 
    functions.

  * :class:`~.NMABase` instances can be index using a list or tuple of 
    integers, e.g. ``anm[1,3,5]``.
  * "ca", "bb", and "sc" keywords are defined as short-hands 
    for "calpha", "backbone", and "sidechain", respectively.
  * Behavior of :func:`~.calcANM` and :func:`~.calcGNM` 
    functions have changed. They return the atoms used for calculation as well.

**Bug Fixes**:
    
  * A bug in :func:`~.assignSecondaryStructure` function is fixed.
  * Bug fixes in :ref:`prody-anm` and :ref:`prody-gnm`.

    calculations can be performed for molecules that are loaded in VMD.
  * User can set default color for arrow graphics and paths to
    ANM and PCA scripts.
  * Optionally, NMWiz can preserve the current view in VMD display window when
    loading a new dataset. Check the box in the NMWiz GUI main window.
  * A bug that prevented selecting residues from plot window is fixed.

Release 0.5.3 (Feb 11, 2011)

    implemented as :func:`~.calcCovOverlap` function.
  * A method to trim :class:`~.Ensemble` instances is implemented: 
    :func:`~.trimEnsemble`
  * :func:`checkUpdates` to check for ProDy updates is implemented.

**Changes**:

  * Change in default behavior of :func:`~.parsePDB` function. When
    alternate locations exist, those indicated by A are parsed. For parsing
    all alternate locations user needs to pass ``altloc=True`` argument.    
  * :func:`getSumOfWeights` is renamed as :func:`~.calcSumOfWeights`.
  * :func:`mapAtomsToChain` is renamed as :func:`~.mapOntoChain`.
  * :func:`ProDyStartLogFile` is renamed as :func:`startLogfile`.

**Improvements**:
  
  * Improvements in :meth:`.ANM.calcModes`, :meth:`.GNM.calcModes`, 
    and :meth:`.PCA.calcModes` methods prevent Numpy/Scipy throwing an
    exception when more than available modes are requested by the user.
  * Improvements in :func:`.blastPDB` enable ProDy throw an 
    exception when no internet connection is found, and warn user when
    downloads fail due to restriction in network regulations (Thanks to Serkan
    Apaydin for helping identify these improvements).
  * New example :ref:`writepdb`.

Release 0.5.1 (Dec 31, 2010)
===============================================================================

**Changes in dependencies**:

* Scipy (linear algebra module) is not required package anymore. 
  When available it replaces Numpy (linear algebra module) for greater flexibility
  and efficiency. A warning message is printed when Scipy is not found.
* Biopython KDTree module is not required for ENM calculations (specifically
  for building Hessian (ANM) or Kirchoff (GNM) matrices). When available it 
  is used to increase the performance. A warning message is printed when 
  KDTree is not found.

Release 0.5 (Dec 21, 2010)
===============================================================================

**New Features**:

  * :class:`~.AtomPointer` base class for classes pointing to
    atoms in an :class:`~.AtomGroup`.

    coordinate sets of an :class:`~.AtomGroup` instance.

**Bug Fixes**:

  * A bug in :func:`.parsePDBStream` that caused unidentified errors 
    when a model in a multiple model file did not have the same number of 
    atoms is fixed.

**Changes**:

  * Iterating over a :class:`~.Chain` instance yields :class:`~.Residue` 
    instances.
  * :class:`~.Vector` instantiation requires an *array* only. *name* 
    is an optional argument.
  * Functions starting with ``get`` and performing a calculations are renamed to
    start with ``calc``, e.g. :func:`getRMSD` is renamed to
    :func:`~.calcRMSD`

Release 0.2 (Nov 16, 2010)
===============================================================================

**Important Changes**:


  * Single word keywords *not* followed by "and" logical operator are not 
    accepted, e.g. "protein within 5 of water" will raise an SelectionError, 
    use "protein and within 5 of water" instead.

**Improvements**:

  * :mod:`~.proteins.compare` functions are improved. Now they perform sequence
    alignment if simple residue number/identity based matchin does not work,
    or if user passes ``pwalign=True`` argument. This impacts the speed 
    of X-ray ensemble analysis.
  * :class:`~.Select` can cache data optionally. This results
    in speeds up from 2 to 50 folds depending on number of atoms and selection
    operations.
  * Implementation of :func:`~.showProjection` is completed.
