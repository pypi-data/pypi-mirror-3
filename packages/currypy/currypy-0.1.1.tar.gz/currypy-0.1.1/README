functools.partial allows for the currying of arguments. However, being implemented in C, functools.partial objects are not pickleable. This package implements a wrapper class for the partial objects, such that enables pickling of the objects.

It requires the following:
* functools
* subsequently, Python 2.5

Once installed (see INSTALL for instructions), your Python application can use currypy as follows.

First, import the module:
        import currypy

Usage is the same as the currypy.Curry API.  See src/test/TestCurry for examples of usage
