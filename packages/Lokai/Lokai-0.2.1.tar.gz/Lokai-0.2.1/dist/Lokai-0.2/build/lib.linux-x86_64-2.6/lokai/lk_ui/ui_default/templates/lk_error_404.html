<div class="lk_error_page">
<h1>Page not Found</h1>
<p>I'm sorry, I cannot display the page you asked for.</p>

<p>This could be because the page doesn't exist, or perhaps you don't have access to it.</p>
{% if link_from_self %}
<p>As it happens, you seem to have reached here by one of my links. That must be my fault, sorry. I have reported the problem, so we should be able to fix it.</p>
{% endif %}
{% if request.user %} 
<p>I see you are already logged in, so that's alright. If you think the page exists and you <em>should</em> have access to it, please let us know.</p>
{% else %}
<p>You are not logged in, so perhaps that is the problem? Please go back to the home page, log in, and try again. If you are not a registered user we would be very happy to talk to  you about the site and get you registered.</p>
{% endif %}

<p>You can return to the <a href="{{ request.host_url }}">home page</a> to find the page you want.</p>
