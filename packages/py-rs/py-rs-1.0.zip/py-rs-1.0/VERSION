py-rs version numbering
=======================

Stable py-rs versions are numbered A.B.C or A.B.

  - A is the release version number - it is only incremented for concept
    changes in the framework.

  - B is the feature set number - means the more features are available in
    greater B version than in previous one. Increasing B version MAY NOT
    guarantee backward compatibility.

  - C is the bug fixing number - means there some bugs were fixed in B version.
    Increasing C version MUST guarantee backward compatibility, otherwise the
    fix SHOULD be included in upcoming B version.

B version has own C numbering.

Initial version of B MAY omit C number.

Non-stable py-rs versions SHOULD include special build attribute after Stable
version number.

  - Nightly build version SHOULD be numbered as A[.B[.C]]-[rev] where [rev] is
    SVN revision attribute e.g 1.0-255

  - Beta build version SHOULD provide beta suffix with beta number as
    A[.B[.C]][b{beta number}] e.g. 1.0b1.

  - Release candidate build version SHOULD provide rc suffix with rc number as
    A[.B[.C]][rc{rc number}] e.g. 1.0rc1.
