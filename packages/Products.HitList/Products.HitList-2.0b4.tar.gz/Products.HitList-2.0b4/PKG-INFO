Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        Products.HitList provides a simple hit-list functionality for Plone. Users may
        add objects of specific content types to their HitList and remove them if no
        longer needed. The current hit-list of a user may be displayed in a portlet or
        on a specific view.
        
        
        Integration
        ===========
        
        By default the hit-list behavior is not activated for any content type. The
        functionality is bound to a marker interface::
        
            Products.HitList.interfaces.IHitListContent
        
        Objects implementing this interface may be added to the hit-list. Activate the
        behavior for existing content types may be done by subclassing or preferable
        by using the five:implements directive in zcml.
        
        
        Example
        =======
        
        By using the following zcml directive the hit-list functionality is activated for
        Documents::
        
            <configure
                xmlns="http://namespaces.zope.org/zope"
                xmlns:five="http://namespaces.zope.org/five">
              
                <five:implements
                    class="Products.ATContentTypes.content.document.ATDocument"
                    interface="Products.HitList.interfaces.IHitListContent"
                    />
            
            </configure>
