Description
-----------

Users identify, who interacts with the system. Information about them is stored
in **couchDB** as a JSON document. By using the administration form, you can
let the server create the document for you.

A full example user document can be seen in the user.json_
file. Every user has its own document. Some fields in the document
are generated by the server. They are described in the appropriate module.

Form fields

The fields in the **user** form are:
  - **Name** - User's name. It can contain any characters. (mandatory)
  - **Password** - User's initial password. He can change it after he logs in.

  - **Permissions** - List of groups the user belongs to. Every user should
    have be in the *all* group.
  - **Allowed** - If the user can log in. If false, he is not allowed to do so.
