CoreJet Visualisation
=====================

This package contains a skeleton for generating a graphical CoreJet report
from a CoreJet XML file using XSLT.

Call ``corejet.visualization.generateReportFromCatalogue()`` with an
``IRequirementsCatalogue`` as the first argument and a target directory name
as the second argument to put a report in that directory.
