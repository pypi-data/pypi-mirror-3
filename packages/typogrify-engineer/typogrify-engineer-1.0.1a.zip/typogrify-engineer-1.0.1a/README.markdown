Note: This is a fork of [a fork](hyde) of the original `typogrify` 
project made especially for [Engineer][]. The modifications are very 
minor, so you should look at the [documentation](hyde) for the hyde 
fork to get a sense of what it does.

Modifications:

- SmartyPants defaults changed so that `--` is interpreted as an en-dash 
and `---` is interpreted as an em-dash. I don't know why in the world this 
isn't the default.
