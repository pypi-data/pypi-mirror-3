Version 0.1.0:
 Major changes:
   1.  Changed standard transfer matrix alg. to S-matrix alg.
       The solution should now be numerically stable in presence 
       of large absorption.
   2.  Rewrote openTMMpreprint.pdf.  It now includes a discussion
       of different transfer matrix algorithms and performance
       comparison of python to Fortran 90/95 as well as numerical
       stability tests.

 Minor Changes:
   1.  Removed the test module (openTMM/tests/).
   2.  Simplified calculations of FIM and FIMvsDist.
   3.  Updated code and header comments.
