Pivotal API client library
==========================

Simple example
--------------

If you don't have a token, get one using username and password (or
just pass it directly):

  >>> client = PivotalClient(token=None, cache='path/to/cache')
  >>> token = client.token.active('username', 'password')['token']['guid']

  >>> client.token = token

Get some projects:

  >>> projects = client.projects.all()['projects']

Get current stories for a project:

  >>> iterations = client.iterations.current(projects[0]['id'])

  >>> storries_in_current_iteration = iterations[0]['iteration']['stories']

This should probably be client.projects.iterations.current(), but using
flat structure at the moment.
