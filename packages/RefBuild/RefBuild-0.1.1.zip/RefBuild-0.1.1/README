RefBuilder
==========

RefBuilder is a script that builds reStructuredText files from the docstrings
of a project's Python source files and prepares them for compilation with Sphinx.

To use, navigate to the folder containing the source files to read from. Open a
command line at this directory and execute the command:

$ refbuilder

You will be prompted to give the output folder. If your project directory is::

  /packageroot
      /doc
          /source
              index.rst
      /src
          main.py
          othersource.py

you should execute refbuilder from the ``src`` directory and type ``../doc/source``
for the source of the output folder. Afterwards, you will have the following files::

  /packageroot
      /doc
          /source
              api.rst
              index.rst
              main.py
              othersource.py
      /src
          main.py
          othersource.py
