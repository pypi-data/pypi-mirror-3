Slideshow Screensaver v0.2
##########################

Introduction
############

Slideshow Screensaver is a screensaver which displays a new photo every 10 
seconds from ``$HOME/Pictures``.  If you want to customize the photo directory, 
the time between photos or the screensaver delay you will need to edit the 
source code for now.

This is a very simple app which, for now, might not play nicely with
xscreensaver, gnome-screensaver, etc.

Installation
############

1. Install the system-wide dependencies:

	- python 2.7
	- xautolock
	
2. Install the python package: ::

	sudo pip install slideshow-screensaver
	
3. Configure the screensaver to run automatically:

	- Disable any other screensavers.
	- Make ``slidesaver-daemon`` run at startup.
