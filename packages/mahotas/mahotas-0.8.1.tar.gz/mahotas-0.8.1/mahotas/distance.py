def distance(bw, metric='euclidean2'):
    '''
    dmap = distance(bw, metric='euclidean2')

    Computes the distance transform of image `bw`::

        dmap[i,j] = min_{i', j'} { (i-i')**2 + (j-j')**2 | bw[i', j'] }

    Parameters
    ----------
    bw : 2d-ndarray
        Black & White image
    metric : str, optional
        one of 'euclidean2' (default) or 'euclidean'

    Returns
    -------
    dmap : ndarray
        distance map
