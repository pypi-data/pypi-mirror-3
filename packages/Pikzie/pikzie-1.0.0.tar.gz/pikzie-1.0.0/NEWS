The history of Pikzie

1.0.0: 2011-12-18
=================

Our repository has been moved to "GitHub
<https://github.com/clear-code/pikzie>"_ from sourceforge.net.

Improvements
------------

  * Supported subprocess. [Improved by Tetsuya Morimoto]
  * Supported Python 3.2.
  * Dropped Python 2.5 or earlier support.
  * Changed an abbreviation character for ``re.DOTALL`` to
    ``s`` instead of ``d`` because ``re.S`` means ``re.DOTALL``.
  * Supported regular expression flags in ``--name`` and
    ``--test-case``. ``/.../FLAGS`` format is
    used. ``/.../i`` means case insensitive match.

Fixes
-----

  * Fixed a problem that the same test files are loaded twice.
    [Fixed by Hideo Hattori]
  * Fixed a problem that test data output is failed when
    data driven test is failed.
    [pizke-users-ja:22] [Fixed by Tetsuya Morimoto]
