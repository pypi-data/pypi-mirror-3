How to make a release:

- Double-check that readme includes historical changes.
- Use Mercurial to tag the released version.
- Run release-package (from jaraco.util) in the current directory. This uploads to pypi.
- upload released packages to sourceforge (can we automate this)?
- announce release on python-announce-list@python.org
- bump the version in setup.py and commit
