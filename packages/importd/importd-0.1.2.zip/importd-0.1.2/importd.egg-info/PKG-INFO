Description: What is it?
        ===========
        
        Django is awesome, but starting a new project in it is a pain. amitu.d is
        inspired from ruby's sinatra. Hello world django project:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
         from importd import d
         d(DEBUG=True)
        
         @d("/")
         def idx(request):
            return "index.html" 
        
         @d("/post/<int:post_id">/")
         def post(request, post_id):
            return "post.html", {"post_id": post_id}
        
        To run it:
        
        .. code::
        
          $ python foo.py
        
        This will start the debug server. 
        
        To run it in production:
        
        .. code::
        
          $ gunicorn foo:d
        
        An example app: https://github.com/amitu/importd/blob/master/foo.py
