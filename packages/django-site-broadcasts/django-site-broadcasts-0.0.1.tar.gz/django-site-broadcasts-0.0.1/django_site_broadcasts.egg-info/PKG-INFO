Description: ======================
        django-site-broadcasts
        ======================
        
        The site broadcast application allows users to define short messages and
        announcements that should be displayed across a site.
        
        Each broadcast message consists of a short message, an optional start time, and
        a completion time, when the 
        
        should be displayed across a site
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Clone the repository and use the ``setup.py`` file to install the application.
        
            python setup.py install
        
        Then add ``broadcasts`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` and
        ``broadcasts.context_processors.broadcast_message`` to
        ``TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS``.
        
        Usage
        =====

        ::
        
            {{ broadcast_message }}
        
        TO-DO
