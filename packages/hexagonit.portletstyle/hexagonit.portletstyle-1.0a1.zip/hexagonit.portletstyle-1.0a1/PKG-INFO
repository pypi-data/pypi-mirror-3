Description: ===============================
        Assign a CSS style to a portlet
        ===============================
        
        `hexagonit.portletstyle` is a Plone 4.x add-on that allows you to assign a CSS
        style to a portlet. You can chose from a list of pre-defined (configurable
        through Plone Control Panel) classes.

        * `Releases @ PyPI <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/hexagonit.portletstyle>`_

        Installation
        ============
        
        To install ``hexagonit.portletstyle`` you simply add
        ``hexagonit.portletstyle`` to the list of eggs in your buildout, run
        buildout and restart Plone. Then, install `hexagonit.portletstyle` using the
        Add-ons control panel.
        
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Click on ``Manage portlets`` and add or edit a portlet. Select your desired
        portlet style from the `Portlet Style` drop-down menu and save. That's it.
        
        
        Default portlet styles
        ======================
        
        By default, this package gives you three default portlet styles:
        
        * ``noheader``
        * ``nofooter``
        * ``noheader nofooter``
        
        
        Managing available portlet styles
        =================================
        
        You can add, edit and remove available portlet styles by going to the `Plone
        Control Panel` and clicking on the ``Portlet Styles`` configlet. Pointing your
        browser directly to ``http://<zope_ip>:<zope_port>/<plone_id>/@@portletstyles``
        also does the trick.
        
        
        Supported portlets
        ==================
        
        As of this moment, the following portlets are supported (as in, you can select
        a style when editing them):
        
        * `Events portlet`
        * `Navigation portlet`
        * `News portlet`
        * `Recently changed items portlet`
        * `RSS portlet`
        * `Collection portlet`
        * `Static text portlet`
        
        The rest of out-of-the-box Plone portlets are non-editable ones as you normally
        need only one instance per site. For these (and other) reasons the following
        portlets *do not support* choosing a style for them:
        
        * `Calendar portlet`
        * `Classic portlet`
        * `Language portlet`
        * `Login portlet`
        * `Review portlet`
        * `Search portlet`
        
        
        Styling third-party portlets
        ============================
        
        Follow the steps below to convince your third-party portlets to support
        selecting a style for them.
        
        Portlet Assignment
        ------------------
        
        You portlet's ``Assignment`` class must have an ``__init__()`` and inside this method
        it must call base assignment's ``__init__()``. To put it in other words,
        ``plone.app.portlets.portlets.base.Assignment`` (from which you portlet's 
        ``Assignment`` is likely inheriting from) has an ``__init__()`` method that sets
        the ``self.portlet_style`` value. You need to call this ``__init__()`` from your
        portlet's assignment's ``__init__()``.
        
        An example of how this can be achieved:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from plone.app.portlets.portlets import base
            class Assignment(base.Assignment):
                implements(IMyCustomPortlet)
        
                def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
                    base.Assignment.__init__(self, *args, **kwargs)
                    self.foo = kwargs.get('foo', 5)
                    self.bar = kwargs.get('bar', "bar")
        
        Portlet AddForm
        ---------------
        
        Each portlet also has an ``AddForm`` class with a ``create`` method. This method
        must also pass the portlet style as a parameter. To make things simpler, just
        pass in the entire ``data``.
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            class AddForm(base.AddForm):
                form_fields = form.Fields(IMyCustomPortlet)
        
                def create(self, data):
                    return Assignment(**data)
        
        Template
        --------
        
        Use the style in the template to assign an additional CSS class to your portlet:
        
        .. code-block:: html
        
            <dl class="portlet portletMyCustom"
                tal:attributes="class string:portlet portletMyCustom ${view/portlet_style}"
                i18n:domain="plone">
        TODO
        ====
        
        * translations
        * use in the wild
        * better @@portletstyles control panel configlet UI: key (CSS class) - value
          (title) type records
        * patch non-editable portlets (login, calendar, search, etc.)
