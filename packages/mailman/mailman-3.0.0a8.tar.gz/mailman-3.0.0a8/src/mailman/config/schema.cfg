# These variables control the format and frequency of VERP-like delivery for
# better bounce detection.  VERP is Variable Envelope Return Path, defined
# here:
#
# http://cr.yp.to/proto/verp.txt
#
# This involves encoding the address of the recipient as Mailman knows it into
# the envelope sender address (i.e. RFC 5321 MAIL FROM).  Thus, no matter what
# kind of forwarding the recipient has in place, should it eventually bounce,
# we will receive an unambiguous notice of the bouncing address.
#
# However, we're technically only "VERP-like" because we're doing the envelope
# sender encoding in Mailman, not in the MTA.  We do require cooperation from
# the MTA, so you must be sure your MTA can be configured for extended address
# semantics.
#
# The first variable describes how to encode VERP envelopes.  It must contain
# these three string interpolations, which get filled in by Mailman:
#
# $bounces -- the list's -bounces robot address will be set here
# $local   -- the recipient address's local mailbox part will be set here
# $domain  -- the recipient address's domain name will be set here
#
# This example uses the default below.
#
# FQDN list address is: mylist@dom.ain
# Recipient is:         aperson@a.nother.dom
#
# The envelope sender will be mylist-bounces+aperson=a.nother.dom@dom.ain
#
# Note that your MTA /must/ be configured to deliver such an addressed message
# to mylist-bounces!
verp_delimiter: +
verp_format: ${bounces}+${local}=${domain}

# For nicer confirmation emails, use a VERP-like format which encodes the
# confirmation cookie in the reply address.  This lets us put a more user
# friendly Subject: on the message, but requires cooperation from the MTA.
# Format is like verp_format, but with the following substitutions:
#
# $address  -- the list-confirm address
# $cookie   -- the confirmation cookie
verp_confirm_format: $address+$cookie

# This regular expression unambiguously decodes VERP addresses, which will be
# placed in the To: (or other, depending on the MTA) header of the bounce
# message by the bouncing MTA.  Getting this right is critical -- and tricky.
# Learn your Python regular expressions.  It must define exactly three named
# groups, `bounces`, `local` and `domain`, with the same definition as above.
# It will be compiled case-insensitively.
verp_regexp: ^(?P<bounces>[^+]+?)\+(?P<local>[^=]+)=(?P<domain>[^@]+)@.*$

# This is analogous to verp_regexp, but for splitting apart the
# verp_confirm_format.  MUAs have been observed that mung
#
# From: local_part@host
#
# into
#
# To: "local_part" <local_part@host>
#
# when replying, so we skip everything up to '<' if any.
verp_confirm_regexp: ^(.*<)?(?P<addr>[^+]+?)\+(?P<cookie>[^@]+)@.*$

# Set this to 'yes' to enable VERP-like (more user friendly) confirmations.
verp_confirmations: no

# Another good opportunity is when regular delivery is personalized.  Here
# again, we're already incurring the performance hit for addressing each
# individual recipient.  Set this to 'yes' to enable VERPs on all personalized
# regular deliveries (personalized digests aren't supported yet).
verp_personalized_deliveries: no

# And finally, we can VERP normal, non-personalized deliveries.  However,
# because it can be a significant performance hit, we allow you to decide how
# often to VERP regular deliveries.  This is the interval, in number of
# messages, to do a VERP recipient address.  The same variable controls both
# regular and digest deliveries.  Set to 0 to disable occasional VERPs, set to
# 1 to VERP every delivery, or to some number > 1 for only occasional VERPs.
verp_delivery_interval: 0

# VERP format and regexp for probe messages.
verp_probe_format: $bounces+$token@$domain
verp_probe_regexp: ^(?P<bounces>[^+]+?)\+(?P<token>[^@]+)@.*$
# Set this 'yes' to activate VERP probe for disabling by bounce.
verp_probes: no

# This is the maximum number of automatic responses sent to an address because
# of -request messages or posting hold messages.  This limit prevents response
# loops between Mailman and misconfigured remote email robots.  Mailman
# already inhibits automatic replies to any message labeled with a header
# "Precendence: bulk|list|junk".  This is a fallback safety valve so it should
# be set fairly high.  Set to 0 for no limit (probably useful only for
# debugging).
max_autoresponses_per_day: 10

# Some list posts and mail to the -owner address may contain DomainKey or
# DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) signature headers <http://www.dkim.org/>.
# Various list transformations to the message such as adding a list header or

# signatures.  It is generally felt that these signatures have value, even if
# broken and even if the outgoing message is resigned.  However, some sites
# may wish to remove these headers by setting this to 'yes'.
remove_dkim_headers: no

archive_scrubber: mailman.archiving.pipermail.Pipermail

# This variable defines what happens to text/html subparts.  They can be
# stripped completely, escaped, or filtered through an external program.  The
# legal values are:
# 0 - Strip out text/html parts completely, leaving a notice of the removal in
#     the message.  If the outer part is text/html, the entire message is
#     discarded.
# 1 - Remove any embedded text/html parts, leaving them as HTML-escaped
#     attachments which can be separately viewed.  Outer text/html parts are
#     simply HTML-escaped.
# 2 - Leave it inline, but HTML-escape it
# 3 - Remove text/html as attachments but don't HTML-escape them. Note: this
#     is very dangerous because it essentially means anybody can send an HTML
#     email to your site containing evil JavaScript or web bugs, or other
#     nasty things, and folks viewing your archives will be susceptible.  You
#     should only consider this option if you do heavy moderation of your list
#     postings.
#
# Note: given the current archiving code, it is not possible to leave
# text/html parts inline and un-escaped.  I wouldn't think it'd be a good idea
# to do anyway.
#
# The value can also be a string, in which case it is the name of a command to
# filter the HTML page through.  The resulting output is left in an attachment
# or as the entirety of the message when the outer part is text/html.  The
# format of the string must include a $filename substitution variable which
# will contain the name of the temporary file that the program should operate
# on.  It should write the processed message to stdout.  Set this to
# HTML_TO_PLAIN_TEXT_COMMAND to specify an HTML to plain text conversion
# program.
archive_html_sanitizer: 1
