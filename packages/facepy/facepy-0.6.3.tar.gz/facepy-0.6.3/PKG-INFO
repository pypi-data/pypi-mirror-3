        About
        -----
        
        Facepy makes it absurdly easy to interact with Facebook APIs.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        ::
        
            from facepy import GraphAPI
        
            # Initialize the Graph API with a valid access token (optional,
            # but will allow you to do all sorts of fun stuff).
            graph = GraphAPI(oauth_access_token)
        
            # Get my latest posts
            graph.get('me/posts')
        
            # Post a photo of a parrot
            graph.post(
                path = 'me/photos',
                source = open('parrot.jpg')
            )
        
        Facepy can do more than reading your latest posts and posting photographs of parrots, but you'll have to
        `read the documentation <http://readthedocs.org/docs/facepy>`_ to find out how.
