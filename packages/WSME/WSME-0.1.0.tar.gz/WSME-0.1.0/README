WSME
====

Web Service Made Easy (WSME) is a very easy way to implement webservices
in your python web application. It is originally a rewrite of TGWebServices
with focus on extensibility and framework-independance.

Main features are:

-   Very simple API
-   Supports user defined complex types.
-   Multi-protocol : REST+Json, REST+XML, SOAP, and more to come
-   Extensible : easy to add more protocols or more base types.
-   WSGI application : can be used within any web framework
-   Depends on webob, simplegeneric (+ Genshi if you use SOAP)
-   Integration in Sphinx for making clean documentation
