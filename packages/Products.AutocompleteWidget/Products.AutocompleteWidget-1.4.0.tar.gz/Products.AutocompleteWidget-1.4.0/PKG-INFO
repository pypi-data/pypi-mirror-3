Description: Overview
        ========
        
        To use this package just create a field like::
        
        StringField('test_field',
        default='',
        searchable=0,
        required=0,
        vocabulary=DisplayList((('week', 'Week'), ('wedding','Wedding'),
        ('winona','Winona'), ('winter', 'Winter'),
        ('weather','Weather'), ('cow', 'Cow'))),
        widget=AutocompleteWidget(label='Test Widget',
        description='Test this',
        ),
        enforceVocabulary=0,
        ),
        
        You can also use a LinesField instead of a StringField. The widget adapts automatically.
        This has the advantage that you can index the field in the catalog (keyword index). Combine this with
        the filter_bogus property on the widget and the widget will prepare the entered values.
        
        It's useless without a vocabulary, and setting enforceVocabulary true doesn't
        really make sense unless you use the LinesField.
        
        
        Configuration
        =============
        
        There are a few parameters that can be set to
        alter the behavior of the widget:
        
        actb_timeout:           How long (ms) before the autocomplete box times
        out and dissapears. (Default: 2500, -1 to disable)
        actb_lim:               How many choices to show in the autocomplete box
        at a time.  (default: 5)
        actb_firsttext:         Should the autocomplete serach be limited to the
        beginning of keyword (True), or should it search
        the entire entry for a match (False)? (default: 0)
        actb_filter_bogus:      remove keywords that are not in the vocabulary and
        also remove redundant keywords, leading/trailing spaces etc.
        
        actb_expand_onfocus:    expand the dropdown on focus.
        
        actb_complete_on_tab:   set to 0 if you want tab to move the focus to the next widget.
        default is 1.
