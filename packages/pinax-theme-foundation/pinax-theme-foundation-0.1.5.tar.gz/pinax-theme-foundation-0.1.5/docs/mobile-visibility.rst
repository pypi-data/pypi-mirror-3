Mobile Visibility
-----------------

`Zurb Foundation <http://foundation.zurb.com/>`_ includes a series of visibility classes that  
allow you to hide or display content on various devices using 'show/hide-on-x' where "x" can be 
a phone,tablet or desktop. For example if we include the following snippet on the line corresponding to the device 
that you are currently using will be displayed ::

    <strong class="show-on-desktops">You are on a desktop machine.</strong>
    <strong class="show-on-tablets">You are on a tablet device.</strong>
    <strong class="show-on-phones">You are on a smartphone like an iPhone or Android phone.</strong>


Conversely including ::

   <strong class="hide-on-desktops">You are not on a desktop machine.</strong>
   <strong class="hide-on-tablets">You are not on a tablet device.</strong>
   <strong class="hide-on-phones">You are not on a smartphone like an iPhone or Android phone.</strong>
   
Will display the two lines corresponding to the devices that you are not using.
