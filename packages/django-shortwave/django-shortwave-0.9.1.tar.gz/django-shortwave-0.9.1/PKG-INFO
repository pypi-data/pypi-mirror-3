Description: =================================================
        Django app for managing Shortwave command files
        =================================================
        
        This application provides the ability for users to create and manage
        custom command files for use with Shortwave_.
        
        Using the instructions found in the `default commands file`_, users can add
        their own commands to a custom wave file. They can then provide the URL of
        their custom commands file to Shortwave_ and save their new bookmarklet.
        
        From that point users can add, delete, and change their custom commands from a
        Web interface and their bookmarklet updates immediately (that's the beauty of
        Shortwave_).
        
        Refer to the documentation_ for further information.
