Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        ''collective.recipe.modwsgi'' is a `zc.buildout`_ recipe which creates
        a `paste.deploy`_ entry point for mod_wsgi_.
        
        It is very simple to use. This is a minimal ''buildout.cfg'' file
        which creates a WSGI script mod_python can use::
        
            [buildout]
            parts = mywsgiapp
        
            [mywsgiapp]
            recipe = collective.recipe.modwsgi
            eggs = mywsgiapp
            config-file = ${buildout:directory}/production.ini
        
        This will create a small python script in parts/mywsgiapp called
        ''wsgi'' which mod_wsgi can load. You can also use the optional
        ''extra-paths'' option to specify extra paths that are added to
        the python system path.
        
        The apache configuration for this buildout looks like this:::
        
            WSGIScriptAlias /mysite /home/me/buildout/parts/mywsgiapp/wsgi
        
            <Directory /home/me/buildout>
                Order deny,allow
                Allow from all
            </Directory>
        
        This recipe does not fully install packages, which means that console scripts
        will not be created. If you need console scripts you can add a second
        buildout part which uses `z3c.recipe.scripts`_ to do a full install.

        1.2 - August 7, 2009
        --------------------
        
        - Initialise the python logging module. Based on a patch from Philip Kershaw,
          which was based on a discussion on pylons-discuss:
          http://groups.google.com/group/pylons-discuss/browse_thread/thread/9b9add4529b3779c?pli=1

        1.1 - April 20, 2009
        --------------------
        
        * Add an 'extra-paths' option, similar the the zc.recipe.egg one.
          [chrism]
        
        
        1.0 - October 16, 2008
        ----------------------
        
        * No changes.
          [wichert]
        
        
        
        1.0rc1 - June 30, 2008
        ----------------------
        
        * Update the generated wrapper to test if a path is already in sys.path
          before adding it. This prevents paths being duplicated in sys.path
          when mod_wsgi reloads the module.
          [wichert]
        
        
        
        1.0b3 - June 23, 2008
        ---------------------
        
        * Do not make the recipe a subclass of zc.recipe.egg.Eggs but
          use a local instance to determine the working set.
          [wichert]
        
        * Format the sys.path changes in the wrapper to make it more
          human readable. This is purely cosmetic to help with debugging.
          [wichert]
        
        * Also recreate the wsgi wrapper file when updating a buildout part.
          This is needed to get get changes to versions in the working set
          (such as different version pins) reflected in the wrapper.

        1.0b2 - June 13, 2008
        ---------------------
        
        * Call the Eggs constructor as well: working_set() needs too many of the
          internal variables it sets for us to set them ourselves. This fixes
          the recipe breaking when using find-links in buildout.

        1.0b1 - June 13, 2008
        ---------------------
        
        * Initial release
