        Python library for interacting with the Sunlight Labs API.
        
        The Sunlight Labs API provides legislator information and district lookups.
        
        (http://services.sunlightlabs.com/api/)
        
        python-sunlightapi is a project of Sunlight Labs (c) 2010.

        Source: http://github.com/sunlightlabs/python-sunlightapi/
        
        The package can be installed via pip, easy_install or by downloading the
        source and running ``python setup.py install``.
        
        Requirements
        ============
        
        python >= 2.4
        
        simplejson >= 1.8 (not required with python 2.6, will use built in json module)
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        To initialize the api, all that is required is for it to be imported and for an
        API key to be defined.
        
        (If you do not have an API key visit http://services.sunlightlabs.com/api/ to
        register for one.)
        
        Import ``sunlight`` from ``sunlightapi``:
            
            >>> from sunlightapi import sunlight, SunlightApiError
            
        And set your API key:
            
            >>> sunlight.apikey = 'your-key-here'
        
        -------------------
        legislators methods
        -------------------
        
        The legislators namespace is comprised of several functions:
            * legislators.get           - get a single legislator
            * legislators.getList       - get zero or more legislators
            * legislators.search        - fuzzy search for legislators by name
            * legislators.allForZip     - get all legislators representing a zipcode
            * legislators.allForLatLong - get all legislators representing a point
        
        
        get and getList
        ---------------
            
        legislators.get and legislators.getList both take any number of parameters and
        return all legislators that match the provided criteria.  These parameters are
        also the ones returned in each legislator object.  
        
        The available parameters are:
            * title
            * firstname
            * middlename
            * lastname
            * name_suffix
            * nickname
            * party
            * state
            * district
            * in_office
            * gender
            * birthdate
            * phone
            * fax
            * website
            * webform
            * email
            * congress_office
            * bioguide_id
            * votesmart_id
            * fec_id
            * govtrack_id
            * crp_id
            * eventful_id
            * congresspedia_url
            * twitter_id
            * official_rss
            * youtube_url
            * senate_class
            * birthdate
        
        
        To get the representative that represents NC-4:
        
            >>> print(sunlight.legislators.get(state='NC', district='4'))
            Rep. David Price (D-NC)
            
        legislators.getList works much the same way, but returns a list.  It is
        possible to do a more complex query, for instance
        "all legislators from New York that are Republicans":
        
            >>> for leg in sunlight.legislators.getList(state='NY', party='R'):
            ...     print(leg)
            Rep. Pete King (R-NY)
            Rep. Christopher Lee (R-NY)
        
        
        **It is preferred that you do not call getList without parameters as it will
        pull down all legislators, if you need to do this feel free to grab the provided
        dump of the API data available at http://services.sunlightlabs.com/api/**
        
        
        search
        ------
        
        legislators.search allows you to query the database with a less than perfect
        representation of a legislator's name.
        
        The search is tolerant of use of nicknames, lastname-firstname juxtaposition,
        initials and minor misspellings.  The return is a set of results that include
        legislator records as well as certainity scores between 0 and 1 (where 1 is
        most certain).
        
        Search takes two optional parameters
        
        ``threshold``
            the minimum score you want to return, the default is 0.8 and you should rarely go lower than 0.7.
        ``all_legislators``
            if True will search legislators in the API that are no longer in office (default is False)
        
        An example usage of search is as follows:
        
            >>> for r in sunlight.legislators.search('Diane Finestine'):
            ...     print(r)
            0.92125 Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA)
        
            
        It is also possible to get multiple results:
            
            >>> for r in sunlight.legislators.search('Frank'):
            ...     print(r)
            1.0 Rep. Barney Frank (D-MA)
            0.972222222222 Rep. Trent Franks (R-AZ)
            0.952380952381 Sen. Al Franken (D-MN)
        
        
        allForZip
        ---------
        
        legislators.allForZip retrieves all legislators that represent a given zipcode.
        
        This typically means two senators and one (or more) representatives.
        
        To get all legislators that represent the 27511 zipcode:
            
            >>> for legislator in sunlight.legislators.allForZip(27511):
            ...     print(legislator)
            Rep. David Price (D-NC)
            Sen. Kay Hagan (D-NC)
            Sen. Richard Burr (R-NC)
            Rep. Brad Miller (D-NC)
        
        
        allForLatLong
        -------------
        
        legislators.allForLatLong retrieves all legislators representing a given point.
        
        This is a shortcut for calling districts.getDistrictFromLatLong and then
        looking up the district representative and state senators.
        
        To get all legislators that represent a location in western PA at 41.92, -80.14:
            
            >>> for legislator in sunlight.legislators.allForLatLong(41.92, -80.14):
            ...     print(legislator)
            Sen. Bob Casey (D-PA)
            Sen. Arlen Specter (D-PA)
            Rep. Kathy Dahlkemper (D-PA)
        
        
        -----------------
        districts methods
        -----------------
        
        The districts namespace is comprised of two functions:
            * districts.getDistrictsFromZip
            * districts.getDistrictFromLatLong
        
        
        getDistrictsFromZip
        -------------------
        
        districts.getDistrictsFromZip fetches all districts that overlap a given
        zipcode.
        
        To get all districts that overlap 14623:
            >>> for district in sunlight.districts.getDistrictsFromZip(14623):
            ...     print(district)
            NY-29
            NY-28
        
        
        getDistrictFromLatLong
        ----------------------
        
        districts.getDistrictFromLatLong finds the district that a given lat-long
        coordinate pair falls within.
        
        To find out what district 61.13 N, 149.54 W falls within:
            >>> print(sunlight.districts.getDistrictFromLatLong(61.13, 149.54))
            AK-0
        
        This point is in fact in Anchorage, Alaska, so this is correct.
        
        
        -----------------
        committee methods
        -----------------
        
        The committee namespace contains:
            * committee.getList
            * committee.get
            * committee.allForMember
        
        getList
        -------
        
        committee.getList gets all committees for a given chamber (House, Senate, or Joint).
        
        To see all joint committees for the current congress:
            >>> for c in sunlight.committees.getList('Joint'):
            ...     print(c)
            Joint Economic Committee
            Joint Committee on Printing
            Joint Committee on Taxation
            Joint Committee on the Library
        
        get
        ---
        
        committee.get gets full details for a given committee, including membership and subcommittees.
        
        Example of getting details for a committee:
        
            >>> com = sunlight.committees.get('HSAG')
            >>> print(com.name)
            House Committee on Agriculture
            >>> for sc in com.subcommittees:
            ...     print(sc)
            Subcommittee on  Conservation, Credit, Energy, and Research
            Subcommittee on Department Operations, Oversight, Nutrition and Forestry

            >>> for m in com.members:
