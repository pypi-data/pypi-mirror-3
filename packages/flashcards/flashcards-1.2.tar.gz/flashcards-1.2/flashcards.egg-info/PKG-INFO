        Study has three components:
        
        quiz.py - data.py - quiz_maker.py - __main__.py
        
        
        ========================================================================
        INSTALLATION
        ========================================================================
        Use:
            python setup.py install
        That should do the trick.
        
        
        ========================================================================
        GENERAL USAGE
        ========================================================================
        NOTE:
        importing flashcards creates a data.py file in the current working directory.
        flashcards uses the local data.py file in the cwd.
        flashcards may truncate the existing data.py, so be careful with your quizzes.
        
        If installed:
            in the python shell:
                import flashcards
                #That should activate the menu UI
            
        If not installed:
            Run menu.py in flashcards/flashcards
        
        ALSO:
        
        For changes to take effect when editing data.py, you need to exit the program and re-enter.
        ========================================================================
        1)quiz.py
        
            This is the main script. It takes the questions and answers from data.py
            and uses them to quiz the user. That is all.
            
        2)data.py
        
            This is data script. It uses two ordered lists, questions and answers. T
            he index numbers in each list correspond to each other.
            
            questions:
                This is a list of strings, containing the questions.
                
            answers:
                This is a list of strings and/or tuples with strings in them. quiz.py
                knows how to tell the difference between tuples and strings and handl
                e them.
            
        3)quiz_maker.py
        
            All this script does is provide an interface for quickly writing questio
            ns to data.py to make things easier. With this script, you won't even ne
            ed to touch data.py yourself.
            
            USAGE
            
            QUESTION:
                When the user is prompted to enter a question, it is stored as a string 
                using the raw_input() statement.
        
            ANSWER:
                When the user is prompted to enter an answer, it is stored with the inp
                ut() statement.
                
                ENTERING A SINGLE ANSWER:
                    Encapsulate the answer with apostrophes or quotation marks.
                    
                ENTERING MULTIPLE ANSWERS:
                    Write the answer as a tuple.
                    
                    Encapsulate the whole statement with parentheses, and each value ne
                    eds to be encapsulated as if you were entering a single answer, with
                    apostrophes or quotation marks.
                    
        4) __main__.py
        
            Just a menu interface for user convenience, it makes use of all the scripts in the package.
