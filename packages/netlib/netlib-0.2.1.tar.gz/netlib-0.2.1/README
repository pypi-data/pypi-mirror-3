Netlib is a collection of network utility classes, used by pathod and mitmproxy
projects. It differs from other projects in some fundamental respects, because
both pathod and mitmproxy often need to violate standards. This means that
protocols are implemented as small, well-contained and flexible functions, and
servers are implemented to allow misbehaviour when needed.

At this point, I have no plans to make netlib useful beyond mitmproxy and
pathod. Please get in touch if you think parts of netlib might have broader
utility.
