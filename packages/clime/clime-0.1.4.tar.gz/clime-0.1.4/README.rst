Clime
=====

**Note**: The 0.1.4 is a rewrote version and it does **not** provide backward compatibility.

Clime let you convert a module, a dict or an instance into a multi-command CLI
program.

It scans the object to find the functions out, so it is **low couple** with
your source.

And, it scan the aliases and metavars of options from docstring, so you are free
from writing the settings of options. You can focus on writing the help text of
your CLI program.

It is a better choice than the heavy `optparse` or `argparse` for simple CLI tasks.

Let me show an example for you.

See the full documentaion on http://docs.mosky.tw/clime/ .

CLI-ize ME!
-----------

Here we have a simple script with docstring here: ::

    # filename: repeat.py
    
    def repeat(string, time=2):
        '''repeat string n times

        options:
            -n N, --time N  repeat N times.
        '''
        
        print string * time

After add this line, ::

    import clime.now

... you now have a CLI program! ::
    
    $ python repeat.py twice
    twice
    twice

    $ python repeat.py -n3 thrice
    thrice
    thrice
    thrice

And it gerneate the usage from your function: ::

    $ python repeat.py --help
    usage: [--time N | -n N] STRING
       or: repeat [--time N | -n N] STRING

If you wrote a docstring, it will also show up in help text. ::

    $ python repeat.py repeat --help
    usage: [--time N | -n N] STRING
       or: repeat [--time N | -n N] STRING

    repeat string n times

    options:
        -n N, --time N  repeat N times.
    
You can find more examples in the `clime/examples`_.

See `Command.scan`_ for more details about argument parsing.
