- Minor bugfixes and improvements.


# Changes in release 1.5 (2011-07-25)

- Added compatibility for Plone 4.  Plone 3.x support has been dropped.
  Plone 3 users should use ECAssignmentBox 1.4.x.


# Changes in release 1.4.3 (2011-04-29)

- Minor improvements.


# Changes in release 1.4.2 (2009-09-30)

- ECAssignmentBox is now eggified and uploaded to PyPI.  An old-style 
  tarball distribution is still available at plone.org.

- It's now possible to modify the submission period and other settings 
  for more than one assignment box at a time by using the ``set 
  assignment box options`` action on ECFolder's content tab.

- Fixed issue: Assignments in state superseded can not be accessed by
  the owner.

- Fixed issue: ECAssignmentBox int argument error.  After a students 
  submission is graded and state changed to Graded an ``TypeError: 
  int argument required`` appears on the statistics tab.


# Changes in release 1.4 (2009-02-04)

- ECAssignmentBox was completly re-implemented with support for Plone 
  3.x.


# Changes in release 1.3 (2007-06-27)

- ECFolders and assignment boxes now have an *analysis* tab which 
  provides more information about contained assignments, e.g., number
  of attempts users needed for an assignment or number of submissions 
  per day.

- The *assignments (full)* view (shows the full text of all assignments
  on one page) is now integrated in the *assignments* tab.

- New content type ECAssignmentTask, which can be used to build a
  repository of assignments; ECAssignmentTask objects can be
  referenced from ECAssignmentBoxes.

- If an assignment box is located inside an ECLecture object which
  requires registration, submissions are only allowed for users
  enrolled in the course.


# Changes in release 1.2 (2007-02-28)

- Added field ``Maximum number of attempts`` to ECAssignmentBox to
  restrict the number of resubmissions.

- Implemented issue #118: For box owners and managers it is now
  possible make submissions even if the assignment box is in state
  ``public draft`` or ``private``, and to make any number of
  resubmissions.

- In the *assignments* view:

  - If there is more than one assignment box inside an ECFolder one
    will see a table for each box.  Clicking the check box in one of
    the tables' header will check or uncheck all entries inside this
    table only and *not* all entries in all tables.

  - Now it is possible to toggle the view of superseded assignments.

  - Added clickable workflow states (assignments can now be filtered
    by workflow state).

  - Added delete button and polished the ``change state`` controls.

- As addition to the *assignments* view, owners and managers can use
  the *assignments (full)* tab to see the full text of all assignments
  on one page.

- If the parent of an assignment box is an ECFolder and this ECFolder
  contains directions, the directions will be shown inside a
  collapsible box on top of the assignment box.

- Fixed issue #119: Uploads can now be any size.

- Fixed issue #120: Students do not see shared assignments of other
  users in the *statistics* view.

- Performance improvements: We are now using portal_catalog where
  possible.
