Installation Instructions
*************************

Build this python binding in a single command using a typical setup.py:
$ ./setup.py install

----
Before installing, you might want to test compilation with:
$ ./setup.py build
$ ./setup.py test
If the test fails, there must be a problem with your library. I would suggest you to report us a bug.

All typical options of a Python setup are available. For details, check:
$ ./setup.py install --help

For instance to install in your locale prefix, if this one is /home/me/.local/:
$ ./setup.py install --prefix=/home/me/.local/

This way, if you use (for instance Python 2.6), the library will be installed in: /home/me/.local/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/cld.so
