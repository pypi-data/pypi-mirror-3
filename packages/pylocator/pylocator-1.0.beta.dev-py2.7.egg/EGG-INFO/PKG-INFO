Description: The PyLocator-program
        =====================
        
        A little program for localization of EEG-electrodes from MRI-recordings.
        Uses VTK for a neat 3d-interface. 
        
        Building the docs
        ----------------------
        
        To build the docs you need to have setuptools and sphinx (>=0.5) installed. 
        Run the command::
        
            python setup.py build_sphinx
        
        The docs are built in the build/sphinx/html directory.
        
        
        Making a source tarball
        ----------------------------
        
        To create a source tarball, eg for packaging or distributing, run the
        following command::
        
            python setup.py sdist
        
        The tarball will be created in the `dist` directory. This command will
        compile the docs, and the resulting tarball can be installed with
        no extra dependencies than the Python standard library. You will need
        setuptool and sphinx.
        
        Making a release and uploading it to PyPI
        ------------------------------------------
        
        This command is only run by project manager, to make a release, and
        upload in to PyPI::
        
            python setup.py sdist bdist_egg register upload
