        Introduction
        ============
        
        This module provides the user interface for managing content translations. It's the app package of the next generation Plone multilingual engine. It's designed to work with Dexterity content types and the *old fashioned* Archetypes based content types as well. It only works with Plone 4.1 and above due to the use of UUIDs to reference the translations.
        
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        For using this package with Dexterity content types you should add to your *eggs* buildout section::
        
            eggs =
                plone.app.multilingual [dexterity]
        
        If you want to use it with Archetypes based content types::
        
            eggs =
                plone.app.multilingual [archetypes]
        
        [...] (WIP)
