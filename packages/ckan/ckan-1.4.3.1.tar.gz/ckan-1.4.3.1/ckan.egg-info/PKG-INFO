Description: The CKAN software is used to run the Comprehensive Knowledge Archive
        Network (CKAN) site: http://www.ckan.net.
        
        The Comprehensive Knowledge Archive Network is a registry of open
        knowledge packages and projects (and a few closed ones). CKAN is the
        place to search for open knowledge resources as well as register your
        own - be that a set of Shakespeare's works, a global population density
        database, the voting records of MPs, or 30 years of US patents.
        
        Those familiar with freshmeat or CPAN can think of CKAN as providing an
        analogous service for open knowledge.
