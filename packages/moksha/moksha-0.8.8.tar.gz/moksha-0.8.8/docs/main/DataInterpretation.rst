===================
Data Interpretation
===================

Moksha provides various mechanisms that allow applications to more easily interpret
dynamic data and act on it.

Collaborative glue
------------------

Although it does not yet, Moksha will allow anything to be
tagged, shared, discussed, annotated, rated, etc.

Live streams
------------

Any data source, even if moksha has to occasionally poll it, can be displayed
as a 'live' widget.  :doc:`Producers` can also easily expose
themselves through an AMQP/STOMP message queue or 0mq message filter, allowing
other applications and services to interact with new data, as it is discovered.

Consumers
---------

Moksha allows plugins to monitor arbitrary message `"topics"`, giving
developers the ability to register actions on arbitrary events.

Extension Points
----------------

Moksha gives developers the ability to add additional functionality to predictable
patterns found within dynamic data streams.  For example, an extension point
could find all occurences of known project names within a data feed, and easily
turn them into a dynamic hover menu that could display related data.
