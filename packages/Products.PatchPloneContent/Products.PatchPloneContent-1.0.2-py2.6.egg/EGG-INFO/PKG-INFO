Description: PatchPloneContent is a collection of utilities, used to add or alter
        how standard Plone content types work using the monkeypatch technique.
        
        Variables of interest in this module are content_types, a tuple
        collection of the class definitions of standard content types.
        
        The functions of interest are content_classes_add_fields, which
        accepts a sequence of content classes as the first argument, and a
        sequence of fields to add as the second argument.  As well as
        add_validator, which inserts validators into fields.
