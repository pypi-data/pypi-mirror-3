Django Activity Stream
=======================

FYI: there is a second django-activity-stream. Some people have been telling me that it is simpler to use, has less joins etc. I don't have time to double check that, so see for yourself: http://github.com/justquick/django-activity-stream .

This is a reusable Django application with which you can log activities your users are making
and displaying a stream similar to the activity stream in facebook.

Users can choose to Follow other Users activity Streams.

Activity Items can have a safetylevel...so you can decide if they are public or just for friends.

Activity Items can be commented and "liked". If you like an activity item of another user,
all your followers will see it too.


To define different Types of Activities:
ActivityTypes.objects.create(name="started_following", batch_time_minutes=30, is_batchable=True, is_batchable=True)


To create an activity (when the user does something):
from activity_stream.models import create_activity_item
create_activity_item(type, user, subject, data=None, safetylevel=1, custom_date=None)

* custom_date can be used to create activities now that wont display until a date in the future. This is useful when content can be created 
  by the user that should not show up on the site until a certain time.
* safetylevel is used to define if activities can only be seen by friends, or if they are public
* data is a hashmap of extra context variables that can be used in the template rendering


Integration into existing Networks:
If you have preexisting networks like Friends, Contacts etc. you can define two functions in your settings file
that the activity app will use to find the people you follow when your stream is rendered.

ACTIVITY_GET_PEOPLE_I_FOLLOW = lambda user: get_people_i_follow(user)
ACTIVITY_GET_MY_FOLLOWERS = lambda user: get_my_followers(user)


Templates for Rendering:
The app looks for the templates to render the stream in the following folder:
templates/activity_stream/<activity_type>/full.html
templates/activity_stream/<activity_type>/full_batched.html


What is Batching?
Some actions happen a lot, eg.: placing images on a map (thats my case). So instead of displaying an activity item
each and every time these actions can be batched by using:

is_batchable=True

furthermore you can set the batch time:

batch_time_minutes=30

so if repeat an action within 30 Minutes they will be one activity item with 2 Subjects, instead of 2 Activities with
one Subject each.

TODO:
Comments don't work yet
Blocking people in your news stream
filter for only certain activities
realtime update for activities ... like foursquare

================================================================
This is still the Alpha version...improvements coming soon.
