Description: Renders ALSA audio samples into an oscilloscope-like display
        
        This is a demonstration project which renders ALSA audio samples (16-bit integer streams) using (core) OpenGL. It is intended to serve as sample code for setting up shader-based rendering of basic data-sets (in this case, a ring-buffer of 16-bit integers). The code is currently just "get it done" level, without worrying about efficiency or best-practice coding.
        
        Development targets include the ability to zoom in on the sample data set (i.e. use a matrix to multiply the data being presented), the ability to mark/calibrate the display, adding more data-sources, and cleaning up the code.
