Description: 
                The EyeFi cards include both some 2-8GB of SDHC storage and an
                embedded microprocessor with WiFi (802.11bgn) that can upload
                images as soon as they have been captured. While the software
                bundled with the cards is closed and Win/OSX only, the protocol
                is decently clean SOAP (like XML RPC via HTTP) and can be
                implemented with twisted and soappy.
                
                After associating with one of the configured wireless networks,
                the card authenticates a session with the server. The shared
                secret needs to be obtained from the settings of the Win/OSX
                application. The server can cope with multiple cards that are
                identified by their MAC address. After authentication, the card
                pushes the images that have not yet been posted to the server.
                The server unpacks the tarred bundle (optionally in a directory
                per MAC address). It then resolves the wireless networks that were
                logged by the card at the time the picture was taken into a
                geolocation using the Google API. The geolocation data is stored
                in an XMP sidecar. Finally, you can trigger your own scripts
                on complete upload, extraction and tagging.
