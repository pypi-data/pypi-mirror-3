Description: Kotti is a user-friendly, light-weight and extensible `web content
        management system`_.  It is licensed under a `BSD-like license
        <http://repoze.org/license.html>`_
        
        Features
        ========
        
        - **User-friendly**: a simple edit interface hides advanced
          functionality from less experienced users
        
        - **WYSIWYG editor**: includes a rich text editor that lets you edit
          content like in office applications
        
        - **Security**: advanced user, groups and user roles management; uses
          `access control lists`_ (ACL) to control access to different parts
          of the site
        
        - **Templating**: extend Kotti with your own look & feel with very
          little programming required
        
        - **Customizable**: Many aspects of Kotti are configured through a
          simple INI file
        
        - **Add-ons**: a plug-in system allows third party software to greatly
          extend Kotti
        
        - **Pluggable authentication**: allows authentication of users through
          LDAP or other existing user databases
        
        - **Open**: built on top of well-documented, open source components,
          such as Python_, Pyramid_ and SQLAlchemy_
        
        - **Tested**: `continuous testing`_ with a test coverage of 100%
          guarantees Kotti's stability

        History
        =======
        
        0.5.0 - Unreleased
        ------------------
        
        - Move Kotti's default user interface to use Twitter Bootstrap 2.
        
        - Add a new 'File' content type.
        
        - Add CSRF protection to some forms.
        
        - Remove Kotti's ``FormController`` in favor of using ``pyramid_deform``.
        
        - Use plone.i18n to normalize titles to URL parts.
        
        - Add a separate navigation screen that replaces the former
          intelligent breadcrumbs menu.
        
        - Use ``pyramid_beaker`` as the default session factory.
        
        0.4.5 - 2012-01-19
        ------------------
        
        - Add 'kotti.security.has_permission' which may be used instead of
          'pyramid.security.has_permission'.
        
          The difference is that Kotti's version will set the "authorization
          context" to be the context that you pass to 'has_permission'.  The
          effect is that 'list_groups' will return a more correct list of
          local roles, i.e. the groups in the given context instead of
          'request.context'.
        
        - Add a template ('forbidden.pt') for when user is logged in but still
          getting HTTPForbidden.
        
        0.4.4 - 2012-01-05
        ------------------
        
        - The "Forbidden View" will no longer redirect clients that don't
          accept 'text/html' to the login form.
        
        - Fix bug with 'kotti.site_title' setting.
        
        0.4.3 - 2011-12-22
        ------------------
        
        - Add 'kotti.root_factory' setting which allows the override Kotti's
          default Pyramid *root factory*.  Also, make master templates more
          robust so that a minimal root with '__parent__' and '__name__' can
          be rendered.
        
        - The 'kotti.tests' was factored out.  Tests should now import from
          'kotti.testing'.
        
        0.4.2 - 2011-12-20
        ------------------
        
        - More convenient overrides for add-on packages by better use of
          'config.commit()'.
        
        0.4.1 - 2011-12-20
        ------------------
        
        - Modularize Kotti's Paste App Factory 'kotti.main'.
        
        - Allow explicit setting of tables that Kotti creates
          ('kotti.use_tables').
        
        0.4.0 - 2011-12-14
        ------------------
        
        - Remove configuration variables 'kotti.templates.*' in favour of
          'kotti.asset_overrides', which uses Pyramid asset specs and their
          overrides.
        
        - Remove 'TemplateAPI.__getitem__' and instead add 'TemplateAPI.macro'
          which has a similar but less 'special' API.
        
        - Factor snippets in 'kotti/templates/snippets.pt' out into their own
          templates.  Use 'api.render_template' to render them instead of
          macros.
        
        0.3.1 - 2011-12-09
        ------------------
        
        - Add 'keys' method to mutation dicts (see 0.3.0).
        
        0.3.0 - 2011-11-30
        -------------------
        
        - Replace `Node.__annotations__` in favor of an extended `Node.annotations`.
        
          `Node.annotations` will attempt to not only recognize changes to
          subobjects of type dict, it will also handle list objects
          transparently.  That is, changing arbitrary JSON structures should
          just work with regard to calling `node.annotations.changed()` when
          the structure was changed.
        
        0.2.10 - 2011-11-22
        -------------------
        
        - 'api.format_datetime' now also accepts a timestamp in addition to datetime.
        
        0.2.9 - 2011-11-21
        ------------------
        
        - Remove MANIFEST.in in favour of using 'setuptools-git'.
        
        0.2.8 - 2011-11-21
        ------------------
        
        - Remove 'PasteScript' dependency since that would result in spurious
          errors when installing Kotti. See
          http://jenkins.danielnouri.org/job/Kotti/42/TOXENV=py27/console
        
        0.2.7 - 2011-11-20
        ------------------
        
        - Add 'PasteScript' dependency.
        
        - Fix #11 where 'python setup.py test' would look into a hard-coded
          'bin' directory.
        
        - Structural analysis documentation. (Unfinished; in 'analysis' directory
          during development. Will be moved to main docs when finished.)
        
        0.2.6 - 2011-11-17
        ------------------
        
        - Add `Node.__annotations__` convenience attribute.
        
          `Node.__annotations__` will wrap the annotations dict in such a way
          that both item and attribute access are possible.  It'll also record
          changes to dicts inside dicts and mark the parent `__annotations__`
          attribute as dirty.
        
        - Add a welcome page.
        - Delete the demo added in version 0.2.4.
        
        0.2.5 - 2011-11-14
        ------------------
        
        - Add 'TemplateAPI.render_template'; allow templates to be rendered
          conveniently from templates.
        
        0.2.4 - 2011-11-13
        ------------------
        
        - Adjust for Pyramid 1.2: INI file, pyramid_tm, Wsgiref server, pcreate and
          pserve. (MO)
        
        - Add Kotti Demo source and documentation.
        
        0.2.3 - 2011-10-28
        ------------------
        
        - ``Node.__getitem__`` will now also accept a tuple as key.
        
          ``folder['1', '2']`` is the same as ``folder['1']['2']``, just more
          efficient.
        
        - Added a new cache decorator based on ``repoze.lru``.
        
        0.2.2 - 2011-10-10
        ------------------
        
        - Change the function signature of ``kotti.authn_policy_factory``,
          ``kotti.authz_policy_factory`` and ``kotti.session_factory`` to
          include all settings from the configuration file.
        
        0.2.1 - 2011-09-29
        ------------------
        
        - Minor changes to events setup code to ease usage in tests.
        
        0.2 - 2011-09-16
        ----------------
        
        - No changes.
        
        0.2a2 - 2011-09-05
        ------------------
        
        - Fix templates to be compatible with Chameleon 2.  Also, require
          Chameleon>=2.
        
        - Require pyramid>=1.2.  Also, enable pyramid_debugtoolbar for
          ``development.ini`` profile.
        
        0.2a1 - 2011-08-29
        ------------------
        
        - Improve database schema for ``Nodes``.  Split ``Node`` class into
          ``Node`` and ``Content``.
        
          This change is backward incompatible in that existing content types
          in your code will need to subclass ``Content`` instead of ``Node``.
          The example in the docs has been updated.  Also, the underlying
          database schema has changed.
        
        - Improve user database hashing and local roles storage.
        
        - Compatibility fix for Pyramid 1.2.
