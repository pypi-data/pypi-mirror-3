Description: pycksum - A Python implementation of the cksum algorithm
        
        The ``cksum`` algorithm generates a checksum for a stream of data. While cksum is not cryptographically strong, it can be used to validate the integrity of transferred files.
        
        Pycksum includes a pure Python implementation of ``cksum`` as well as an efficient C extension that will automatically be used on platforms that support it.
        
        Installation
        ============
            $ pip install pycksum
        
        Examples
        ========
        
        The simplest way to use pycksum is to just give it a string::
        
            import pycksum
            ck = pycksum.cksum("Any string")
        
        You can pass in a file or an iterable::
        
            ck = pycksum.cksum( open("filename"))
        
            ck = pycksum.cksum( ["This", "love", "is", "taking", "its", "toll", "on me"])
        
        If you have a lot of data to process, it's more memory-efficient to calculate the cksum incrementally::
        
            c = pycksum.Cksum()
            for data in input_fd:
                c.add(data)
            ck = c.get_cksum()
            sz = c.get_size()
