""" Pyflation - Cosmological simulations in Python

Pyflation is a python package to simulate cosmological perturbations in the early universe.
Using the Klein-Gordon equations for both first and second order perturbations, 
the evolution and behaviour of these perturbations can be studied.

The main entry point to this package is the cosmomodels module, which contains the main
simulation classes. 
Configuration of the simulation runs can be changed in the configuration.py and run_config.py files.
