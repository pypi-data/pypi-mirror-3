Description: 
        Currently supports dBase III, and FoxPro - Visual FoxPro tables. Text is returned as unicode, and codepage settings in tables are honored. Documentation needs work, but author is very responsive to e-mails.
        
        Not supported: index files (but can create tempory non-file indexes), null fields (data returned is blank), and auto-incrementing fields.
        
        This version is backwards-incompatible as far as the default types of returned data.  However, it does supply backwards-compatible custom data types that can be specified when tables are opened: Char (auto-trims white-space), Date & DateTime (allows False values), and Logical (allows unknown values).  To get the old behavior with a dBase III table would look like this:  table = Table(somefile, default_data_types=dict(C=Char, L=Logical, D=Date, T=DateTime, M=Char))
