        Overview
        --------
        
        This package implements some `Facebook`_ `Social Plugins`_ as portlets for
        your Plone site.
        
        This package depends on `collective.facebook.accounts`_.
        
        Currently, the following portlets are available:
        
        Facebook Wall portlet
            This portlet displays the user's Facebook Wall and their News Feed.
        
        Facebook Activity Feed portlet
            This portlet is based on the Activity Feed plugin and it has some UI
            limitations. The Activity Feed plugin displays the most interesting recent
            activity taking place on your site. Since the content is hosted by
            Facebook, the plugin can display personalized content whether or not the
            user has logged into your site. The activity feed displays stories when
            users interact with content on your site, such as like, watch, read, play
            or any custom action. Activity is also displayed when users share content
            from your site in Facebook or if they comment on a page on your site in
            the Comments box. If a user is logged into Facebook, the plugin will be
            personalized to highlight content from their friends. If the user is
            logged out, the activity feed will show recommendations from across your
            site, and give the user the option to log in to Facebook.
        
        Don't panic
        -----------
        
        Facebook Wall portlet
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

        - Choose the Facebook account to use from the drop-down.
        - Enter the ID of the wall you want to be listed (e.g. plonecms).
        - Enter the maximum number of entries you want the portlet to show.
        - Mark the checkbox if you want only the posts made from the wall owner to be
          shown (plonecms in this case), or leave it unmarked if you want all posts no
          matter who posted them.
        
        That's it.

        To do list
        ----------
        
        In the near future we are going to release a new version including the
        following features:
        
        `Recommendations Box portlet`_
            This portlet will be based on the Recommendations Box plugin. The
            Recommendations Box shows personalized recommendations to your users.
            Since the content is hosted by Facebook, the plugin can display
            personalized recommendations whether or not the user has logged into your
            site. To generate the recommendations, the plugin considers all the social
            interactions with URLs from your site. For a logged in Facebook user, the
            plugin will give preference to and highlight objects her friends have
            interacted with.

        Installation
        ------------
        
        To enable this product in a buildout-based installation:
        
        1. Edit your buildout.cfg and add ``collective.facebook.portlets`` to the list
           of eggs to install ::
        
            [buildout]
            ...
            eggs =
                collective.facebook.portlets
        
        2. You may need to extend a five.grok known good set (KGS) to make sure that
           you get the right versions of the packages that make up five.grok ::
        
            [buildout]
            ...
            extends =
                http://good-py.appspot.com/release/five.grok/1.2.0-1
        
        After updating the configuration you need to run ''bin/buildout'', which will
        take care of updating your system.
        
        Go to the 'Site Setup' page in a Plone site and click on the 'Add-ons' link.
        
        Check the box next to ''collective.facebook.portlets'' and click the
        'Activate' button.
        
        Note: You may have to empty your browser cache and save your resource
        registries in order to see the effects of the product installation.
