Description: Alnair
        ======
        
        Alnair is a simple system configuration framework.
        And also are intended to be used in conjunction with the Fabric (https://github.com/fabric/fabric).
        
        Requirement
        -----------
        
        - Python 2.6 and later (but does not work in 3.x)
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        from pypi::
        
           # using pip
           % pip install -U alnair
        
           # or using easy_install
           % easy_install -U alnair
        
        from source::
        
           % python setup.py install
        
        Basic usage
        -----------
        
        First, generate the recipes template set by following command::
        
           % alnair generate template archlinux
        
        In this example, distribution name using ``archlinux``.
        ``recipes/archlinux/common.py`` directories and file are created to current directory by this command.
        Also "``g``" as an alias for the ``generate`` command has been defined.
        The following command is same meaning as above::
        
           % alnair g template archlinux
        
        Next, edit ``install_command`` variable in ``common.py`` for the target distribution::
        
           # common.py
           install_command = 'pacman -Sy'
        
        Next, generate recipe template for package setup by following command::
        
           % alnair g recipe python
        
        ``python.py`` file is created on ``recipes/archlinux/`` directory by this command.
        In fact, directories where you want to create the files are ``recipes/*/``.
        
        Finally, edit ``python.py`` for more settings if necessary and setup to the server by following command::
        
           % alnair setup archlinux python
        
        Using as a library
        ------------------
        
        You can use the following code instead of "``alnair setup archlinux python``" command::
        
           from alnair import Distribution
        
           distname = 'archlinux'
           with Distribution(distname) as dist:
               dist.setup('python')
