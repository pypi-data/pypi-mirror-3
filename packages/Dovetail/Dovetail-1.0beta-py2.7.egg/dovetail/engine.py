"""An enumeration capturing the state of execution.

:class:`Execution` is modelled as a state machine with the following states:

    0. STATE.STARTED: The :class:`Execution` instance has been freshly created
    1. STATE.DEPENDENTS: The :class:`Processor` is executing the :class:`.Task`
       dependencies from :class:`.Dependencies`
    2. STATE.RUNNING: The :class:`Processor` is executing the main body of the
       :class:`.Task`
    3. STATE.CALLING: A :class:`.Task` is programmatically calling another
       :class:`.Task`
    4. STATE.SKIPPED: Directives caused the :class:`.Task` to be skipped
       (not executed) but treated as successful
    5. STATE.SUCCEEDED: The :class:`.Task` completed normally
    6. STATE.FAILED: The :class:`.Task` itself failed (raising an exception)
    7. STATE.ABORTED: A dependent :class:`.Task` of this :class:`.Task` failed.
       The :class:`Processor` makes no attempt to run the main body of the
       :class:`.Task`
    8. STATE.REPEATED: A :class:`.Task` had already been executed (perhaps
       as a dependency or directly invoked); it is not executed again

And models state transitions as:

.. parsed-literal::
          .---------------------------------------------------.
         /  .-----------------------------------> SKIPPED >--.|
        /  /  .----------------------.                       ||
       /  /  /                       |   .------> SUCCEEDED  ||
      /  /  /                        v  /                    ||
     STARTED ---> DEPENDENTS ---> RUNNING >-----> FAILED <---+'
        |             |            |   ^            ^
        v             v            v   |            |
     REPEATED      ABORTED        CALLING >---------'

.. note::

     * If a directive fails in :meth:`.TaskWrapper.before` or
       :meth:`.TaskWrapper.after` the state will transition directly to
       FAILED and the system will stop
     * If @fail_if_skipped is used, then SKIPPED will transition to FAILED
     * The DEPENDENTS state will be skipped if there are no dependents
     * If a dependent :class:`Task` fails, the parent is then ABORTED
     * RUNNING transits to CALLING if the :class:`Task` calls
       :func:`build`. Normally this returns to RUNNING, but if the called
       Task fails, the calling task transitions to FAILED
