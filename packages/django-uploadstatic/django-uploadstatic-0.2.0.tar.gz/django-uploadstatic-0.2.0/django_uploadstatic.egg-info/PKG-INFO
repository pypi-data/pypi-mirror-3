Description: ===================
        django-uploadstatic
        ===================
        
        This is a Django app that provides helpers for uploading static files.
        
        It is based off of `github.com/jezdez/django-staticfiles`_
        but only uploads all the files in the collected `STATIC_ROOT` to S3 using
        the ``storages.backends.s3boto.S3BotoStorage`` storage backend in the
        ``django-storages`` app.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        - Use your favorite Python packaging tool to install ``uploadstatic``
          from `PyPI`_, e.g.::
        
            pip install django-uploadstatic
        
        - Added ``"uploadstatic"`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting::
        
            INSTALLED_APPS = [
                # ...
                "uploadstatic",
            ]
        
        - Set your ``STATIC_URL`` setting to the URL that handles serving
          static files from S3::
        
            STATIC_URL = "https://s3.amazonaws.com/some-domain/"
        
        - Once you are ready to upload all static files that have been collecte in your
          site's ``STATIC_ROOT``, use the ``uploadstatic`` management
          command::
        
            python manage.py uploadstatic
        
          Then your files will be accessible from the ``STATIC_URL`` setting.
