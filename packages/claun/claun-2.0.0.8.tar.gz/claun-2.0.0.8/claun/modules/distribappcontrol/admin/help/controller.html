==================

Description
-----------

Controller configuration is stored in **couchDB** as a JSON document.
By using the administration form, you can let the server create the document
for you.

A full example controller document can be seen in the controller.json_
file. Every controller configuration has its own document. Some fields in the
document are generated by the server. They are described in the appropriate
module.

Form fields
----------------

The fields in the **application** form are:
  - **Controller Name** - You can name the controller whatever you want, but
    remember that the name is used during the startup process to automatically
    detect the appropriate builder and runner. You should choose lowercase names
    with no spaces and special characters. (mandatory)
  - **Name** - Name of the configuration. Same rules as for the framework name
    apply(mandatory)

  - **Parameters** - JSON string with list of key-value records. It is used to
    generate controller configuration and is controller dependent.

Example configurations
-----------------------------

Take the contents of the **parameters** attribute (with the parentheses) and
paste it into the Parameters field.
