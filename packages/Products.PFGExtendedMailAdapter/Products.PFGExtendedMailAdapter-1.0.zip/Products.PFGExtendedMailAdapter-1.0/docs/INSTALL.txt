Installation
============

Use zc.buildout and the plone.recipe.zope2instance
recipe to manage packages:


* Add ``Products.PFGExtendedMailAdapter`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.::

    [buildout]
    eggs =
        Products.PFGExtendedMailAdapter

* Tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug::

    [instance]
    recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
    zcml =
        Products.PFGExtendedMailAdapter

* Re-run buildout, e.g. with::

    $ ./bin/buildout

* Then Quick Install ``Products.PloneFormGen`` first before installing ``Products.PFGExtendedMailAdapter``.
