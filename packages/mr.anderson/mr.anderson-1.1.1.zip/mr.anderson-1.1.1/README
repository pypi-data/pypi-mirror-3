===========

A commandline utility for building Plone testing instances. It was created
to aid in automated testing of packages in the Plone landscape.

This package provides a script called ``redpill``. The script is used to
create a Plone configuration. See ``redpill --help`` for more information.

Using ``redpill`` without any options will create configuration for the latest
released version of Plone 4.
