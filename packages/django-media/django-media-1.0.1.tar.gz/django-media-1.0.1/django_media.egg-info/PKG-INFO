Description: django-media
        ============
        
        A reusable [Django](http://www.djangoproject.com/) application to store and manage media. This application was originally created by [Nathan Borror](http://nathanborror.com/) for [django-basic-apps](https://github.com/nathanborror/django-basic-apps), his collection of simple prebuilt Django applications.
        
        
        How it Works
        ------------
        
        Models are included for storing audio, photos, and video, as well as sets of these three objects. URLs (using generic views) and templates are included for displaying these objects.
        
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        * [Python Imaging Library](http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/) is required for getting photo EXIF data.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        django-media is available on PyPI and can be installed with PIP.
        
            pip install django-media
        
        Alternatively, you may download the source and install it.
        
            python setup.py install
        
        
        
        
        Setup
        -----
        
        Add `media` to your `settings.INSTALLED_APPS`.
        
        
        ### URLs
        
        If you wish to use the default URL structure, you may do so by adding them to your project's URL patterns. For example:
        
            urlpatterns = patterns('',
                ...
                (r'^photos/', include('media.urls.photos')),
