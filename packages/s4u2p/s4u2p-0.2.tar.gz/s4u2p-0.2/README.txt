This Python package is a high-level wrapper for the impersonation Kerberos (GSSAPI) operations.

Most of the code is based on the kerberos 1.1.1 python package
and from http://k5wiki.kerberos.org/wiki/Projects/Services4User.

TESTING
=======

For a setup read this:

http://k5wiki.kerberos.org/wiki/Manual_Testing#Services4User_testing  (*)

(n.b.: i had to include the REALM in the upn of the computer account)

To test the whole thing i created a simple website "username" which when called simply replies with a Hello <authenticated user>.
It is deployed on an IIS 7.5 webserver with windows authentication enabled as the only authentication method.

So i have the following parts:

The website i visit as an impersonated user: http://webserver/username/
A service principalname, which is created with IIS installation (otherwise use setspn.exe): http@webserver  (or http/webserver.fqdn)
The server keytab file which contains the keys of the computeraccount as created in (*): server.keytab
The upn of the computeraccount: host/server.fqdn
The (kerberos) user i want to impersonate: otheruser

With that i do:

1) kinit -kt ./server.keytab host/server.fqdn
2) PYTHONPATH=build/lib.xxx python test.py --user otheruser --host webserver --servicename HTTP@webserver --path /username/ --keytab ./server.keytab
