Description: MegamanicEdit is a tool which enables constructing objects where
        fields are "dynamic", for example in GrailTact, a user can add several
        Email objects, and these are treated as regular fields when editing
        the container (Contact) object.
        
        It also enables adding objects from a template, so for example leads
        interested in something can be greated from a landing page (see
        GrailTact also here).
        
        Thanks to Bluedynamics' AtMultiEdit for giving a good example.
        
        Portions of the templates/skins are taken from the Archetypes
        product, which is

        Use the 'Add portal content' permission for all project content types,
        so that it integrates nicely with the megamanic template object class.
