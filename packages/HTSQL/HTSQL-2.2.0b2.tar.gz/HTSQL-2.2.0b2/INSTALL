Installation Instructions
=========================

Download HTSQL source code::

    $ hg clone http://bitbucket.org/prometheus/htsql

Build and install HTSQL::

    $ cd htsql
    $ make build
    # make install

Installing HTSQL creates a ``htsql-ctl`` script.  For general help and
a list of commands, run::

    $ htsql-ctl help

To start a command-line HTSQL shell, run::

    $ htsql-ctl shell DBURI

To start an HTTP server running HTSQL, run::

    $ htsql-ctl server DBURI [HOST [PORT]]

Here, ``DBURI`` specifies how to connect to the database and must have
the form::

    ENGINE://USER:PASS@HOST:PORT/DATABASE
