        =========================
        
        Simple Markdown plugin is just an simple markdown plugin for django-cms.
        It's brutally simple. Just a text area and you'll entered some markdown text and save it.
        And the reason why i make this is that, I really couldn't find any simple as stupid plugin
        for django-cms, all i've found was fancy with alot of java script stuff.

        Drama story
        ===========
        Since every application won't begins with love, this plugin developed to solve a problem.
        2 days back, i was using **cms.plugin.text** for handling html pages and stuff, but when i try to use aws s3/cloudfront
        for my static files, i've stuck with CORS problem.
        So i've develop cmsplugin-simple-markdown to be used without any deps on js/css files.
