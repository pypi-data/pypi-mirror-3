    Ever had to speak to an OAuth 2.0 protected
    resource for debugging purposes?  curl is a
    nice tool, but it totally lacks helpers for
    dealing with oauth.

    curlish comes for the rescue.  It has can
    remember access tokens for you and inject it
    into requests.

    Facebook is preconfigured so that you can dive
    into testing it:

    $ curlish https://graph.facebook.com/me

    To add more sites you can directly modify the
    config file which is located, conveniently
    in ~/.ftcurlish.json

    Requirements: Python 2.6 or higher.

    Full automated installation:

    $ curl -L http://bit.ly/curlish | bash

    Installs curlish into ~/.bin for you.

    (If you want to know what it executes, have a
    look at the install.sh file in this repo)
