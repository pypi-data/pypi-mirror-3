        How to install
        ==============
        
        Simply add ``auslfe.formonline.tokenaccess`` to your buildout::
        
        [instance]
        recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
        ...
        eggs =
        Plone
        ...
        auslfe.formonline.pfgadapter
        auslfe.formonline.tokenaccess
        
        How to use
        ==========
        
        ``auslfe.formonline.pfgadapter`` (version 0.4 or better) already check your Zope installation looking for
        ``auslfe.formonline.tokenaccess``. If it is found you'll get some new features:
        
        * The "*Overseer e-mail*" can also not be an internal e-mail (a new check option in the PFG adapter
        "*Overseer must be a site member*" will be found).
        * An external overseer can now access a special site's page, where he can see the sent form and approve it.
        
        The overseer will receive the common confirmation e-mail with a special link that show the document (even if
        in not accessible state). Note that **this link is permanently valid**.
        From this view other two links are shown, one for approve and another for reject the document.
        
        **Please note** that the e-mail sent to the external overseer is a clean way to bypass Plone security. If
        this e-mail and data inside is used by a malicous user, he will be able to see reserver data and approve it.
