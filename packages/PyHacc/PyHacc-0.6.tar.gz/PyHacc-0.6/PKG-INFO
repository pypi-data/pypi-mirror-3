Description: Pre-requisites
        --------------
        
        You will need python (2.6 and 2.7 are tested), qtalchemy, sqlalchemy (0.7x 
        preferred), a python database driver, and PyQt4 or PySide.  Refer to setup.py 
        for a more complete list of dependencies.
        
        It should be noted that while PyHacc is a fully functional system which is in
        production use for the author's personal use, it is primarily a demonstration
        and example of qtalchemy -- http://qtalchemy.org .
        
        PyHacc can be run on both PyQt4 and PySide.  In the root of the mercurial 
        repository, run the script qtbindings to switch between the two.  The source 
        comes set up for PyQt4, but you can switch to PySide with::
        
            python qtbindings.py --platform=PySide
            python setup.py build
            sudo python setup.py install
        
        If using PySide, the qtalchemy library will also need to be switched to 
        using PySide in a similar way.
        
        
        Getting Started
        ---------------
        
        On linux, it should be sufficient to run::
        
            python setup.py build
            sudo python setup.py install
            pyhaccgui --conn=sqlite://
        
        The sqlite:// connection string will start pyhacc with a demo database.
        
        It is recommended and most tested to use pyhacc with postgresql.  To initialize 
        a database::
        
            createdb pyhacc
            pyhacc initdb postgresql://username:password@localhost/pyhacc
            # to run pyhacc connected to this database:
            pyhaccgui --conn=postgresql://username:password@localhost/pyhacc
        
        Getting Started on Windows
        --------------------------
        
        Roughly speaking, the install proceeds as follows:
        
        - Install python and easy_install
        - Install PyQt (or PySide, if desired).
        - easy_install sqlalchemy
        - easy_install pyscopg2  # for postgresql support
        - easy_install pyhacc
        
        On your postgresql server, run the following command::
        
            createdb pyhacc
        
        Initialize the data-set with the following command on the windows client::
        
            c:\python27\python.exe c:\python27\scripts\pyhacc initdb postgresql://username:password@server/pyhacc
        
        Create a windows short-cut with the following target for starting the program::
        
            c:\python27\pythonw.exe c:\python27\scripts\pyhaccgui --conn=postgresql://username:password@server/pyhacc
