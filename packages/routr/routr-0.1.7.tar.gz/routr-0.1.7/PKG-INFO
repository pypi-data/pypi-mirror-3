          from routr import route, GET, POST
          from routr.schema import form, String
        
          routes = route("/users",
            route(POST, "/",          "views.create_user", guards=[form(username=String)]),
            route(GET,  "/{id:int}",  "views.get_user"))

        0.1.7
        -----
        
        * [bugfix] incorrect reversal of urls with more than one param
        
        0.1.6
        -----
        
        * [bugfix] fix bug with RouteGuarded poped up in RouteGroup match
        
        * add '_' to allowed args in URLPattern
        
        0.1.5
        -----
        
        * introduced RequestParams.exception_factory which abstracts away
          HTTPBadRequest raise in case of invalid data being supplied
        
        * [bugfix] RouteGuarded.response now installed correctly, previously it
          sometimes contained NoUrlMatched objects which are not responses
        
        0.1.4
        -----
        
        * RequestParams.post_processor now also can be accumulated via addition
        
        * fix bug in RequestParams which prevented Option wrap SchemaNode objects
          directly
        
        0.1.3
        -----
        
        * fix broken 0.1.2 release by including CHANGES file in dist
        
        0.1.2
        -----
        
        * trace factory made configurable via Configuration.trace attribute
        
        * method and PATH_INFO extraction delegated to configuration, allows
          implementing routing for other request wrapper (werkzeug or django's request
          for example)
        
        * routes now have access to configuration object via ``cfg`` attribute
        
        0.1.1
        -----
        
        * allow guards return None (routing doesn't break on this and proceed with old
          trace)
        
        * RequestParams now can accept colander.SchemaNode directly (allows to supply
          validators)
        
        0.1
        ---
        
        * initial release
