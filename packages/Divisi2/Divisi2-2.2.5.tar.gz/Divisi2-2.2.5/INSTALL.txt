On a Debian system, the following commands should suffice to install Divisi:

    sudo aptitude install python-dev python-numpy
    ./setup.py build
    sudo ./setup.py install

Older Debian systems may require the 'python-numpy-dev' package also.

We support Python 2.5 and 2.6.

For a local installation (i.e., not system-wide), do instead:

    ./setup.py develop
