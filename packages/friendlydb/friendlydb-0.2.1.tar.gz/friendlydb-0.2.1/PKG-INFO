        FriendlyDB
        ==========
        
        ``friendlydb`` is a small & fast following/followers database written in
        Python. It can be either used directly from your Python code or over HTTP
        with small web API.
        
        FriendlyDB isn't meant to be a full user system; it should be used to augment
        an existing system to track relationships.
        
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Using FriendlyDB from Python looks like::
        
            from friendlydb.db import FriendlyDB
        
            # Give Friendly a directory to work in.
            fdb = FriendlyDB('/usr/data/friendly')
        
            # Grab a user by their username.
            daniel = fdb['daniel']
        
            # Follow a couple users.
            daniel.follow('alice')
            daniel.follow('bob')
            daniel.follow('joe')
        
            # Check the following.
            daniel.following()
            # Returns:
            # [
            #     'alice',
            #     'bob',
            #     'joe',
            # ]
        
            # Check joe's followers.
            fdb['joe'].followers()
            # Returns:
            # [
            #     'daniel',
            # ]
        
            # Unfollow.
            daniel.unfollow('bob')
        
            # Check the following.
            daniel.following()
            # Returns:
            # [
            #     'alice',
            #     'joe',
            # ]
        
            # Dust off & nuke everything from orbit.
            fdb.clear()
        
        Using FriendlyDB from HTTP looks like::

        Requirements
        ============
        
        * Python 2.6+
        * (Optional) gevent for the HTTP server
        * (Optional) unittest2 for running tests
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Using pip, you can install it with ``pip install friendlydb``.
        
        
        Running Tests
        =============
        
        ``friendlydb`` is maintained with passing tests at all times. Simply run::
        
            python -m unittest2 tests
        
        
        Contributions
        =============
        
        In order for a contribution to be considered for merging, it must meet the
        following requirements:
        
        * Patch cleanly solves the problem
        * Added test coverage (now passing) to expose the bug & check for regression
        * If the behavior affects end-users, there must be docs on the changes
        * The patch/tests must be compatibly licensed with New BSD
        
        The best way to submit contributions is by forking the project on Github,
        applying your changes *on a new branch*, pushing those changes back to GH &
        submitting a pull request through the GitHub interface.
