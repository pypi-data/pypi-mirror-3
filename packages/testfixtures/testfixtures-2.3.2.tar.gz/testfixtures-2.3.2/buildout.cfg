# This buildout is used for development of testfixtures.
# It gets the necessary eggs and creates a test runner and a python
# interpreter.

# To set up an environment suitable for doing development work on
# testfixtures, do the following:
# 
# python bootstrap.py 
# bin/buildout

# Tests can be run with:
#
# bin/test

# A python environment with testfixtures available can be started using:
#
# bin/py
