        ***********
        
        Introduction
        ============
        
        This library packages `jQuery UI`_ for `fanstatic`_. It is aware of different modes (normal, minified).
        
        .. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
        .. _`jQuery UI`: http://jqueryui.com
        
        This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
        and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
        directory in ``js.jqueryui``) are published to some URL.
        
        How to use?
        ===========
        
        You can import jQuery UI from ``js.jqueryui`` and ``need`` it
        where you want these resources to be included on a page::
        
          >>> from js.jqueryui import jqueryui
          >>> jqueryui.need()
        
        Themes
        ------
        
        The themes in the jQuery UI themes distribution are included as well::
        
          >>> from js.jqueryui import black_tie
          >>> black_tie.need()
