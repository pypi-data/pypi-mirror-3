Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        ``collective.pluggablelogin`` overrides the standard Plone login form
        with a template using a portlet manager, so that various login
        components can be configured.

        Configuration
        -------------
        
        Go to the Addons control panel and activate "Pluggable Login Page."
        
        Now if you go to /login while logged in as a Manager, you'll see a
        "Manage portlets" link which you can use to manage the available
        login portlets. By default the standard login portlet and a
        registration form portlet are enabled (the latter is only shown
        if self registration is enabled for the site).
