        A Sphinx_ extension to reference issues in issue trackers, either explicitly
        with an "issue" role or optionally implicitly by issue ids like ``#10`` in
        plaintext.
        
        Currently the following issue trackers are supported:
        
        - `GitHub <http://github.com>`_
        - `BitBucket <http://bitbucket.org>`_
        - `Launchpad <https://launchpad.net>`_
        - `Google Code <http://code.google.com>`_
        - `Debian BTS <http://bugs.debian.org>`_
        - `Jira <http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/>`_
        
        A simple API is provided to add support for other issue trackers.  If you added
        support for a new tracker, please consider sending a patch to make your work
        available to other users of this extension.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        This extension can be installed from the Python Package Index::
        
           pip install sphinxcontrib-issuetracker
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Just add this extension to ``extensions`` and configure your issue tracker::
        
           extensions = ['sphinxcontrib.issuetracker']
        
           issuetracker = 'github'
           issuetracker_project = 'lunaryorn/sphinxcontrib-issuetracker'
        
        Now issue references like ``#10`` are replaced with links to the issue tracker
        of this extension, unless the reference occurs in literal text like inline
        literals or code blocks.
        
        You can disable this magic behaviour by setting issuetracker_plaintext_issues
        to ``False``::
        
           issuetracker_plaintext_issues = False
        
        Now textual references are no longer replaced. However, you can still explicitly
        reference issues with the ``issue`` role.
