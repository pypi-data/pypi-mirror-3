Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This package provides information about the host you are running buildout on.
        
        
        Exposed Parameters
        ==================
        
        hostname
        The hostname of the machine buildout is running on, as returned by ``socket.gethostname()``
        fqdn
        The fully qualified domain of the machine buildout is running on, as return by ``socket.getfqdn()``.
        If no fqdn is available, this will be the same as hostname.
        interface.X.address
        The IP address of the network interface ``X``.
        user.name
        The name of the account running buildout
        user.uid
        The uid running buildout. Numerical.
        user.gid
        The gid running buildout. Numerical.
        user.home
        The home directory of the user running buildout
        vcs.type
        The type of checkout that buildout is being run from. Supports Git or SVN, otherwise will be 'unknown'.
        vcs.branch
        The branch or that that buildout is being run from. Will be 'unknown' for unsupported VCS.
        
        
        Using facts
        ===========
        
        This example uses the missingbits echo recipe to print information about the current machine::
        
        [buildout]
        parts = echo
        
        [facts]
        recipe = isotoma.recipe.facts
        
        [echo]
        recipe = missingbits:echo
        echo =
        The hostname is ${facts:hostname}
        The fdqn is ${facts:fdqn}
        The main IP address is ${facts:interface.eth0.address}
        The VCS type is ${facts:vcs.type} and branch is ${facts:vcs.branch}
        The user is ${facts:user.name} and their home dir is ${facts:user.home}
