Description: ==========================
        isotoma.buildout.basicauth
        ==========================
        
        This buildout extension allows your buildouts to use ``${buildout:extends}`` or
        eggs that are protected by basic auth. The minimum configuration::
        
            [buildout]
            extensions = isotoma.buildout.basicauth
        
        Any downloads that require basic auth will now prompt for a username and
        password. It will be stored in a secure keyring if one is available. If your
        credentials are in .pypirc they will be detected and used.
        
        You can provide credentials to the extension via builout, for non-interactive
        situations. For example::
        
            [basicauth]
            credentials =
                github
            interactive = no
        
            [github]
            uri = https://raw.github.com/
            username = user
            password = chunky
        
        Each of the credentials parts provides authentication details for a different
        uri. The part must contain a uri, user and password to be used by the
        extension.
        
        The "interactive" option determines whether or not fetcher methods can prompt
        the user for input.
