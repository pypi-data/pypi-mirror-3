    Parameters
    ----------
    array : ndarray
        input. Any dimension is supported
    sigma : scalar or sequence of scalars
        standard deviation for Gaussian kernel. The standard

        The order of the filter along each axis is given as a sequence
        of integers, or as a single number.  An order of 0 corresponds

        corresponds to convolution with the first, second or third
        derivatives of a Gaussian. Higher order derivatives are not
        implemented

    Returns
    -------
    filtered : ndarray
        Filtered version of `array`

    Notes
    -----
    The multi-dimensional filter is implemented as a sequence of
    one-dimensional convolution filters. The intermediate arrays are
    stored in the same data type as the output. Therefore, for output
    types with a limited precision, the results may be imprecise
    because intermediate results may be stored with insufficient
    precision.
