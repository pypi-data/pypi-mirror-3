Changelog
=========

2.0b2 (2012-08-31)
------------------

- Item count attribute added to control the number of items in a batch.
  [timo]

- BBB methods added to collection class.
  [timo]

- Remove code to remove the ATContentTypes 'Topic' type since this type is not
  present in Plone 4.2 any longer.

2.0b1 (2012-03-09)
------------------

- Remove archetypes-based Topic content type on install.
  [timo]

- Do not hide sort_on and sort_reversed on the field level, since this will
  break the JS code for sorting in plone.formwidget.querystring. At some
  point we have to refactor the code to make plone.formwidget.querystring use
  z3c.form only for sorting.
  [timo]


2.0a1 (2011-11-13)
------------------
