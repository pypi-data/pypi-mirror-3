2.7.3.5 - 2012-05-09
--------------------

- Now always cleans up after ``sys.exc_info()`` to avoid
  cyclic references.

- ExceptionInfo without arguments now defaults to ``sys.exc_info``.

- Forking can now be disabled using the
  ``MULTIPROCESSING_FORKING_DISABLE`` environment variable.

    Also this envvar is set so that the behavior is inherited
    after execv.

- The semaphore cleanup process started when execv is used
  now sets a useful process name if the ``setproctitle``
  module is installed.

- Sets the ``FORKED_BY_MULTIPROCESSING``
  environment variable if forking is disabled.


2.7.3.4 - 2012-04-27
--------------------

- Added `billiard.ensure_multiprocessing()`

    Raises NotImplementedError if the platform does not support
    multiprocessing (e.g. Jython).


2.7.3.3 - 2012-04-23
--------------------

- PyPy now falls back to using its internal _multiprocessing module,
  so everything works except for forking_enable(False) (which
  silently degrades).

- Fixed Python 2.5 compat issues.

- Uses more with statements

- Merged some of the changes from the Python 3 branch.

2.7.3.2 - 2012-04-20
--------------------

- Now installs on PyPy/Jython (but does not work).

2.7.3.1 - 2012-04-20
--------------------

- Python 2.5 support added.

2.7.3.0 - 2012-04-20
--------------------

- Updated from Python 2.7.3

- Python 2.4 support removed, now only supports 2.5, 2.6 and 2.7.
  (may consider py3k support at some point).

- Pool improvments from Celery.

- no-execv patch added (http://bugs.python.org/issue8713)
