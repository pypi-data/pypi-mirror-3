Description: Django Shop BulkForm plugin
        ============================
        
        All this plugin does is give you access to a "bulk" order form that
        lists all the products in your site with quantity boxes and adds
        them to the cart on submission. Not rocket science.
        
        It also may not work for every shop. If you have more than 25 or so
        items, a page that lists them all could get unwieldy. But if you
        only have a small number of items and want an easy view to let
        people add multiple products at the same time, this is your plugin.
