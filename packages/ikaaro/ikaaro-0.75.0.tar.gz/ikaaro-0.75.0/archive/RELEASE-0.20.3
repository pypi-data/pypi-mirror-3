ikaaro 0.20.3 (2008/02/06)
==========================

This is a Content Management System built on Python & itools, among
other features ikaaro provides:

 - content and document management (index&search, metadata, etc.)
 - multilingual user interfaces and content
 - high level modules: wiki, forum, tracker, etc.

This release brings an important usability improvement for the Wiki,
which now has a toolbar, so understanding of the ReST language is not
required for the simple and common tasks.

Also, many bugs have been fixed, including #245, #246, #248 and #253.
