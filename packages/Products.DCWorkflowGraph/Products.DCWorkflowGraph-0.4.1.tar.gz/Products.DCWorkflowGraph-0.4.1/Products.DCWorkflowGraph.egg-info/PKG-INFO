        DCWorkflowGraph
        ---------------
        
            DCWorkflowGraph is a DCWorkflow graphic viewer now. It uses Graphviz. 
            I want to make it a graphic editor for DCWorkflow, just like what
            OpenFlowEditor does.
        
            DCWorkflowGraph is at the collective: http://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/Products.DCWorkflowGraph
        
            Product home: http://www.zope.org/Members/panjunyong/DCWorkflowGraph
        
        Requires

        Install

        How to use it
        =============
        
            Go to ZMI portal_workflow/your_workflow, there is a new tab called
            'graph', click it and you will see the workflow graph!
