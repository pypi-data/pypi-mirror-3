Osmium for Python
=================

This is a Python port of the Osmium (http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Osmium) library,
which provides a fast and flexible toolkit for working with Open Street Map data.

Currently only a small subset of the Osmium toolkit is implement. You can read
and write OSM files in different formats and process them through a customized
filter.

Please have a look at http://bitbucket.org/jokoala/pyosmium/wiki/Home for
examples and (an approximation to) documentation.
