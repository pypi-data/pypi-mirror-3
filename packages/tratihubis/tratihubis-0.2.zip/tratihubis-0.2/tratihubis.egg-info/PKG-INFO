Description: 
        Tratihubis converts Trac tickets to Github issues by using the following steps:
        
        1. The user manually exports the Trac tickets to convert to a CSV file.
        2. Tratihubis reads the CSV file and uses the data to create Github issues and milestones.
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        To install tratihubis, use ``pip`` or ``easy_install``::
        
          $ pip install tratihubis
        
        If needed, this also installs the `PyGithub <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyGithub/>`_ package.
        
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Information about Trac tickets to convert has to be provided in a CSV file. To obtain this CSV file, create a
        new Trac query using the SQL statement stored in
        `query_tickets.sql <https://github.com/roskakori/tratihubis/blob/master/query_tickets.sql>`_ and saving the
        result by clicking "Download in other formats: Comma-delimited Text" and choosing for example
        ``/Users/me/mytool/tickets.csv`` as output file.
        
        Next create a config file to describe how to login to Github and what to convert. For example, you could
        store the following in ``~/mytool/tratihubis.cfg``::
        
          [tratihubis]
          user = someone
          password = secret
          repo = mytool
          tickets = /Users/me/mytool/tickets.csv
        
        Then run::
        
          $ tratihubis ~/mytool/tratihubis.cfg
        
        This tests that the input data and Github information is valid and writes a log to the console describing
        which operations would be performed.
        
        To actually create the Github issues, you need to enable to command line option ``--really``::
        
          $ tratihubis --really ~/mytool/tratihubis.cfg
        
        Be aware that Github issues and milestones cannot be deleted in case you mess up. Your only remedy is to
        remove the whole repository and start anew. So make sure that tratihubis does what you want before you
        enable ``--really``.
        
        In case the Trac users have different user names on Github, you can specify a mapping. For example::
        
           users = johndoe: jdoe78, *: me
        
        This would map the Trac user ``johndoe`` to the Github user ``jdoe78`` and everyone else to the user ``me``.
        The default value is::
        
          users = *:*
        
        This maps every Trac user to a Github user with the same name.
        
        
        Limitations
        ===========
        
        Currently tratihubis only converts tickets with their descriptions and milestones. It also creates
        milestones as needed.
        
        Github issues get the same owner as the Trac ticket. This only works if the Trac user has the same name on
        Github. If this is not the case, manually edit the ``owner`` and ``reporter`` columns in the tickets CSV.
        
        The following information is not converted:
        
        * Github issues remain open even if the Trac ticket has been closed.
        * Trac comments are discarded instead of converted to Github comments.
        * Trac ticket details on type and resolution are discarded instead of converted to Github labels.
        * Trac Wiki markup remains instead of being converted to Github Markdown.
        
        If you want to implement any of these features, create a fork and open a pull request at
