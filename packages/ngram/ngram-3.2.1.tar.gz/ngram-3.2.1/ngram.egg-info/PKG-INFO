Description: to search for set members ranked by their N-Gram string similarity
        to the query. There are also methods for comparing a pair of strings.
        
        There is [documentation][1] and a [tutorial][2].
        
        How does it work?
        =================
        
        The set stores arbitrary items by using a specified "key" function
        to produce a string representation of set members suitable for N-gram indexing.
        By default it simply calls str() on the objects.
        
        The N-grams are obtained by splitting strings into overlapping substrings
        of N (usually N=3) characters in length and association is maintained from
        each distinct N-Gram to items that use it.
        
        To find items similar to a query string, it splits the query into N-grams,
        collects all items sharing at least one N-gram with the query,
        and ranks the items by score based on the ratio of shared to unshared
        N-grams between strings.
        
        History
        =======
        
        In 2007, Michel Albert (exhuma) wrote the python-ngram module based on Perl's
        [String::Trigram][3] module by Tarek Ahmed, and committed the code for 2.0.0b2 to
        Sourceforge subversion repo.
        
        Since late 2008 python-ngram development has been continued Graham Poulter,
        adding features, documentation, performance improvements and Python 3 support.
        The repo was first moved to Mercurial repo on Google Code, but primary
        development now takes place here on GitHub.
