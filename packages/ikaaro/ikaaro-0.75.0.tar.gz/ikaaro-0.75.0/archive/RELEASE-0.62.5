ikaaro 0.62.5 (2011/01/10)
==========================

This is a Content Management System built on Python & itools, among
other features ikaaro provides:

 - content and document management (index&search, metadata, etc.)
 - multilingual user interfaces and content
 - high level modules: wiki, forum, tracker, etc.

Changes
-------

Now the blog, the calendar and the tracker are not enabled by default,
use the 'modules' variable in the 'config.conf' file to enable them:

  modules = ikaaro.blog ikaaro.calendar ikaaro.tracker

There have been several fixes related to restedit [1], like bug #1026,
and now restedit version 1.1.1 or later is required.

There have been several user interface improvements. Most notably now
it is possible to select where a new resource will be added from the
add form, with the help of a select box (see bug #1102). Also, TinyMCE
has been upgraded from 3.3.8 to 3.3.9.2

The icms-update.py script has a new option, --mtime, it will set the
mtime/last_author fields after inspection of the Git history.

At the API level, the 'register_document_type' function has changed a
little, now the second parameter identifies the container class where
the given document type can be added, and not its parent class. See
the upgrade notes for examples.

Other issues resolved include:

  #712 Tracker: add access control filter to the "Stored Searches" menu
 #1024 The documentation has been updated
 #1063 Fix the search-by-type select box in the pop-up
 #1087 Improve error message when trying to remove referenced resources
