This app is intended to make it easier to add TIGER/Line data to a GeoDjango project and save people from writing this same code over and over (collectively).

It is not (yet) exhaustive, it's just what I had and have needed in the past.
If you have models / load scripts for other data in the set, please fork/add and send me a pull request if you add other shapefiles. If you come up with useful manager methods, I'd love to see those too.

*NOTE: If you need cities, the best source for that is the US National Atlas. I have an app for those at https://github.com/adamfast/usgsdata-citiesx020

It's been tested and used with Django 1.1 to 1.4 and PostGIS + PostgreSQL. ORM freezing South
migrations are included as well, I'm currently using the 0.7.3 version.

Install
-------

Download the 2010 Tigerline files for all zipcodes, all states, and all counties

http://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/geo/shapefiles2010/main

* Zipcode Tabulation Areas (for all states)
* States (and Equivalents) (for all states)
* Counties (and Equivalents) (for all states)

Unzip the files

Configure django.contrib.gis as described in the django docs.

Add "django.contrib.gis" and "tigerline" to INSTALLED_APPS

run `python manage.py syncdb` or `python manage.py migrate` as approporiate

If you want to import all three:
run `python manage.py load_tigerline --path=~/Path/to/shapefiles`

Or there are individual management commands if you only need one set:
run `python manage.py load_counties --path=~/Path/to/shapefiles`
run `python manage.py load_states --path=~/Path/to/shapefiles`
run `python manage.py load_zipcodes --path=~/Path/to/shapefiles`
