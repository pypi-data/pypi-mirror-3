Description: A library for comparing trees of various objects
                    in a way that yields useful "paths" to each difference. Simply
                    knowing that two object blobs differ is hardly useful without
                    knowing where exactly the differences are located. For text
                    blobs, text-diff utilities can solve this problem, but they are
                    ill suited for dealing with arbitrary data structures such as
                    dictionaries where key order doesn't matter.
