.. class:: Tie(tievalue='start')

    Object added to notes that are tied to other notes. The `type` value is one of start, stop, or continue.



    >>> from music21 import *
    >>> note1 = note.Note()
    >>> note1.tie = tie.Tie("start")
    >>> note1.tie.style = "normal" # default; could also be "dotted" or "dashed" or "hidden"
    >>> note1.tie.type
    'start'
    >>> note1.tie
    <music21.tie.Tie start>


    Differences from MusicXML:
       notes do not need to know if they are tied from a
       previous note.  i.e., you can tie n1 to n2 just with
       a tie start on n1.  However, if you want proper musicXML output
       you need a tie stop on n2
       one tie with "continue" implies tied from and tied to


       optional (to know what notes are next:)
          .to = note()   # not implimented yet, b/c of garbage coll.
          .from = note()
