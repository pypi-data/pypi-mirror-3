Goals
=====

* Allow for an age range to accompany each level.
* Have a specific order
* Be able to convert a range of grades (and ages) into a human-readable string (e.g. '4-6', '6 and under')
* Age ranges must allow for no lower and no upper boundaries

Introduction

A grade is a level of study or achievement within a subject area or educational institution. Grade metadata is meant to indicate that the related object is appropriate for the related grade levels.
