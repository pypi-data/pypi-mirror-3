History
=======

0.2.4 - 2011-11-13
------------------

- Adjust for Pyramid 1.2: INI file updates, switch to pyramid_tm. (MO)

- Add Kotti Demo source and documentation.

0.2.3 - 2011-10-28
------------------

- ``Node.__getitem__`` will now also accept a tuple as key.

  ``folder['1', '2']`` is the same as ``folder['1']['2']``, just more
  efficient.

- Added a new cache decorator based on ``repoze.lru``.

0.2.2 - 2011-10-10
------------------

- Change the function signature of ``kotti.authn_policy_factory``,
  ``kotti.authz_policy_factory`` and ``kotti.session_factory`` to
  include all settings from the configuration file.

0.2.1 - 2011-09-29
------------------

- Minor changes to events setup code to ease usage in tests.

0.2 - 2011-09-16
----------------

- No changes.

0.2a2 - 2011-09-05
------------------

- Fix templates to be compatible with Chameleon 2.  Also, require
  Chameleon>=2.

- Require pyramid>=1.2.  Also, enable pyramid_debugtoolbar for
  ``development.ini`` profile.

0.2a1 - 2011-08-29
------------------

- Improve database schema for ``Nodes``.  Split ``Node`` class into
  ``Node`` and ``Content``.

  This change is backward incompatible in that existing content types
  in your code will need to subclass ``Content`` instead of ``Node``.
  The example in the docs has been updated.  Also, the underlying
  database schema has changed.

- Improve user database hashing and local roles storage.

- Compatibility fix for Pyramid 1.2.

0.1.1 - 2011-05-17
------------------

- Fix an installation issue with ``colander`` and ``dependency_links``.

0.1 - 2011-05-04
----------------

- Add persistent settings, which allow the overriding of registry
  settings and carry along with them the version of the last update.

0.1a9 - 2011-04-12
------------------

- Add 'in_navigation' flag for all Nodes to control whether or not it
  appears in the navigation.

- Improvements related to writing add-ons.

0.1a8 - 2011-03-18
------------------

- Add slots/portlets through which third party packages can extend
  Kotti and put fragments of markup into the site's HTML.  Look at the
  ``kotti.views.slots`` for documentation.

- Enable AJAX forms in the Move screen and add Growl-like notification
  for messages.

- Fixed silly packaging problem with 0.1a7 release.  Install would
  fail with ``README.rst: No such file or directory`` before.

- Fix bug with TinyMCE which would trigger "Are you sure you want to
  leave this page?" all the time.

0.1a7
-----

- Add a user management screen for adding new users and assigning them
  to roles and groups globally.  Allow new users to set their own
  passwords.

- Add "forgotten password" button to login screen; sends an e-mail
  with a reset password link.

- Add a simple user preferences screen.

- Ditch 'kotti.configuration' in favour of 'pyramid.settings'.

0.1a6
-----

- Kotti now has a 100% automated test coverage, testing a total of
  some 950 lines of code.

- Add a user dropdown menu in the edit interface that display's the
  currently logged in user's name and contains links to Site Setup (in
  the works) and Logout.

- Require Chameleon < 1.2.999 since higher version cause compatibility
  issues with ``pyramid`` and ``deform``.

- Implemented a simple events system in ``kotti.events`` that's akin
  to Zope3's object events.  See the module for documentation and
  examples.

- Add a ``request_cache`` cache decorator in ``kotti.util`` for
  memoizing function results in the current request.  Cut down number
  of recursive queries run by ``kotti.security.list_groups_ext``.

0.1a5
-----

- Add sharing screen.

  This allows you to set roles for groups and users on individual
  folders.  This also considers roles that are inherited from higher
  up in the hierarchy, and those that are inherited from groups that
  the user belongs to.

- Refined available system roles in ``kotti.security.ROLES``.  We now
  have:

  - Viewer: view
  - Editor: view, add, edit
  - Owner: view, add, edit, manage
  - Admin: all permissions

0.1a4
-----

- Added login form.

  With the development profile in ``development.ini``, log in with
  user 'admin' and password 'qwerty'.  User management and sharing tab
  is a TODO.

- Add a default user database implementation in
  ``kotti.security.Principals``.
  
  Override with ``kotti.principals`` configuration setting.

- Add inheritbale, nested groups support.
  
  Groups are stored in ``Node.__groups__``.  The API is
  ``kotti.security.list_groups`` and ``kotti.security.set_groups``.
