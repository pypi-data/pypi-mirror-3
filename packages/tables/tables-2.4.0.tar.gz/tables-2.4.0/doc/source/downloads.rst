Stable Versions
---------------

The stable versions of PyTables can be downloaded from the file `download
area`_ on SourceForge.net.

Windows binaries can be obtained from many different distributions, like
`Python(x,y)`_, ActiveState_, or Enthought_.
In addition, Christoph Gohlke normally does an excellent job by providing
binaries for many interesting software on his
`website <http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/>`_.

You may be interested to easy_install the latest released stable version::

    $ easy_install tables

Or, you may prefer to install the stable version in Git repository instead
using :program:`pip`. For example, for the stable 2.3 series, you can do::

    $ pip install --install-option='--prefix=<PREFIX>' \
    -e git+https://github.com/PyTables/PyTables.git@v.2.3#egg=tables
