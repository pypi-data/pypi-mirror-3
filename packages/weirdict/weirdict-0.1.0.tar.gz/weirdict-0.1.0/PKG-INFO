        weirdict
        ========
        
        This package offers a base implementation as well as several examples of
        "normalized dicts".
        
        A normalized dict is a python dictionary subclass whose keys are normalized
        through a particular function prior to insertion/modification/deletion.
        
        
        Examples
        ========
        
        The example classes provided include:
        
        * A case-insensitive dict,
        
        * a dict whose keys are truncated to a given length,
        
        * a dict whose keys are computed modulo N, where N is a given int.
