v0.2, 2012-04-22
    * API now returns all the payment options with the corresponding prices for
      each store product.
v0.1.10, 2012-03-24
    * API now checks and optimizes the product types given by the client in the
      "products" and "product_urls_and_types" methods using the types the given
      scrapper handle
v0.1.9, 2012-03-23
    * Improved logging behavior under sync and async environments
v0.1.8, 2012-03-22
    * Scrapping scripts must now provide the product types they can handle,
      this simplifies the calling of the most common methods of the API.
    * Included scrapping scripts now follow the requirement above.
v0.1.7, 2012-03-17
    * Changed signature of the store.products method. It now returns a list
      instead of a dictionary. If a product is unavailable then its specific
      price is set to None.
v0.1.6, 2012-03-17
    * Changed signature of the store.products and store.retrieve_product
      methods. When dealing with unavailable products, the retrieve_product
      method now returns a Product object with None as price. The products
      method still returns a dictionary, but now its values are never None.
      If a product is unavailable then its specific price is set to None.
v0.1.5, 2012-03-14
    * Changed signature of the store.products method, it now returns a dict of
      url => product. This helps determine if a product was available or not
      by the caller (the value of the dict is None for those urls)
v0.1.4, 2012-03-05
    * Fixed bug that raised an error when trying to import all stores included
      in the package
v0.1.3, 2012-03-05

    * Added a couple of utility scripts to check the correct working of store scripts
