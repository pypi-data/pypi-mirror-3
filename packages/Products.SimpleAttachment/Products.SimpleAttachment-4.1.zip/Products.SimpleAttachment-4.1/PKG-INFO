Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        Several Plone products have a need to handle simple attachments: content
        types that do not have a workflow of their own but will reuse the
        permissions on their container. SimpleAttachment implements simple file
        and image attachment types that can serve this need.
        
        SimpleAttachment is released under the GNU General Public Licence, version 2.
        Please see http://gnu.org for more details.

        Changelog
        =========
        
        4.1 (2011-10-19)
        ----------------
        
        - Added a view to provide filename normalizations since PloneTool's 
          normalizeString does not do it any more.
          [ggozad, stefan]
        
        - Schema extend from p.a.blobs extension fields. Add an index_html to 
          FileAttachment to fix partial downloads.
          [ggozad, stefan]
        
        - include CMFCore permissions.zcml to make Plone 4.1 happy
          [jensens, 2011-10-06]
        
        - Add upgrade step to run blob_migration through generic setup.
          [saily]
        
        
        4.0 (2011-10-06)
        ----------------
        
        - Added ImageAttachment and FileAttachment blob content migrators and
          migration view (@@simple-attachment-migration)
          [petschki]
        
        - Removed transform cache from file attachment, but leave cache invalidation
          in place. Reducing the size of the Data.fs is important.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Removed the `SimpleAttachment` spelling of the GenericSetup profile. Use
          `profile-Products.SimpleAttachment:default` instead.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Removed the CachingFileField and relevant FileAttachments patches. We do not
          want to store annotations any longer.
          [ggozad]
        
        - Use blob fields for FileAttachment and ImageAttachment
          [ggozad]

        ----------------
        
        - Fixed images and attachments in widgetmanagers were displayed in random
          order because default catalog query (implemented in 3.4) does not sort on
          'getObjPositionInParent' by default.  [saily]
        
        3.6 (2010-07-29)
        ----------------
        
        - Fixed the setuphandler step dependency.
          [rossp]
        
        - removed tabindex for plone 4 compatibility because of
          http://dev.plone.org/plone/changeset/36610/Plone/trunk/Products/CMFPlone/utils.py
          [hpeteragitator]
        
        3.5 (2010-05-18)

        3.3 (2010-04-21)
        ----------------
        
        - have import step handle kupu and tiny mce and not rely
          on kupu being there since it's not the default in Plone 4
          [vangheem]
        
        
        3.2 (2010-04-21)
        ----------------
        
        - registerType needs PROJECTNAME as second parameter
          [toutpt]

        - Adding missing history file and resurrecting the past contributions.
          [andrewb]
        
        - Reconfigure test setup.  Ensure that our zcml configuration deferred until
          the setup of the Plone site testing layer.  Helps for use with roadrunner
          [andrewb]
        
        3.0.2 (2007-11-28)
        ------------------
