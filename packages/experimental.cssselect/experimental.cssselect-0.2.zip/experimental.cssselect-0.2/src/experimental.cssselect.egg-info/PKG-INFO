        ======================

        Changes
        =======
        
        0.2 2012-04-04
        --------------
        
        * Make ``:contains()`` case sensitive for simplicity and speed.
        
        * Update to lxml master to fix problems with spaces in selector groups.
        
        0.1 2011-03-23
        --------------
        
        * In lxml.cssselect, use the xpath 'A//B' (short for
          'A/descendant-or-self::node()/B') instead of 'A/descendant::B' for the css
          descendant selector ('A B'). This makes a few edge cases to be consistent
          with the selector behavior in WebKit and Firefox, and makes more css
          expressions valid location paths (for use in xsl:template match).
        
        * Fork from lxml 2.3
