        ~~~~~~~~
        
          * Switched over to p4a.subtyper use
            (Rocky Burt)
        
          * Added smart folder criteria option for the ``object_provides`` interface
            so it's possible to add a smart folder that queries all activated links.
            To use this simply add a new smart folder and add a "Interfaces provided"
            criteria option.  Then type in the full string name of the interface
            you want to check, which in this case would be:
            ``p4a.plonevideoembed.interfaces.IVideoLinkEnhanced``
            (Rocky Burt)
        
          * Whenever ATLink's (and anything that provides ``IAnyVideoLinkCapable``)
            are added/modified, they are scanned to see if they contain known video
            site info, and if so, automatically activated as a video link.
            (Rocky Burt)
