This package provides additional loghandlers for use with the Python
standardlib `logging` module.

Currently, only one additional logging handler is provided, which
manages log file rotation based on Cron-like settings. So you can tell
to rotate the logs at every day, week, month, or similar. Different to
the `logging.handlers.TimedRotatingFileHandler` you can expect the
rotation to happen at beginning of intervals.

For instance, if you start daily logging with
`logging.handlers.TimedRotatingFileHandler` at 11:12h, a rollover will
happen at 11:12h on the next day. With
`ulif.loghandlers.DatedRotatingFileHandler` the rollover will instead
happen at midnight, regardless of when you started the logging.

Furthermore you can let the number of backup files increase
indefinitely by passing *backupCount* = -1.

Please note, that this package is still in a very early state and
changes, also to the API, are likely to happen in near future.

Comments and patches are welcome. Please send these to uli at gnufix
dot de.
