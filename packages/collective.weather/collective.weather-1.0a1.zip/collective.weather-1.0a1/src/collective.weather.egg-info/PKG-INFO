        A Plone viewlet to display the weather at selected locations.

        Weather Service`_.
        
        Don't Panic
        -----------
        
        Go to Plone's control panel and open Weather Setup.
        
        Select the service you want to use and the list of location ids that are going
        to be available on the viewlet.
        
        The user will be able to select from one of those locations. This information
        will be stored inside a browser cookie.
        
        The current weather condition of the selected location will be displayed at
        the viewlet.

        Installation
        ------------
        
        To enable this product in a buildout-based installation:
        
        1. Edit your buildout.cfg and add ``collective.weather`` to the list of eggs
           to install::
        
            [buildout]
            ...
            eggs =
                collective.weather
        
        2. If you are using Plone 4.1, you may need to extend a Dexterity known good
           set (KGS) to make sure that you get the right versions of the packages that
           make up Dexterity::
        
            [buildout]
            ...
            extends =
                http://good-py.appspot.com/release/dexterity/1.2.1
        
        After updating the configuration you need to run ''bin/buildout'', which will
        take care of updating your system.
        
        Go to the 'Site Setup' page in a Plone site and click on the 'Add-ons' link.
        
        Check the box next to ''collective.weather'' and click the 'Activate' button.
        
        Note: You may have to empty your browser cache and save your resource
        registries in order to see the effects of the product installation.
