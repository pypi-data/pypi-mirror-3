Description: fastavro
        ========
        
        The current Python `avro` package is packed with features but dog slow.
        
        On a test case of about 10K records, it takes about 14sec to iterate over all of
        them. In comparison the JAVA `avro` SDK does it in about 1.9sec.
        
        `fastavro` is less feature complete than `avro`, however it's much faster. It
        iterates over the same 10K records in 2.9sec, and if you use it with PyPy it'll
        do it in 1.5sec (to be fair, the JAVA benchmark is doing some extra JSON
        encoding/decoding).
        
        If the options C extension (generated by `Cython`_) is available, then
        `fastavro` will be even faster. For the same 10K records it'll run in about
        1.7sec.

        Usage
        =====
        ::
        
            from fastavro import iter_avro
        
            with open('weather.avro', 'rb') as fo:
                avro = iter_avro(fo)
                schema = avro.schema
        
                for record in avro:
                    process_record(record)
        
        You can also use the `fastavro` module from the command line to dump `avro`
        files. Each record will be dumped to standard output in one line of JSON.
        ::
        
            python -m fastavro weather.avro
        
        You can also dump the avro schema::
        
            python -m fastavro --schema weather.avro
        
        Limitations
        ===========
        * Support only iteration
            - No writing for you!
        * Supports only `null` and `deflate` codecs
            - `avro` also supports `snappy`
        * No reader schema
