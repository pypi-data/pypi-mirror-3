This file contains some tests for modules in the stdnum package to
check whether all provided is_valid() functions can handle clearly
invalid junk.

>>> testvalues = ( None, '*&^%$', '', 0, False, object(),  )

>>> from stdnum import grid, iban, imei, imsi, isan, isbn, isil, ismn, issn, ean
>>> from stdnum import luhn, meid, verhoeff
>>> from stdnum.iso7064 import mod_11_10, mod_11_2, mod_37_2, mod_37_36, mod_97_10
>>> from stdnum.nl import bsn
>>> from stdnum.br import cpf
>>> from stdnum.us import ssn

Go over each imported module and try every value.

>>> for mod in locals().values():
...     if hasattr(mod, 'is_valid'):
...         results = [ x for x in testvalues if mod.is_valid(x) ]
...         if results:
...             print mod.__name__, results
