        Q: So, what's this about then?
        ==============================
        
        Thpppt lets you make a quick start to your shiny new project by saving you tiresome typing.
        
        Q: So, like, a scaffolding/boilerplate/skeleton thing then?
        ===========================================================
        
        Exactly that.
        
        Q: So this would be what, the 54th PyPi project to solve this "problem" then?
        =============================================================================
        
        Yeah, about that. Not even counting all the versions of this in other languages...
        
        Q: Oh right. Well, I'll let you know
        ====================================
        
        To be honest, Thpppt is more about writing a sample application for this other library [1] that I've
        written than it is about "Solving" this "Problem". You know, in order to DogFood the API.
