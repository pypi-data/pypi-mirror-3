django-daterange-filter 
=======================

Add the option to filter by a custom date range on the admin. This allows
to inputs to be used to get the custom date range filters.

See datefilter.png of a screenshot of how this is seen on the admin.

**IMPORTANT:** this will work with Django 1.4. I won't work with previous Django
versions.

Installation
------------

Use pip/easy_install

    pip install django-daterange-filter


Add daterange_filter to settings.INSTALLED_APPS. Then configure your admin::

    from daterange_filter.filter import DateRangeFilter

    ...

    list_filter = (
        ...
        ('created', DateRangeFilter),
        ...
    )


DateRangeFilter honours localization and supports local date formats for filtering.
