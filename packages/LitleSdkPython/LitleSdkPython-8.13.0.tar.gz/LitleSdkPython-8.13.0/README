```python
from litleSdkPython.litleOnlineRequest import *

config = Configuration()
config.setUser("User")
config.setPassword("Pass")
config.setMerchantId("123")
config.setUrl("Sandbox")
config.setProxy("")

#sale
sale = litleXmlFields.sale()
sale.orderId = '1'
sale.amount = 10010
sale.orderSource = 'ecommerce'
contact = litleXmlFields.contact();
contact.name="John Smith"
contact.addressLine1="1 Main St."
contact.city="Burlington"
contact.state="MA"
contact.zip="01803-3747"
contact.country="USA"
sale.billToAddress = contact
card = litleXmlFields.cardType()
card.number = "4457010000000009"
card.expDate = "0112"
card.cardValidationNum = "349"
card.type = 'VI'
sale.card = card

litleXml = litleOnlineRequest(config)
response = litleXml.sendRequest(sale)

#display results
print "Message: " + response.message
print "LitleTransaction ID: " + str(response.transactionResponse.litleTxnId)
```
NOTE: you may need to edit the proxy to to work for your system
