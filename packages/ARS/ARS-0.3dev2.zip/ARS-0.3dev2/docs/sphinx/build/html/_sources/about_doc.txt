About the documentation
==============================


When documenting ARS, some good practices are required. However, if you are not
familiar with the tools or guidelines used, please do contribute by sending
plain text and someone else will take care of including it in the proper way.

Style guide
--------------------

Although not yet enforced, the
`Python documentation style guide <http://docs.python.org/devguide/documenting.html>`_
is the reference for writing ARS's documentation.

Generation
--------------------

This documentation is generated automatically by Sphinx from
rst (reStructuredText) files and the docstrings in the code,
both of which are in the project's repository.

For more information about Sphinx, see http://sphinx.pocoo.org/

For more information about reStructuredText, see
http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html and http://sphinx.pocoo.org/rest.html
