Introduction
=============


A doormat is a couple of links which are presented in a structured way.
One example is the current plone.org, where the div#sitemap at the
bottom consists of some ordered bundles of internal and external links,
with sections called "Downloads", "Documentation", "Developers",
"Plone foundation" and "Support".

This product adds a control panel in which you can design your doormat
with a WYSIWYG editor. No contenttypes are added.
