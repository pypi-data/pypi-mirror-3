Django FAQ
==========

Overview
--------

This Django_ application provides the ability to create and manage lists of
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ), organized by topic.

This project is still under development, though several medium-to-large
websites are currently using it in production. The plan is to get a stable
version with a full test suite and documentation out the door in the coming
months.
