Description: A light, Bootstrap-inspired theme
        =================================
        
        LighterTheme skins Trac, slightly, for a "lighter" look-and-feel.  It provides a narrower (940px) main content div; fewer dark lines in the top (mainnav and metanav) banner; bigger buttons (using CSS from Twitter Bootstrap); rounded corners on input fields; and the "Ubuntu" font used on Launchpad.
        
        Screenshots are available on the plugin's Trac Hacks page: http://trac-hacks.org/wiki/LighterTheme
        
        Changes
        =======
        
        0.2.1 (24 Aug 2012)
        -------------------
        
        Added MANIFEST.in file; the distribution now includes the necessary CSS 
        assets as well as the code's LICENSE file.
        
        0.2 (20 Aug 2012)
        -----------------
        
        Fix compatibility with other plugins: previously, this plugin would
        cause other plugins' add_stylesheet() calls to break, because of some
        incompatibility with Genshi's cut()/buffer() commands.  This is now
        fixed by avoiding calls to cut() and buffer()
