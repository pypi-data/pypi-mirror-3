        Overview
        --------
        
        This product allows you to add a portlet to your site that will show the
        latest comments made to a Facebook wall.
        
        Prerequisites
        -------------
        
        This product depends on `collective.facebook.accounts`_.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        - Add a "Facebook wall Portlet" wherever you want
        - Enter a header (if you want one)
        - Choose the Facebook account to use from the drop-down (See prerequisites)
        - Enter the "wall ID" of the wall you want to be listed. For example, if you
          want the content from https://www.facebook.com/plonecms, just enter
          "plonecms" as the wall ID. For more info, check
          https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/api
        - Enter the maximum number of entries you want the portlet to show
        - And mark the checkbox if you want only the posts made from the wall owner to
          be shown (plonecms in this case), or leave it unmarked if you want all posts
          no matter who posted them.
        
        That's it.
