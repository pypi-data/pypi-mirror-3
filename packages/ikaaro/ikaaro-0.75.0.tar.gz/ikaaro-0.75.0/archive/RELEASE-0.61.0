ikaaro 0.61.0 (2010/03/02)
==========================

This is a Content Management System built on Python & itools, among
other features ikaaro provides:

 - content and document management (index&search, metadata, etc.)
 - multilingual user interfaces and content
 - high level modules: wiki, forum, tracker, etc.

This is the companion release of itools 0.61; most important changes in
this development cycle have gone to itools, and so this ikaaro release
is relatively small:

- The bundled jquery has been upgraded from 1.3.2 to 1.4.2

- Minor user interface improvements here and there

- Sensible speed-up, mostly due to the optimizations to the database
  layer in itools.handlers

For further details check the UPGRADE file.
