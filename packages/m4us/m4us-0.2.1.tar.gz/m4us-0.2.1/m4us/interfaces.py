#---  Concurrency interfaces

class IThreadedCoroutine(core.ICoroutine):

    """`Interface` that defines threaded `coroutines`.

    Threaded `coroutines` work just like regular `coroutines`, except they run
    in separate threads.  This `interface` provides an additional method for
    explicitly starting the thread when it is appropriate.

    The advantage of running a threaded `coroutine` is that it's methods should
    return immediately allowing the main thread to continue running without
    blocking.

    The consequence of this, however, is that a `message` received from the
    `coroutine` is not necessarily the immediate response to the `message` that
    was sent in.  That is, both sent and received `messages` are queued up in
    order and potentially processed at different rates.  This is also true for
    thrown exceptions.

class IBackplane(core.ICoroutine):

    """`Interface` that defines `backplane` `coroutines`.

    This is an analogue to Kamaelia_'s :class:`!Backplane`, and
    :class:`!SubscribeTo` components.

    A `backplane` is a `coroutine` to which one or more `publishers` can send
    `messages`, and to which one or more `subscribers` can then recieve those
    `messages`.  The advantage of using a `backplane` is that the `subscribers`
    do not need to know about the `publishers` and vice versa.  The only thing
    they each need to have is the `backplane` `coroutine` through which they
    are communicating.

    `Publishers` register themselves by sending an :class:`IRegisterPublisher`
    `message` to the `backplane`'s ``control`` `inbox`.  Similarily, they
    unregister themselves by sending an :class:`IUnregisterPublisher`
    `message`.  `Publishers` are expected to register before sending any
    `messages` and unregister before sending any
    :class:`~m4us.core.interfaces.IShutdown` `messages`.  All this is needed so
    that the backplane knows when the last `publisher` is done and can wait
    until then to shutdown.

    `Subscribers` to a `backplane`, just need `link` to the `backplane`'s
    ``outbox`` and ``signal`` `outboxes` like any other `producer` `coroutine`.

    A `backplane` will shutdown upon reciept of an
    :class:`~m4us.core.interfaces.IShutdown` `message` on it's ``control``
    `inbox`, but only when there are no registered `publishers` (i.e. they have
    all unregistered as part of their shutdown).  It will also forward the
    shutdown `message` on to all `subscribers` on it's ``signal`` `outbox`,
    but again, only when there are no registered `publishers`.

    :raises m4us.backplanes.NotRegisteredError: If a `publisher` attempts to
      unregister itself without already being registered.
    :raises m4us.backplanes.AlreadyRegisteredError: If a `publisher` attempts
      to register itself more than once.
