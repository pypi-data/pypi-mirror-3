ikaaro 0.62.6 (2011/02/17)
==========================

This is a Content Management System built on Python & itools, among
other features ikaaro provides:

 - content and document management (index&search, metadata, etc.)
 - multilingual user interfaces and content
 - high level modules: wiki, forum, tracker, etc.

Changes
-------

NOTE: when upgrading to this new version run icms-update-catalog.py, a
new index has been added to fix a usability problem, and so updating
the catalog is required.

The new configuration option 'auth-cookie-expires' allows to define the
expiration time (in minutes) for the authentication cookie. The default
is 0 (does not expire).

The commit log view has been improved, now it is possible to filter by
author email and by the commit message (bug #832).

The about page now shows the location (user, server and path) of the
ikaaro instance (bug #1105). But this information, and the software
that is installed, is now only visible to the site admins (bug #1104).

Now site administrators can mass subscribe many users to an observable
resource (like web page), even if the users are not in the database
(bug #1165). And non authenticated users can subscribe/unsubscribe
themselves to public resources.

The French translation has been updated.

Other issues resolved include:

  #994 When a user creates a web site make him admin
 #1150 Only admins can change the security policy
 #1164 cc: inherit the root admins when needed
 #1166 Fix renaming a resource if a parent folder has the same name
