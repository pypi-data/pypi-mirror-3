Description: 
        =======
        OERPLib
        =======
        
        `OERPLib` is a client library to OpenERP server. It aims to provide an easy way
        to remotely pilot an `OpenERP` server.
        In addition to supporting ``create``, ``read``, ``write``, ``unlink`` and
        ``search`` operations, this library is also able to generate objects which are
        somewhat similar to the browsable objects available on OpenERP server via the
        implementation of the ``browse`` method, and manipulate them while hiding
        XML-RPC queries.
        Retrieve reports and execute workflow queries are also possible.
        
        How does it work? See below::
        
            #!/usr/bin/env python
            import oerplib
        
            # Prepare the connection to the OpenERP server
            oerp = oerplib.OERP('localhost', 'db_name')
        
            # Login
            user = oerp.login('user', 'passwd')
            print(user.name)            # name of the user connected
            print(user.company_id.name) # the name of its company
        
            # Simple 'raw' query
            user_data = oerp.execute('res.users', 'read', user.id)
            print(user_data)
        
            # Or use the 'read' method
            # ('create', 'write', 'unlink' and 'search' exist too)
            user_data = oerp.read('res.users', user.id)
        
            # Advanced query: browse objects!
            for order in oerp.browse('sale.order', [1, 42]):
                print(order.name)
                for line in order.order_line:
                    print(line.name)
        
            # Update data through a browsable object
            order.name = "NEW ORDER REF"
            oerp.write(order)
        
        See the documentation for more details.
        
        Supported OpenERP versions
        --------------------------
        
        OERPLib is known to work with OpenERP server v5 and v6.
        
        Generate the documentation
        --------------------------
        
        To generate the documentation, you have to install Sphinx documentation
        generator::
        
            easy_install -U sphinx
        
        Now, you can use the ``build_sphinx`` option of the ``setup.py``::
        
            python setup.py build_sphinx
        
        The generated documentation will be in the ``./doc/html`` directory.
