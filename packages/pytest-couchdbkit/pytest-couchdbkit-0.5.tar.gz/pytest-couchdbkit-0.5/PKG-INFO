Description: pytest-couchdbkit
        =================
        
        pytest-couchdbkit is a simple pytest extension that manages test databases
        for your couchdbkit using apps.
        
        In order to use it, you only need to set the ini option
        `couchdbkit_suffix` to something fitting your app.
        Additionally you may use `couchdbkit_backend` to select
        the gevent/eventlet backends.
        
        
        To setup couchapps before running the tests,
        there is the `pytest_couchdbkit_push_app(server, dbname)` hook
        
        It can be used to create a pristine database,
        which is replicated into each test database.
        
        
        
        The provided funcarg `couchdb` will be a freshly flushed database
        named `pytest_` + couchdbkit_suffix,
        
        additionally, after each test item,
        the database will be dumped to tmpdir.join(couchdb.dump)
        
        which is a simple file having entries in the format::
        
            number(\d+) + "\r\n" + number bytes + "\r\n"
        
        entries are:
        
        * the db info
        * documents
        * raw attachment data following the document
        
        Attachments are ordered by name,
        so they can be reassigned to their metadata on loading.
        
        The dump format is meant to be human-readable.
        
        
        
        Future
        ------
        
        * fs fixtures (like couchapp)
        * code fixtures
        * dump fixtures
        * comaring a db to sets of defined fixtures

        - fix breaking testruns that dont actually use it
        - add a lot of tests i should have done before 0.4
        - add support for pytest-xdist,
          if a slave is detected, push_app wont be called,
          and dbname gets the gw id appended
        
        from 0.3 to 0.4

        - switch dump format to chunked encoding
        - pretty json in dumps
        - attachments in dumps
        - utility functions for loading dumps back to a database
        
        
        from 0.1 to 0.2
        ---------------
        
        - use json-lines as extension for the dump
        - condense json to one line per document for humanly acceptable parsinig
