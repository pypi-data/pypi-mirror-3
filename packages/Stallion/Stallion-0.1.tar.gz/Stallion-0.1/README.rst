Stallion is still under development and on its early stages.

Stallion
=========

Stallion is a Python Package Manager interface created to provide an "easy-to-use" visual interface
for Python newcomers. Today we have many nice distribution utilities like pip, distribute, etc, but
we don't have a nice visual approach with these same goals.

Easy to Install
