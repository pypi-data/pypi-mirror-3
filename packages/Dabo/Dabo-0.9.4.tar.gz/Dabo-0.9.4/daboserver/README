This is the main server portion of a Pylons installation that will serve
Dabo applications, making them true web apps.

The primary files of interest are:

controllers/bizservers.py: the main controller that handles web requests
	and works with the Dabo bizobjs as needed.

config/routing.py: routes the URLs of the requests to the appropriate
	controller methods.

controllers/OrdersBizobj.py: sample remote bizobj for the demo app.

appSource: the directory containing the source files for your
	application.


To use this, you will need Pylons installed. You would then create a new app using paste named 'daboserver'. This will create a directory named 'daboserver', which will contain a subdirectory also named 'daboserver'. Replace that subdirectory with the one included here, and start the webserver.
