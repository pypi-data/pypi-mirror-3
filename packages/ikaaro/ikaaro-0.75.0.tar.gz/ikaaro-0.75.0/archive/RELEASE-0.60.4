ikaaro 0.60.4 (2009/09/17)
==========================

This is a Content Management System built on Python & itools, among
other features ikaaro provides:

 - content and document management (index&search, metadata, etc.)
 - multilingual user interfaces and content
 - high level modules: wiki, forum, tracker, etc.

The performance of the icms-update-catalog.py script has been much
improved.  Now it is also possible to update the catalog while the
server is running in read-only mode (#728).

There have been other optimizations, including faster icms-init.py
and icms-update.py scripts, and faster image thumbnails.

Many bugs have been fixed and small improvements realized, including
#596, #630, #684, #699, #722, #731, #732, #739 and #743.
