Description: SignupSheet
        ===========
        
        SignupSheet is an add-on product that allows site managers to create **custom
        registration forms for events, workshops, fundraisers** and other events that
        require **online registration**.  Each SignupSheet defines the fields that are used
        for each *Registrant* object they contain, through the ATSchemaEditorNG product.
        The Registrant object is what the end user fills out and submits.  The workflow
        places each submitted Registrant in a private state once it is submitted so
        that it can be reviewed and approved.
        
        The SignupSheet has these additional features:
         
        - Registrant fields can be exported to CSV
        - A waiting list and event size can be set, end users are emailed a message
          stating whether they are pending approval or on the waiting list.  
        - The signup sheet view indicates whether the SignupSheet is 'full', 'open' or
          whether user will be put on a  waiting list. This is calculated using the
          event size and waiting list settings.
        - End user is directed to a customizable thank you page.
          
        The key motivation behind this product is to provides a way for site managers
        to setup registration forms that do more than email the fields to an address.
        Having the fields be configurable is essential, since many groups have specific
        requirements for the data they are collecting for their events.
        
        Authenticated user
        ------------------
        
        If you plan to give to authenticated users a way to subscribe to events,
        SignupSheet try to fill automatically some registration data from the user's
        data.
        
        Know that if you keep all default fields ("*First name*", "*Last name*" and
        "*E-mail*"), they are filled automatically taking the same fields from the
        user.
        
        As Plone commonly use a single "*Fullname*" info, while SignupSheet split it
        to first and last name, the procedure try to split your fullname in two.
        
        If your fullname policy is to keep last, then first name in that order, you
        can change the same order modifiying the ``first_last_name_order`` property
        in the product's ZMI properties sheet.

        Acknowlegements
        ===============
        
        - This product would not be possible without the Poi and RichDocument
          products by Martin Aspeli.  They provided useful example code, specifically
          around the workflow trigger pattern.  
        - In addition Upfront Contacts by Roche Compaan for the CSV export code.  
        - In addition thanks to Simon Pamies for assisting me with ATSchemaEditorNG, and
          Andreas Jung for providing useful code improvements.  
        - Naro for the Plone 3 compatibility work

        Known Issues and Potential Improvements
        =======================================
            
        - Signupsheet needs more explanatory text.  Schema editor has been simplified
          but needs better explanatory text.
        - It is possible to prematurely fill up registration by malicious user.
          Subscriptions are no more saved (and a portal status message is displayed),
          but confirmation e-mail are sent.
        - At release time, the last ATSchemaEditorNG available version was the `0.6.0`__.
          Using this version you will have some problems with signup sheet validation
          (see ticket `#26`__ for the fix)
        - If you are using this behind `Varnish`__ or other reverse-proxy, you can experience
          privacy problems. Please configure you environment to not cache URL with
          ``thank_you_message``, or enable the ``traverse_to_thankyou`` flag in the
          ``signupsheet_properties`` sheet.

        - added tests for email and posting workflow
        - bulk of Plone 3 compatibility work done by Radmin Novotny  
        
        
        0.2.0 Beta
        ----------
        Andreas Jung and Radim Novotny contributed significantly to this release.
        
        - added Portuguese Brasilian translation. Thanks Vitor Reis.
        - added 'view registrants' that displays current registrants status and allows for confirming and editing registrants
        - added i18n support for templates
        - added German translation
        - updated tests to pass
        - updated i18n
        - Because thank_you_page and email_response fields were changed from TextField
          to ZPTField it is necessary to manually run migration code from 
          Extensions/migrate method fixZPTFields. This method will read
          old values from these two fields and store the same value in new format.
          WARNING: if you don't run migration you will get AttributeError: read
          when accessing old SignupSheet objects  
        - It is possible to generate HTML emails
        - workflow script sendInitialEmail is called *before* the transition,
          because anonymous can access registrant object only in 'new' state.
          If script will be called after transition, Registrant.sendNotificationMail
          method won't have access to registrant object. Access is required due to 
          rendering templates from ZPTField.
        - removed signupsheet_email_* templates
        - Introduced TALESField and TemplateFields dependecy. SignupSheet uses
          these two fields for scripting thank_you_page, confirmation and 
          notification email (subject and message).
          Syntax is described in field help text::
        
             context = SignupSheet
             options/registrant = current Registrant object
             
        - added notifyEmail field to signupsheet schema. It allows to send notification 
          about new registrant to some email address.
        - removed registration of SignupSheet.css from portal_css
        - it is possible to use options/computed_text in email template now
        - use getSiteEncoding if available
        - additional i18n work (signupsheet.py - schema)
        - improved i18n catalogs, added Czech translation
        - do not depend on Kupu in install code
        - replaced dtml templates with ZPT with i18n
        - use base_view for SignupSheet and simplified signupsheet_view template
        
        
        0.1.1
        -----
        - fixed bug that caused editing existing Registrant objects to fail
        - added import for ATSENG so test run properly
        - fixed incorrect security declaration for registrantFieldNames
        
        0.1
        ---
        - Installs ATSENG dependency
        - Fixed bug for computing status, added tests against bug
        - Fixed manager can override initial post state

        - Fixed Thank you message renders proper HTML
        - Fixed email response so that it is text only
