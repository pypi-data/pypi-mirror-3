    """
    Initializes the edbob framework, typically by first reading some config
    file(s) to determine which interfaces to engage.  This must normally be
    called prior to doing anything really useful, as it is responsible for
    extending the live API in-place.

    The meaning of ``args`` is as follows:

    If ``args`` is empty, the ``EDBOB_CONFIG`` environment variable is first
    consulted.  If it is nonempty, then its value is split according to
    ``os.pathsep`` and the resulting sequence is passed to
    ``edbob.config.read()``.

    If both ``args`` and ``EDBOB_CONFIG`` are empty, the "standard" locations
    are assumed, and the results of calling both
    :func:`edbob.configuration.default_system_paths()` and
    :func:`edbob.configuration.default_user_paths()` are passed on to
    ``edbob.config.read()``.

    Any other values in ``args`` will be passed directly to
    ``edbob.config.read()`` and so will be interpreted there.  Basically they
    are assumed to be either strings, or sequences of strings, which represent
    paths to various config files, each being read in the order in which it
    appears within ``args``.  (Configuration is thereby cascaded such that the
    file read last will override those before it.)
