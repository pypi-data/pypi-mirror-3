metlog-psutils is a plugin extension for `Metlog 
<http://github.com/mozilla-services/metlog-py>`.  metlog-psutils
provides details about network connections, memory usage, cpu usage
and even some thread details.

This plugin works best on Linux.  Running the plugin under OSX will
skip some functionality and will require root privileges.

More information about how Mozilla Services is using Metlog (including what is
being used for a router and what endpoints are in use / planning to be used)
can be found on the relevant `spec page
<https://wiki.mozilla.org/Services/Sagrada/Metlog>`_.
