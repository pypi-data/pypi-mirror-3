    and supporting _m_changed marker concept.

    This item must get defined with a zope.schema.Object field and the 
    MongoGeoLocationProperty property. for more info see geo.txt and testing.py

    IMPORTANT:
    we use the order latitude, longitude and (NOT lon, lat) like described in
    mongodb documentation

    A more detailed description about the lon/lat order thema:

    looking at the Geographic Coordinate System, you'll notice that longitude
    counts left to right, while latitude counts bottom to top. Translating that
    into x/y this would mean the Longitude/Latitude approach is the only one
    that makes sense logically.

    In english, coordinates are usually referred to as latitude/longitude in a
    term. This is due to 2 reasons: a precedents o in the alphabet and in
    Navigation, in the days of sextants Latitude was easier, and more exactly
    determined, so that was the first thing to determine/write down.

    From OGC Specs, lon/lat is the correct way to interpret them. You can
    easily see that from how those that where participants in creating the
    Specs (Oracle/Informix/ESRI/IBM) implemented them, and those that did
    their own stuff (MS/Google).
