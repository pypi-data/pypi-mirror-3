        ====================
        
        This package provides a framework for mapping inbound e-mail onto
        application-defined handlers.
        
        Please see docs/index.rst for the documentation.

        =======================
        
        0.4 (2012-01-25)
        ----------------
        
        - Added an option to pass None to the the 'pop' method of the pending
          queue:  in this case, the queue returns *all* pending messsage IDs.
        
        - Moved to GitHub.
        
        - Ensure that the ``pollster`` script pushes message IDs onto the pending
          queue, if configured.
        
        - Added ``SaneFilenameMaildir``, which overrides the standard library's
          ``mailbox.Maildir`` to ensure that the generated filenames are strictly
          sortable in creation order.
        
        
        0.3.1 (2009-07-08)
        ------------------
        
        - N.B.:  the quarantine feature introduced in version 0.3 requires a
          backward-incompatible change to the database scehma.  Existing databases
          will not have the extra columns required to support the new feature.
          The simplest fix is as follows:
          
          * Stop any ongoing processing using the pending database.
          
          * Dump any existing message IDs from the database.
        
          * Move aside the database file.
        
          * Rerun the script which creates the database file.
        
          * Restore any dumped message IDs.
        
        
        0.3 (2009-07-08)
        ----------------
        
        - Added quarantine to pending queue.
        
        
        0.2 (2009-06-23)
        ----------------
        
        - 100% unit test coverage.
        
        - Hardened ``PendingQueue.pop`` against RFC-violating message IDs with
          non-decodable 8-bit characters.
        
        - Added logging of underflows in ``PendingQueue.pop``.
        
        - Made ``PendingQueue.pop`` a normal method, rather than a generator.
        
        - Added ``PendingQueue.logger`` attribute:  if set, should obey the
          interface of a ``logging`` module logger.
        
        
        0.1.5 (2009-05-31)
        ------------------
        
        - Skip incoming messages with duplicate message ids to messages we have
          already processed;  apparently some Microsoft clients resend messages
          without updating the Message-Id header, in violation of RFCs.
        
        
        0.1.4 (2009-05-04)
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed case where pop with multiple pending IDs and a given isolation level
          would cause the delete to fail with 'database locked'.  See:
          https://bugs.launchpad.net/karl3/+bug/364251
        
        - Fixed bug found by inspection where "underflow" on pop would leave the
          message IDs which *had* been returned on the queue.
        
        
        0.1.3 (2009-03-13)
        ------------------
        
        - Added ``PendingQueue.__del__`` to ensure closing the SQL connection.
        
        - ``MaildirStore.drainInbox``:  don't remove the message from the maildir
          until after adding to the store.
        
        
        0.1.2 (2009-01-22)
        ------------------
        
        - Made ``draino`` script explicitly commit sqlite transactions if not running
          in ``dry-run`` mode.
        
        - Added ``isolation_level`` argument to ``MaildirStore.__init__``, to allow
          control of how the queue commits transactions.  The default, ``None``,
          causes the connection to defer commits.
        
        
        0.1.1 (2009-01-16)
        ------------------
        
        - Added ``isolation_level`` argument to ``PendingQueue.__init__``, to allow
          control of how the queue commits transactions.  The default, ``None``,
          causes the connection to autocommit after each statement.
        
        
        0.1 (2009-01-15)
        ----------------
        
        - Initial release.
