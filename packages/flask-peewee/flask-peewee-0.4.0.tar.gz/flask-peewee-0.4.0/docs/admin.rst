Admin Interface
===============

Many web applications ship with an "admin area", where priveleged users can
view and modify content.  By introspecting your application's models, flask-peewee
can provide you with straightforward, easily-extensible forms for managing your
application content.

Here's a screen-shot of the admin dashboard:

Getting started
---------------

To get started with the admin, there are just a couple steps:

1. Instantiate an :py:class:`Auth` backend for your project -- this component is responsible for providing the security for the admin area

    .. code-block:: python
    
        from flask import Flask
        
        from flask_peewee.auth import Auth
        from flask_peewee.db import Database
        
        app = Flask(__name__)
        db = Database(app)
        
        # needed for authentication
        auth = Auth(app, db)
        

2. Instantiate an :py:class:`Admin` object

    .. code-block:: python
    
        # continued from above...
        from flask_peewee.admin import Admin
        
        admin = Admin(app, auth)
        
3. Register any :py:class:`ModelAdmin` or :py:class:`AdminPanel` objects you would like to expose via the admin

    .. code-block:: python
    
        # continuing... assuming "Blog" and "Entry" models
        admin.register(Blog) # register "Blog" with vanilla ModelAdmin
        admin.register(Entry, EntryAdmin) # register "Entry" with a custom ModelAdmin subclass
        
        # assume we have an "AdminPanel" called "NotePanel"
        admin.register_panel('Notes', NotePanel)

4. Call :py:meth:`Admin.setup()`, which registers the admin blueprint and configures the urls

    .. code-block:: python
    
        # after all models and panels are registered, configure the urls
        admin.setup()


.. note::

    For a complete example, check the :ref:`example` which ships with the project.


Customizing how models are displayed
------------------------------------

We'll use the "Message" model taken from the `example app <https://github.com/coleifer/flask-peewee/tree/master/example>`_,
which looks like this:

.. code-block:: python

    class Message(db.Model):
        user = ForeignKeyField(User)
        content = TextField()
        pub_date = DateTimeField(default=datetime.datetime.now)
        
        def __unicode__(self):
            return '%s: %s' % (self.user, self.content)

If we were to simply register this model with the admin, it would look something
like this:

.. code-block:: python

    admin = Admin(app, auth)
    admin.register(Message)
    
    admin.setup()

.. image:: fp-message-admin.jpg

A quick way to improve the appearance of this view is to specify which columns
to display.  To start customizing how the ``Message`` model is displayed in the
admin, we'll subclass :py:class:`ModelAdmin`.

.. code-block:: python

    from flask_peewee.admin import ModelAdmin
    
    class MessageAdmin(ModelAdmin):
        columns = ('user', 'content', 'pub_date',)
    
    admin.register(Message, MessageAdmin)
    
    admin.setup()

Now the admin shows all the columns and they can be clicked to sort the data:

.. image:: fp-message-admin-2.jpg

Suppose privacy is a big concern, and under no circumstances should a user be
able to see another user's messages -- even in the admin.  This can be done by overriding
the :py:meth:`~ModelAdmin.get_query` method:

.. code-block:: python

    def get_query(self):
        return self.model.filter(user=g.user)

Now a user will only be able to see and edit their own messages.

Creating admin panels
---------------------

:py:class:`AdminPanel` classes provide a way of extending the admin dashboard with arbitrary functionality.
These are displayed as "panels" on the admin dashboard with a customizable
template.  They may additionally, however, define any views and urls.  These
views will automatically be protected by the same authentication used throughout
the admin area.

Some example use-cases for AdminPanels might be:

* Display some at-a-glance functionality in the dashboard, like stats on new
  user signups.
* Provide a set of views that should only be visible to site administrators,
  for example a mailing-list app.
* Control global site settings, turn on and off features, etc.

Referring to the `example app <https://github.com/coleifer/flask-peewee/tree/master/example>`_,
we'll look at a simple panel that allows administrators to leave "notes" in the admin area:

.. image:: fp-note-panel.jpg

.. image:: fp-note-panel-2.jpg

Here's what the panel class looks like:

.. code-block:: python

    class NotePanel(AdminPanel):
        template_name = 'admin/notes.html'
        
        def get_urls(self):
            return (
                ('/create/', self.create),
            )
        
        def create(self):
            if request.method == 'POST':
                if request.form.get('message'):
                    Note.create(
                        user=auth.get_logged_in_user(),
                        message=request.form['message'],
                    )
            next = request.form.get('next') or self.dashboard_url()
            return redirect(next)
        
        def get_context(self):
            return {
                'note_list': Note.select().order_by(('created_date', 'desc')).paginate(1, 3)
            }

When the admin dashboard is rendered (``/admin/``), all panels are rendered using
the templates the specify.  The template is rendered with the context provided
by the panel's ``get_context`` method.

And the template:

.. code-block:: python

    {% extends "admin/panels/default.html" %}

    {% block panel_content %}
      {% for note in note_list %}
        <p>{{ note.user.username }}: {{ note.message }}</p>
      {% endfor %}
      <form method="post" action="{{ url_for(panel.get_url_name('create')) }}">
        <input type="hidden" value="{{ request.url }}" />
        <p><textarea name="message"></textarea></p>
        <p><button type="submit" class="btn small">Save</button></p>
      </form>
    {% endblock %}

A panel can provide as many urls and views as you like.  These views will all be
protected by the same authentication as other parts of the admin area.
