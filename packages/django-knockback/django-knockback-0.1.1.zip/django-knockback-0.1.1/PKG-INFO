        ================
        
        Django-Knockback is a utility app that just contains all the javascript dependencies that are required in order to use `knockback.js <https://github.com/kmalakoff/knockback>`_.
        
        The app depends on `django-compressor <https://github.com/jezdez/django_compressor>`_ in order to serve knockback.js in both compressed and uncompressed forms.
        
        The current versions of the javascript libraries are:
        
        - Underscore 1.3.3
        - Backbone 0.9.2
        - Knockout 2.1.0
        - Knockback 0.15.4
        
        
        Installation:
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        Open the console and then type::
        
            pip install django-knockback
        
        Usage:
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        Include the 'knockback' app in the ``INSTALLED_APPS`` and then type::
        
            ./manage.py collectstatic.
        
        To include knockback.js into your page just include the knockback/knockback.html template into the <head> tag or extend the knockback/base.html template.
        The base.js has two blocks named head and body that contain the content of their respective tags.
