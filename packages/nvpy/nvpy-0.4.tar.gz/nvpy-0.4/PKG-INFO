Description: ====
        nvPY
        ====
        
        nvpy is a simplenote-syncing note-taking tool inspired by nvALT (OS X)
        and ResophNotes (Windows). It is significantly uglier, but it is
        cross-platform.  Yes, you heard right, you can run this on Linux
        (tested), Windows (tested) and OS X (in theory).
        
        It was written by Charl Botha, who needed a simplenote client on
        Linux and doesn't mind ugliness (that much). nvpy lives happily at
        https://github.com/cpbotha/nvpy
        
        DISCLAIMER
        ==========
        If nvpy blows up your computer, loses your job or just deletes all
        your notes, I am NOT liable for anything. Also see the liability
        clause at the end of the new BSD licence text in the COPYRIGHT file.
        
        That being said, I use nvpy daily on my own precious notes database
        and it hasn't disappointed me (yet).
        
        Screenshots and screencasts
        ===========================

        Installation
        ============
        
        To install the latest development version from github, do::
        
            pip install git+https://github.com/cpbotha/nvpy.git#egg=nvpy
        
        OR, to install the version currently on pypi, do::
        
            pip install nvpy
        
        OR, you can of course use easy\_install instead::
        
            easy_install nvpy
        
        github always has the latest development version, whereas I upload
        tagged snapshots (v0.3 for example) to pypi.
        
        How to run for the first time
        =============================
        
        Create a file called .nvpy.cfg in your home directory that looks like
        the following::
        
            [default]
            sn_username = your_simplenote_username
            sn_password = your_simplenote_password
        
        If you installed this via pip install, you should now be able to start
        the application by typing "nvpy". The first time you run it, it will take
        a while as it downloads all of your simplenote notes. Subsequest runs
        are much faster as it uses the database it stores in your home directory.
        
        The `example nvpy.cfg <https://github.com/cpbotha/nvpy/blob/master/nvpy/nvpy-example.cfg>`_ shows how you can configure the font 
        family and size.
        
        Keyboard handling
        =================
        
        nvPY was designed for lightning-speed note-taking and management with the keyboard. Here's a summary of the different shortcut keys:
        
        ========== ==========
        Key combo  Action
        ========== ==========
        Ctrl-D     Move note to trash. This can be easily recovered using the simplenote webapp.
        Ctrl-F     Start real-time incremental regular expression search. As you type, notes list is filtered. Up / down cursor keys go to previous / next note.
        Ctrl-M     Render Markdown note to HTML and open browser window.
        Ctrl-N     Create new note.
        Ctrl-Q     Exit nvPY.
        Ctrl-R     Render reStructuredText (reST) note to HTML and open browser window.
        Ctrl-S     Force sync of current note with simplenote server. Saving to disc and syncing to server also happen continuously in the background.
        ESC        Go from edit mode to notes list.
        ENTER      Start editing currently selected note. If there's a search string but no notes in the list, ENTER creates a new note with that search string as its title.
        ========== ==========
        
        Features
        ========
        
        * Syncs with simplenote.
        * Partial syncs (whilst notes are being edited) are done by a
          background thread so you can keep on working at light speed.
        * Can be used offline, also without simplenote account.
        * Search box does realtime regular expression searching in all your
          notes.
        * Markdown rendering to browser.
        * Continuous rendering mode: If you activate this before
          starting the markdown rendering, nvpy will render new html of
          the currently open note every few seconds. Due to the refresh
          tag in the generated HTML, the browser will refresh every few
          seconds. MAGIC UPDATES!
        * reStructuredText (reST) rendering to browser. Yes, you can use nvPY
          as your reST previewer.
        * Automatic hyperlink highlighting in text widget.
        * KickAss(tm) inter-note linking with [[note name]]. If note name is
          not found in current list of notes, assumes it's a regular expression
          and sets it in the search bar. See the `screencast <http://youtu.be/NXuVMZr31SI>`_.
        
        Planned features
        ================
        
        * Undo / redo.
        * Full(ish) screen mode.
        * Full syncs also in background thread. At the moment does a full sync
          at startup, which can take a while. nvpy already does background thread
          saving and syncing while you work, so everything you type is backed up
          within a few seconds of you typing it.
        * Tag support.
        
        Bugs and feedback
        =================
        
        * Report bugs with `the github issue tracker <https://github.com/cpbotha/nvpy/issues>`_.
        * It's an even better idea to clone, fix and then send me a pull request.
        * If you have questions, or would like to discuss nvpy-related matters, please do so via the `nvpy google discussion group / mailing list <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/nvpy>`_.
        * If you really like nvpy, you could make me and you even happier by `tipping me with paypal <https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=BXXTJ9E97DG52>`_!
