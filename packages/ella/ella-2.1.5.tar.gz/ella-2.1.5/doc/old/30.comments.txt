================================
Ella universal commenting system
================================

This application is inspired by django.contrib.comments
but the major difference between them is that ella.comments
is using newforms from django trunk.

There is used only one model in ella.comments instead of two
for free and authorized in django.contrib.comments.

Every comment has got Foreign key to its parent, this gives it
the ability to traverse comments and print them as threads.

Set up is pretty easy as is installing any other django application::

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        [...]
        'ella.comments',
        [...]
    )

After then you have got full access to usefull templatetags::

    {% load comments %}

    {% get_comment_form for object as comment_form %}
    {% get_comment_list for testapp.apple with id 1 as comment_list orderby -submit_date %}
    {% get_comment_count for object as comment_count %}

Also you can use special inclusion tag::

    {% get_comment_list for object as comment_list %}
    {% for comment in comment_list %}
    {% print_comment comment %}

With this inclusion tag you can create nested (threded) comments' list.


Template tag {% get_comment_form %}
-----------------------------------
Note that when notation like {% get_comment_form for object with 'LO' as comment_form %} is used
available options are:
'LO' ... stands for only logged in users form.
'UN' ... stands for only unknown users form.
