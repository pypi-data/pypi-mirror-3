Description
-----------

The easypg package provides modules to make using Pygame_ easier,
particularly for those learning to program.

Currently, it consists of a module defining some standard colour tuples,
a module to simplify the drawing of lines, shapes and text, a module
to support font handling, two modules to support the use of sprites and a
general utilities module providing various tools such as a ``Window``
class with a built-in display loop.

See the module docstrings for more information.
