        Do you hate this screen? Do you hate switching screens to see issues? Do you love the terminal? Then you will love this project.
        
        During the development of this plugin Github smartened up and introduced a new way to create repositories. Hopefully people who like to stay in the terminal will enjoy this litle cli app.
