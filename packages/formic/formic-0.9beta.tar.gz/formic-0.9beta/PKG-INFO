Description: Formic: Apache Ant Globs in Python
        ==================================
        
        Formic is an implementation of Apache Ant Globs in Python. The package can be
        used either from the command line or as a library.
        
        Quickstart
        ----------
        
        Formic can be installed from the Cheeseshop with easy_install or pip.:
        
           $ easy_install formic
        
        Once installed, you can use Formic either from the command line:
        
           $ formic -i "*.py" -e "__init__.py" "**/*test*/" "test_*"
        
        Or integrated right into your Python 2.7 project::
        
            import formic
            fileset = formic.FileSet(include="**.py",
                                     exclude=["**/*test*/**", "test_*"]
                                     )
        
            for file_name in fileset.qualified_files():
                # Do something with file_name
                ...
        
        That's about it :)
