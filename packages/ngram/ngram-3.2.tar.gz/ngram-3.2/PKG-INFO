Description: approximate string matching based on N-Grams.
        
        Here is the documentation_ annd the tutorial_.
        
        How does it work?
        =================
        
        The NGram class extents the Python set class with the ability 
        to search for set members ranked by their N-Gram string similarity 
        to the query. There are also methods for comparing a pair of strings.
        
        The set stores arbitrary items by using a specified "key" function 
        to produce the string representation of set members for the n-gram indexing.
        
        N-grams are obtained by splitting strings into overlapping substrings
        of N (usually N=3) characters in length.o
        
        To find items similar to a query string, it splits the query into N-grams,
        collects all items sharing at least one N-gram with the query,
        and ranks the items by score based on the ratio of shared to unshared
        N-grams between strings.

        The starting point was the Perl String::Trigram_ module by Tarek Ahmed.
        In 2007, Michel Albert (exhuma) wrote the ngram module and submitted 2.0.0b2 to
        Sourceforge. Since late 2008 python-ngram has been developed by Graham Poulter,
        adding features, documentation, performance improvements and Python 3 support.
