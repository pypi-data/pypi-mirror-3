Products.highlighter Installation
---------------------------------

If you are using zc.buildout and the plone.recipe.zope2instance
recipe to manage your project, you can do this:

* Add ``Products.highlighter`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.:

    [buildout]
    ...
    eggs =
        ...
        Products.highlighter
       
* Tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug:

    [instance]
    recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
    ...
    zcml =
        Products.highlighter
      
* Re-run buildout, e.g. with:

    $ ./bin/buildout
        
You can skip the ZCML slug if you are going to explicitly include the package
from another package's configure.zcml file.


Because its top level Python namespace package is called ``Products``, this
package can also be installed in Zope 2 as an old style **Zope 2 Product**.

For that, move (or symlink) the ``highlighter`` folder of this project
(``Products.highlighter/Products/highlighter``) into the ``Products`` directory of
the Zope instance it has to be installed for, and restart the server.

You can also skip the ZCML slug if you install this package the **Zope 2
Product** way.

Once you have included Products.highlighter in your buildout, and have
restarted your Plone site, you can then install it via the quick installer
from the Plone Control Panel.

Go to the "Site Setup" link in the top right corner. Click on Add-on Products.
Find the Products.highlighter and click on the checkbox. Then click on the install
button. 

As always if you are installing this in a live plone site already in
production, caution should be exercised, and always retain a full backup of
your site before going through the install process.
