"fablib" is a small collection of helper functions for the `Fabric`_ 
deployment and system administration tool.

Further, it is built on top of the `cuisine`_ library of Fabric helper functions.

Warning: This is *alpha* software.  Anything and everything could change without notice.   Also, I should probably try get some of these into a state where
they can be added to `cuisine`_.

Installation
============

Install from `PyPI`_ using `pip installer`_:

    pip install fablib

.. _Fabric: http://fabfile.org
.. _cuisine: http://github.com/sebastien/cuisine
