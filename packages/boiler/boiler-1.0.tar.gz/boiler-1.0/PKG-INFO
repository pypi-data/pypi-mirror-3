        	$ boiler -l 
        
        	Present plates

            $ boiler initscript nameyouwant_forscript
        
        The basic idea is to have a central way to recall common script template or frequently used folder layout and the likes.    
        It is all based on tpl files / folder called **plates** which are the template to create.
        
        - `boiler -l` will list all available plates to fire
        - `boiler <plate_name> help` will give help on that plate
        - `boiler <plate_name> [new_name]` will create the boilerplate in current directory with new_name name
