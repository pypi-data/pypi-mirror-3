mpdlcd
======

MPDLcd is a small adapter which will display the status of a MPD server on a LCD screen, through lcdproc.

It currently supports a single layout, but should soon allow for more complex setups.


Running
-------

The command line is quite simple::

    # Connect to the local mpd and lcdproc, logging to stderr
    mpdlcdd


Other options are possible::

    mpdlcdd --mpd=mpd.example.org:1234 --lcdproc=lcd.example.org:456 \
            --syslog --syslog-facility=user2 --logleve=debug --lcd_debug
