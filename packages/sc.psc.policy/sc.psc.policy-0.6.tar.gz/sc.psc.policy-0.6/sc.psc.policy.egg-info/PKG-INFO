        Overview
        --------
        
        This package installs a Plone Software Center in a clean Plone Site.
        
        The main idea is to provide an easy and fast way to create a package repository, 
        like PyPi or plone.org/downloads, to be used by a company to release its 
        packages.
        
        .. warning:: This is an early alpha intended to be used internally only.
