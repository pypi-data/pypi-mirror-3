Description: Bessel functions of the first kind, denoted as Ja(x), are solutions of Bessel's differential
        equation that are finite at the origin (x = 0) for integer a, and diverge as x approaches zero
        for negative non-integer a. The solution type (e.g.,integer or non-integer) and normalization of
        Ja(x) are defined by its properties below. It is possible to define the function by its Taylor
        series expansion around x = 0.
        
        Bessel functions for python are only supported by SciPy package.
        Windows users: please download and install Scipy package.
