        Eventually this will be a python module to access the GitHub v3 API.
        
        This is not stable yet and there is no backwards compatibility yet. There will 
        likely be some changes which change behavior in the near future.
        
        Easy Cloning
        ------------
        
        Assuming you have git 1.7.x (although I'm not entirely certain what version
        it was introduced in) you can perform ``git clone --recursive
        git://github.com/sigmavirus24/github3.py.git github3.py`` to clone this 
        and the submodule at the same time. Otherwise you have to do:
        
        ::
        
            $ git clone git://github.com/sigmavirus24/github3.py.git
            $ cd github3.py
            $ git submodule init
            $ git submodule update
