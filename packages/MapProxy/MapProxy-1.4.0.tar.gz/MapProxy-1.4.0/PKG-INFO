        MapProxy is a tile cache, but also offers many new and innovative features like full support for WMS clients.
        
        MapProxy is actively developed and supported by `Omniscale <http://omniscale.com>`_, it is released under the Apache Software License 2.0, runs on Unix/Linux and Windows and is easy to install and to configure.

        Changes
        -------
        1.4.0 2012-05-15
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Fixes:
        - fix TypeError exception when auth callback returns {authorized:'full'}
        - use MAPPROXY_LIB_PATH on platforms other that win32 and darwin
        - raise config error for mapnik sources when mapnik could not be imported
        
        1.4.0rc1 2012-05-02
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Features:
        
        - support clipping of requests to polygon geometries in security API 
        - support for WMS 1.3.0 extended layer capabilities
        - on_error handling for tile sources. fallback to empty/transparent
          tiles when the source returns HTTP codes like 404 or 204
        - add HTTP Cache-Control header to WMS-C responses
        
        Improvements:
        
        - WMS source requests and requests to cached tiles are now clipped
          to the extent. this should prevent projection errors when requesting
          large bbox (e.g. over 180/90 in EPSG:4326)
        - improved lock timeouts in mapproxy-seed
        - the debug source does not overwrite the layer extent anymore.
          makes it more usable in demo/wms clients
        - support for multiple files and recursion in base option
        - mapproxy-seed ETA output is now more responsive to changes in seed speed
        - improved demo service
          - choose different SRS for WMS layers
          - support for WMTS
        
        Fixes:
        
        - support loading of WKT polygon files with UTF8 encoding and BOM header
        - upgraded dictspec module with fix for some nested configuration specs.
          a bug prevented checking of the layers configuration
        
        Other:
        
        - the documentation now contains a tutorial
        - old layer configuration syntax is now deprecated
        - EPSG:4326/900913/3857 are now always initialized with the +over proj4
          option to prevent distortions at the dateline

        - new ``mapproxy-util serve-multiapp-develop`` command
        - new wms.bbox_srs option for bounding boxes in multiple SRS in WMS

        - fix BBOX in WMS-C capabilities
        - prevent exception for WMS requests with unsupported image formats with
          mime-type options (like 'image/png; mode=24bit')
        - fixed blank image results for servers that call .close() on the
          response (like gunicorn)
        
        Other:
        
        - origin option for tile sources is deprecated. use a custom grid with
