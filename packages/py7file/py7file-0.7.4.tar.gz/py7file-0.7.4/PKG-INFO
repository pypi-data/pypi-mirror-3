Description: ==========================================
        Py7File - Simple file handling with python
        ==========================================
        
        *Py7File wraps and unifies the python stdlib file handling modules with a simple
        and intuitive high-level api.*
        
        - **Think:** os.path, shutil etc. via object based method access.

        Installation
        ------------
        
        Use easy_install or pip::
        
            pip install py7file
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        Here some hopefully self explaining examples of Py7File usage::
        
            from py7file import Py7File
        
            the_file = Py7File('a_file.txt')
        
            # Copy and Move
            copied_file = the_file.copy('d_file.txt')  # copied_file is also a Py7file
            the_file.move('moved_file.txt')  # moves the file and mutates the reference
        
            # Backup and Restore
            the_file.backup()  # creates a_file_backup_001.txt
            the_file.backup()  # creates a_file_backup_002.txt
            the_file.delete()  # removes a_file.txt from disk (ups...)
            the_file.restore() # recovers file from a_file_backup_002.txt
        
            # Unzip and Rezip
            zfile = Py7File('a_file.zip')
            zfile.unzip() # creates a folder a_file_unzipped with contents of zipfile
            zfile.rezip() # repackages subfolder a_file_unzipped to a_file.zip
            
        See test_py7file.py for more examples.
        
        Testing
        -------
        Py7File is tested against python 2.6 and 2.7
        
        To run the tests::
        
            python test_py7file.py
        
        Status
        ------
        Well I am using this this file handling library quite extensivly myself and
        i got no complaints so far ;). Still please consider this Beta and
        use at your own risk...
        
        Background
        ----------
        As I started learning programming with python I found the different modules for
        handling files very confusing and cumbersome to use. While writing my first
        scripts I found myself writing os.path.join(...) way to often. I still
        keep mixing up os and shutil based file operations like copy, move, rename.
        So I started this little module to make things easier...
