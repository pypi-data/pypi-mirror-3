A partial implementation of the psycopg2 module using ctypes.

To use this package with Django or SQLAlchemy create a psycopg2.py file
somewhere in your python path (e.g. the current working dir) and add::

    from psycopg2ct import compat
    compat.register()

This will map psycopg2ct to psycopg2. 

Note: this module currently does not implement the full psycopg2 API. Only
the parts of the API which are used by Django / SQLAlchemy are implemented.

This module is only tested with python 2.7 (cpython and pypy).

This is a port of Alex Gaynor's rpython port (https://bitbucket.org/alex_gaynor/pypy-postgresql/overview) of psycopg2 to python + ctypes.
