Description: 
        hgapi is a pure-Python API to Mercurial, that uses the command-line
        interface instead of the internal Mercurial API. The rationale for
        this is twofold: the internal API is unstable, and it is GPL.
        
        hgapi works for Mercurial < 1.9, and will instantly reflect any
        changes to the repository, unlike interfaces based on the
        CommandServer (http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/CommandServer). It
        also has a really permissive license (do whatever you want, don't
        blame me).
        
        For example of code that uses this API, take a look at
        https://bitbucket.org/haard/autohook which now uses hgapi
        exclusively.
