Description: Rough list of features
        ======================
        
        Plone implementation of a mega drop-down menu based on 
        http://www.sohtanaka.com/web-design/mega-drop-downs-w-css-jquery/.
        
        Developed for Plone 3 and Plone 4.
        
        Uses 
        `collective.collage.nested <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/collective.collage.nested>`_ 
        to support nested `Collage
        <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Products.Collage>`_ objects.
        
        Adds some actions in portal_actions/object_buttons:
        
        1. **Enable Megamenu**: adds ``IMegamenuEnabled`` interface to current folder.
        #. **Current Megamenu**: selects current folder as current megamenu (the one
           that will be displayed in ``plone.portalheader`` viewlet manager).
        #. **Disable Megamenu**: removes ``IMegamenuEnabled`` interface to current folder.
        #. **Test Megamenu**: shows a preview of the current megamenu-enabled folder as if 
           it were *the* megamenu. 
        
        Collage layout-views for ``ATCTContent``: ``menu`` and ``intro``.
        
        Collage renderer-views for Collage, Rows and Columns used inside the above
        layout-views. This is to provide cleaner HTML.
        
        JavaScript and CSS resources to support megamenu. Special CSS for Plone classic 
        theme (Plone 3 theme).
        
        Native support for ATFolders (see ``atfolder.zcml``) and plone.app.folder 
        (``ploneappfolder.zcm``) and can be extended for other custom folder implementations.
        
        How-to create a megamenu
        ========================
        
        1. Create a regular folder
        #. Go to Actions | Enable Megamenu
        #. Go to Actions | Current Megamenu to select the folder as the megamenu
           folder you want to display.
        #. Create as many Link objects to internal or external URLs you want to
           include in megamenu as regular links (no drop-down). Description is
           rendered as ``title`` attribute.
        #. Create as many Collage objects as items you want to show in your menu.
           Description is rendered as ``title`` attribute.
        #. Add one related item in your Colage objects to provide a default link
           (for non-JavaScript enabled browsers).
        #. Create as many rows and columns as you need in Collage and select the
           ``menu`` option in layout dropdown.
        #. ``menu`` rows have several skins to display horizontal or vertical 
           separating lines between rows and columns.
        #. Create as many objects as you need in the columns and select the ``menu`` 
           option in layout dropdown. 
        #. ``menu`` items have three skins to display just the title (no link), 
           regular link or highlighted (strong) link.
        #. Alternatively, you can select ``intro`` layout to provide more details:
           title, image and description.
        
        
        Megamenu controlpanel
        =====================
        
        You can:
        
        1. Enable / disable megamenu.
        #. Select current megamenu folder (from all the folders providing 
           ``IMegamenuEnable`` interface).
        #. Choose whether you want to include drop-down HTML markup in the page or
           load it via AJAX.
        #. Automatically hide all folder contents (and folder itself) when 
           megamenu-enabling (by setting expiration date).
        #. Automatically show all folder contents (and folder itself) when 
           megamenu-disabling (by removing expiration date).

        Installation
        ============
        
        * Add ``collective.collage.megamenu`` to the list of eggs to install and
          extend to a known good set for ``plone.app.registry``::
        
            [buildout]
            ...
            extends = 
                ...
                http://good-py.appspot.com/release/plone.app.registry/1.0b2
            ...
            eggs =
                ...
                collective.collage.megamenu
        
        * Tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug::
        
            [instance]
            recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
            ...
            zcml =
                collective.collage.megamenu
        
        * Re-run buildout, e.g. with::
        
            $ ./bin/buildout
        
        You can skip the ZCML slug if you are using Plone 3.3 or if you are going to explicitly include
        the package from another package's configure.zcml file.
