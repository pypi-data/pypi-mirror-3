It handles automatic updates to a lot of things, as well as making it easier to setup your custom changes on multiple machines.\r\n\r\nBasically, it performs a regular upgrade (via the stock script), then looks to see if the user's git repository has a remote named \"custom-overlay\". If it does, it pulls down that remote's \"custom-overlay\" branch. For an example of how that can be used, check out my other repository, over here.\r\n\r\nOnce those files are pulled down, it checks each subdirectory in the plugins folder for a .git folder inside that. That indicates that the plugin in that folder is distributed outside the main oh-my-zsh repository, and it therefore pulls down the latest changes from that repository as well.\r\n\r\nSome of the code may not be perfect. The system sometimes complains if you pull down a custom-overlay and have untracked versions of the files lying around - in that case, it prompts you to delete them before it pulls the new ones down. You can always cancel and do it manually if you want to see the differences :)\r\n\r\nHopefully this fits into your vision for this awesome piece of software.
