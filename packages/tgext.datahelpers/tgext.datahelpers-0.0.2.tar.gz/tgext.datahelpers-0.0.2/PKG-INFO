Description: About Data Helpers
        -------------------------
        
        tgext.datahelpers is a collection of utilities to help manage stored data
        in common web applications.
        
        tgext.datahelpers contains:
        
        - Validators to fetch objects from database by Id (both SQLA and Ming)
        - Store Attachments by just declaring a Column in your model
        - Store image and thumbnails by just declaring a Column in your model
        
        Installing
        -------------------------------
        
        tgext.datahelpers can be installed both from pypi or from bitbucket::
        
            easy_install tgext.datahelpers
        
        should just work for most of the users
        
        Validators
        --------------------------------
        
        ``tgext.datahelpers.validators`` provides the ``SQLAEntityConverter`` and
        ``MingEntityConverter`` that convert the given
        parameter (which is expected to be the primary key of an object) to
        the actually object itself::
        
            from tgext.datahelpers.validators import SQLAEntityConverter
        
            @expose()
            @validate({'doc':SQLAEntityConverter(Document)}, error_handler=index)
            def photo(self, doc):
                return redirect(doc.photo.url)
        
        Attachments
        -----------------------------------
        
        ``tgext.datahelpers.fields`` provides the ``Attachment`` field for SQLAlchemy
        to provide an easy and convenient way to store attachments.
        
        The ``Attachment`` field will permit to assign files to the attribute
        declared with ``Attachment`` type and will store a copy of the file on disk
        as soon as the object is committed to the database.
        
        The document field will provide a bunch of attributes you can use to
        access the file:
        
        - ``file`` - A file object pointing to the saved file
        - ``filename`` - The name of the saved file
        - ``url`` - Url from which the file is fetchable
        - ``local_path`` - Local path of the file on disk
        
        Files will be saved in ``tg.config['attachments_path']`` and url will be
        generated using ``tg.config['attachments_url']``. By default those are set
        at */public/attachments* and */attachments*.
        
        The ``Attachment`` field accepts a *attachment_type* parameter which specifies
        the kind of attachment that it is going to be saved. The default is
        ``tgext.datahelpers.fields.AttachedFile`` which just stores the file itself::
        
            from tgext.datahelpers.fields import Attachment
            class Document(DeclarativeBase):
                __tablename__ = 'document'
        
                uid = Column(Integer, autoincrement=True, primary_key=True)
                file = Column(Attachment)
        
            d = Document(file=open('/myfile.txt'))
            DBSession.add(d)
            DBSession.flush()
            DBSession.commit()
        
            d = DBSession.query(Document).first()
            print d.file.url
        
            '/attachments/747722ca-1a07-11e1-83fc-001ff3d72e6b/myfile.txt'
        
        Apart from file objects also instances of ``cgi.FieldStorage`` can be assigned
        to permit to quickly store uploaded files.
        
        Image Attachments with Thumbnail
        --------------------------------------
        
        Using the ``tgext.datahelpers.fields.AttachedImage`` as the argument of the
        ``Attachment`` field it is possible to quickly store images with their thumbnail.
        
        The resulting object will provide the same attributes as the generic Attachment one
        adding two more thumbnail related properties:
        
        - ``thumb_local_path`` - The local path of the image thumbnail
        - ``thumb_url`` - The url of the thumbnail
        
        Storing image with thumbnails is as easy as storing the file itself::
        
            from tgext.datahelpers.fields import Attachment, AttachedImage
            class Document(DeclarativeBase):
                __tablename__ = 'document'
        
                uid = Column(Integer, autoincrement=True, primary_key=True)
                image = Column(Attachment(AttachedImage))
        
            d = Document(image=open('/photo.jpg'))
            DBSession.add(d)
            DBSession.flush()
            DBSession.commit()
        
            d = DBSession.query(Document).first()
            print d.image.url
            '/attachments/d977144a-1a08-11e1-8131-001ff3d72e6b/aperto.tiff'
            print d.image.thumb_url
            'attachments/d977144a-1a08-11e1-8131-001ff3d72e6b/thumb.png'
        
        
        Thumbnail Options
        =======================================
        
        By default thumbnails will be generated with size 128, 128 and in PNG format.
        This can be changed by sublcassing the ``AttachedImage`` class and specifying
        the ``thumbnail_size`` and ``thumbnail_format`` attributes::
        
            class BigThumbnailAttachedImage(AttachedImage):
                thumbnail_size = (320, 320)
                thumbnail_format = 'jpg'
        
            class Document(DeclarativeBase):
                __tablename__ = 'document'
        
                uid = Column(Integer, autoincrement=True, primary_key=True)
                image = Column(Attachment(BigThumbnailAttachedImage))
