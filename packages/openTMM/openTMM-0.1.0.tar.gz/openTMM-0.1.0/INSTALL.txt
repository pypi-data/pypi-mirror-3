Linux/Unix/MacOS X Users:
-------------------------
1.  Download and untar openTMM-0.1.0.tar.gz and 'cd' into
    openTMM-0.1.0 directory, i.e., do:
      $ tar -xzvf openTMM-0.1.0.tar.gz
      $ cd openTMM-0.1.0/

2.  To install openTMM as a ROOT/ADMINISTRATOR try:
    2.1  python setup.py install

    2.2  If 2.1 fails then you probably have g77 [GNU project Fortran 77] 
         compiler installed and f2py is trying to use it to compile f95 code.
         Help Python find the correct Fortran compiler via:
           $ python setup.py config config_fc --fcompiler=gnu95 install

    2.3  If 2.2 fails then you probably don't have gnu95 compiler installed
         on your system.  The code should compiler with other compilers
         supported by f2py.  To find out which compilers are supported by
         f2py do the following:
           $ f2py -c --help-fcompiler
         Under "Fortran compilers found:" section you may have a list
         similar to:
         --fcompiler=absoft   Absoft Corp Fortran Compiler
         --fcompiler=compaq   Compaq Fortran Compiler
         --fcompiler=gnu95    GNU Fortran 95 compiler (4.4.4)
         --fcompiler=g95      G95 Fortran Compiler
         --fcompiler=intel    Intel Fortran Compiler for 32-bit apps
         --fcompiler=intele   Intel Fortran Compiler for Itanium apps
         --fcompiler=intelem  Intel Fortran Compiler for EM64T-based apps
         --fcompiler=lahey    Lahey/Fujitsu Fortran 95 Compiler
         --fcompiler=nag      NAGWare Fortran 95 Compiler
         --fcompiler=pg       Portland Group Fortran Compiler
         --fcompiler=vast     Pacific-Sierra Research Fortran 90 Compiler

         Keep trying:
           $ python setup.py config config_fc --fcompiler=xxx install
         where xxx is one of the available Fortran compilers.

3.  To install openTMM as a USER (no ROOT privileges):
    Do everything like in 2 but add --user at the end, i.e.,
      $ python setup.py install --user
    or
      $ python setup.py config config_fc --fcompiler=gnu95 install --user
    or
      $ python setup.py config config_fc --fcompiler=xxx install --user
    where xxx is one of the available Fortran compilers.  To find out 
    which compiler are supported by f2py do the following.
      $ f2py -c --help-fcompiler
    Under "Fortran compilers found:" section you may have a list
    similar to the one shown in 2.3       




Windows Users:
--------------
From Source:
1.  You must have C and Fortran 90/95 compiler installed,
    The easiest way to have the needed compilers and Python >= 2.5 
    on your system is to download Full Version of Python(x,y) from
    http://www.pythonxy.com/

2.  Assuming you have the Python(x,y) installed on your system.
    Do the following:

    2.1  Download and untar openTMM-0.1.0.tar.gz and 
         double click setup.py file inside the openTMM-0.1.0 directory.

    2.2  Set C compiler to mingw32 [GNU C compiler for Win32] 
         by entering this command:
           : cmingw32

    2.3  Set Fortran compiler to gnu95 [GNU Fortran 95 compiler]
         by entering this command:
           : fgnu95

    2.4  At this point everything should be ready for the install.
         Let Python know that you are ready to install 
         by entering this command:
           : 2

    2.5 Press 'Enter' one more time to do the actual install. 


From Binary:
1.  If you have Python 2.7 installed on your system then you 
    can download openTMM-0.1.0.win32-py2.7.exe and double click
    it to install openTMM.
