Description: flask-command - A tool to use a flask+gunicorn app from the command line
        ========================================================================
        
        flask-command is a simple tool that allows you to call your flask application
        from the command line after wrapping through gunicorn. This is useful if you'd
        like to create a ``console_script`` entry point for your flask application.
        
        Intended Use Case
        -----------------
        
        Let's assume your project is called myproject. A flask app exists or is
        accessible from myproject/__init__.py. The following shows how you'd use
        flask-command.
        
        In a file called myproject/main.py::
            
            from flaskcommand import flask_command
            from myproject import app
        
            main = flask_command(app)
        
        In your setup.py file::
            
            setup(name='myproject',
                version='0.0.1',
                description="myproject - is awesome",
                long_description="myproject - is really awesome",
                keywords='',
                author='Reuven V. Gonzales',
                author_email='reuven@tobetter.us',
                packages=['myproject'],
                include_package_data=True,
                zip_safe=False,
                install_requires=[
                    'flask-command',
                    'flask',
                ],
                entry_points={
                    'console_scripts': [
                        # WITH FLASK-COMMAND YOU CAN
                        # DEFINE YOUR SCRIPT HERE :-)
                        'myproject-web = myproject.main:main', 
                    ]
                },
                classifiers=[
                    'License :: OSI Approved :: MIT License',
                    'Intended Audience :: Developers',
                    'Programming Language :: Python',
                    'Topic :: Internet :: WWW/HTTP :: WSGI :: Application',
                ],
            )
        
        Now, after installing your project you can start your flask server like this::
            
            $ myproject-web -b 127.0.0.1:8000 -w 4 some_config_path
        
        At this time specifying a path to a configuration file is required, but this
        probably won't be so in the future.
