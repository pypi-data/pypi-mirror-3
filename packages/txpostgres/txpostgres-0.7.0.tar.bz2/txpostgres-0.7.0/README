This is txpostgres, a Twisted wrapper for asynchronous PostgreSQL
connections. It uses the asynchronous features of libpq, the
PostgreSQL C library, as exposed by psycopg2.

You can find more information about the psycopg2 Python driver at
http://initd.org/psycopg/. To use txpostgres you will need a recent version of
psycopg2, namely 2.2.0 or later.

txpostgres also requires Twisted, any reasonably recent version will do.

If you got txpostgres as a source tarball, you can run the automated test suite
and install the library with:
$ tar xjf txpostgres-x.x.x.tar.bz2
$ cd txpostgres-x.x.x
$ trial test
$ sudo python setup.py install

After that you can use txpostgres as a drop-in replacement for
twisted.enterprise.adbapi. The only difference is with connection pooling,
which is handled slightly different. Read the docstrings for the ConnectionPool
class for more details.
