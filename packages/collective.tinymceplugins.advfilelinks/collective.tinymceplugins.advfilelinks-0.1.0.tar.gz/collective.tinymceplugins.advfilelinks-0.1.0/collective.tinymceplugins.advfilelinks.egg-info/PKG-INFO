Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This is a plugin for `TinyMCE`__ editor for Plone.
        
        __ http://plone.org/products/tinymce/
        
        It will replace in the less obtrusive way the standard *plonelink* plugin, providing a version that
        handle in a different way links to File contents.
        
        When the link is not internal or not to a file, nothing change.
        
        When you link a file inside the Plone site, instead of obtain this in your XHTML...::
        
            <a class="internal-link" href="./my-pdf">Download the document</a>
        
        ...you'll get this...::
        
            <a class="internal-link internal-link-tofile" href="./my-pdf"
               type="application/pdf" title="pdf, 146.2 kB">Download the document</a>
        
        The plugin also add a CSS to your Plone site that:
        
        * Add the image icon based on file's mimetype, on the left of the link (need IE 7 or better)
        * After the linked text will be added a `text generated with CSS`__, with the same content you find in the
          *title*, put in bracket (need IE 8 or better).
          IE users with old version still get's some additional information thanks to the *title* attribute.

        TODO
        ====
        
        * A good uninstall GS step. Right now you must manually restore your default TinyMCE configuration.
        * More control on the plugin popup on what the user can show when creating the link
