1.0 (2011-11-27)
----------------

- Fixed problem: locks were not released when editing content and saving
  it without changing anything. Fixed by using new IEditFinishedEvent instead
  of IObjectModifiedEvent.

- Fixed problem which caused widget traversal to fail.
  The edit form is now protected for non-anonymous user, since locking for
  anyonmous users does not work anyway.

- Initial implementation
