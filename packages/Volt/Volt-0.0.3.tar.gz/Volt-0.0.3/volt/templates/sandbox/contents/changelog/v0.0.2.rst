Highlights
----------

* Preliminary support for more python versions: 3.2 and 2.6

* Preliminary support for rSt and textile plugins

* Default configuration name changes:

  - ``PACKS``          -> ``PAGINATIONS``
  - ``POSTS_PER_PAGE`` -> ``UNITS_PER_PAGINATION``
  - ``SORT``           -> ``SORT_KEY``


Others
------

* ``volt serve`` now generates the site first before serving any contents.

* PyYAML dependency removed.

* Pygments is now an optional dependency.

* Engines and Plugins now store their default settings as a class attribute.
  Users can override this by creating a Config object with the designated
  name (the value of the Engine/Plugin class attribute 'USER_CONF_ENTRY')
  in the project's voltconf.py.


Fixes
-----

* Windows terminal output does not display ANSI color codes anymore.

* Volt server regeneration now works if voltconf.py is changed.
