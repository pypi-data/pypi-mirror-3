Description: Kaylee
        ======
        
        Kaylee is distributed and volunteer in-browser computing framework.
        It is written in Python and CoffeeScript.
        
        
        Is it ready yet?
        ================
        
        Yes, as long as you stick to the provided API. Kaylee is currently
        in early development, but we're looking forward to stick with the
        API, especially the *Projects* part of it.
        
        
        Where are the docs?
        ===================
        
        Right here, in ``/doc``, or at http://kaylee.znasibov.info/docs
        
        I need help!
