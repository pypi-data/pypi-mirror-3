        ========

        Prerequisites
        =============
        
        To use ECQuiz you need:
        
        #. A current Plone installation, specifically Plone 3.x; check
           plone.org_ for details.
        
        #. The DataGridField_  product.  This version of ECQuiz has been 
           tested extensively with DataGridField version 1.6.  Newer 
           versions might or might not work as well.

        Installation
        ============
        
        See the `Installing an Add-on Product`_ tutorial for more detailed 
        product installation instructions.

        Installing with buildout
        ------------------------
        
        If you are using `buildout`_ to manage your instance you can install 
        ECQuiz by adding it to the eggs line for your instance::
        
          [instance]
          eggs =
              ... 
              Products.ECQuiz
        
        After updating the configuration you need to run ``bin/buildout``, 
        which will take care of updating your system.
        
        Then restart your zope instance and use the Add/Remove products page
        in Site Setup to install ECQuiz.
        
        .. _buildout: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zc.buildout
        
        
        Installing without buildout
        ---------------------------
        
        Move (or symlink) the ``ECQuiz`` folder of this project
        (``Products.ECQuiz/Products/ECQuiz``) into the ``Products`` directory 
        of the Zope instance it has to be installed for, and restart the 
        server.  Use the Add/Remove products page in Site Setup to install 
        ECQuiz.

        # Changes in release 1.4 (2011-10-31)
        
        - Added compatibility for Plone 4.  This version has not been tested 
          extensively with Plone 3 - it might or might not work as well.  Plone 3 
          users should use ECQuiz 1.2.1.
        
        - Reintegrated branch ``cewing_fix_imports`` which enables importing QTI 
          packaged-quizzes with support fpr zip files with pathnames in them.
        
        
        
        # Changes in release 1.2.1 (2010-04-16)
        
        - ECQuiz is now eggified and uploaded to PyPI.  An old-style 
          tarball distribution is still available at plone.org.
        
        
        # Changes in release 1.2 (2009-01-23)

        # Changes in release 1.1 (2007-07-16)
        
        - New question type: Scale questions can be used for Likert scales and
          similar response types.  Each answer is assigned a certain
          percentage of the total score for the question.  Scale questions can
          be displayed horizontally or vertically.
        
        - New *Quick Edit* function: Quick Edit enables you to quickly edit a
          complete quiz in textual form or to create it offline in a text
          editor.
        
        - Initial check-in of some unit tests for ECQuiz

          navigation between pages can be disabled
        
        - Grading scale, allowing you to map test scores to grades (or other
          categories)
