============================
 coopr.data.pyomo CHANGELOG
============================

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1.2.1
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Changing the baseline tests to use YAML.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1.2
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Adding logic to support the scoring of solvers (and solver
  interfaces). This can be launched via:

    coopr solvers —test

- Adding a problem to test that solvers generate a unique dual value.

- Adding a directory for performance test files.

- Migrating the coopr.pyomo p-median performance tests here.

- A rework of the solver testing engine. Options can now be passed to
  the test suite function, and the return value includes descriptions
  when checks pass AND fail. This allows for summaries of the solver
  checks that passed … which is often just as useful as the failures.

- Adding solver tests for MIP solvers.

- Adding tests to confirm whether solvers provide expected suffix information.

- Adding SOS test problems to the solver test suite.

- Adding a LP test problem with basic variables.

- Extend LP to allow for feasible status, and not just optimal.

- Added a new performance measure, which sums the % of checks passed for each
  problem.

- Removing glpk_new solver, which has been integrated into the glpk solver.

- Separating the LP tests that pertain to bounds checks, which are only
  pertinent when considering LP solvers.

- Clarifying testing intent for NLP solvers applied to LP problems. These
  solvers do not provide bounds information, since the do not know that
  they are solving an LP.

- Adding OpenOpt solver tests.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1.1.1
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Revising the baseline tests to weaken the requirements on value of
  the upper bound that is computed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1.1
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Added tests and corresponding baselines for various simple Pyomo models.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1.0
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Initial branch of coopr.data.pyomo, which archives Pyomo test models.
