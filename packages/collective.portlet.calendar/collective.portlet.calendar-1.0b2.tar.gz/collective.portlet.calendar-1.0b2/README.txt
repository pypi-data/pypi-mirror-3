Overview
--------

This package provides a configurable implementation of a Calendar Portlet.

It is possible to give the calendar portlet a header, to search only for
events with given keywords and constrain its results to only an area of your
site.

Even though Plone's default Calendar Portlet implementation is useful for most
sites if you want to segment calendar's events or to provide more than one
calendar per page, Extended Calendar Portlet comes to rescue.
