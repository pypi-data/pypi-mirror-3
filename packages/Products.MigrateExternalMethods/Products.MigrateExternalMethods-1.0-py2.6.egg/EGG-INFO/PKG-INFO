Description: MigrateExternalMethods is a simple product that migrates existing
        External Method objects to a module.
        
        This is because the Zope instance Extensions folder is missing in for
        example recent Plone buildouts.
        
        Install as an egg and then add the External Method with id migrate,
        module name MigrateExternalMethods and function name migrate.
        
        External methods that used to live in the Zope instance Extensions
        folder are moved into a product with an Extensions folder, and then
        the method can be run with the name of the product (without the
        "Products.") prefix.
