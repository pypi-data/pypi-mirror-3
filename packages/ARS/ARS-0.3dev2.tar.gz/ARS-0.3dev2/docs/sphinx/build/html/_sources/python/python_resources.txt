Python resources
==============================


Tutorials and guides
--------------------

If you would like to get a taste of Python get
started with `this tutorial <http://docs.python.org/tutorial/>`_
(included in the `official documentation <http://docs.python.org/>`_) which is very straight forward and does
not presume any previous knowledge of the language. However,
it is recommended to have at least Python installed (see next section).

Anothe way to get started from zero is the
`Beginner’s Guide to Python <http://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide>`_.


Python on Windows
--------------------
Although Python runs on Windows with no problems, sometimes it's difficult
to get started in this OS because of some small details that interfere with
what whould be a smooth process on a \*Nix system.

Syntax (e.g. path delimiters), permissions, end-of-line character, etc, can
stop the user from doing what he should be doing, i.e. learning the language,
instead of dealing with Windows annoyances (for more information on this topic,
go to `annoyances.org <http://www.annoyances.org/>`_).

That's why there is a special section on the Python documentation called
`Python on Windows FAQ <http://docs.python.org/faq/windows.html>`_. So, if you
are having issues with Python stuff on a Windows OS, go read that FAQ.


Python(x,y)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   `Python(x,y) <http://code.google.com/p/pythonxy/>`_
   is a free Python distribution providing a ready-to-use scientific
   development software for numerical computations, data analysis and data
   visualization based on Python programming language, Qt graphical user
   interfaces (and development framework) and Spyder interactive development
   environment. Its purpose is to help scientific programmers used to
   interpreted languages (such as MATLAB or IDL) or compiled languages
   (C/C++ or Fortran) to switch to Python.

It is very popular for Windows, but there is a
`GNU/Linux version <https://code.google.com/p/pythonxy-linux/>`_ too.


Python installation
--------------------
To have Python installed means you have installed a Python interpreter.
In a UNIX-like system (e.g. GNU-Linux, Mac OS, etc) you probably won't need to
because it is often included in the base installation. On Microsoft Windows,
however, it is not so you won't have it unless it was a dependency for some
software (e.g. GIMP).
Curious about that? Go read `Why is Python Installed on my Computer? FAQ <http://docs.python.org/faq/installed.html#why-is-python-installed-on-my-machine>`_


Online interpreters/shells
------------------------------

If you can't or don't want to install Python, you can resort to online
interpreters made available by some generous or commercial efforts. Here are free alternatives:

* The `repl.it project <http://repl.it/>`_ is an attempt to create an online environment for
  interactively exploring programming languages. It provides a fully-featured
  terminal emulator and code editor, powered by interpreter engines for more than
  15 languages.
  All our interpreters are written in (or compiled to) JavaScript, and run
  completely on the user's device, regardless or whether it's a desktop, laptop or
  phone.
* `PythonAnywhere <http://www.pythonanywhere.com/>`_ is a Python development and
  hosting environment that displays in
  your web browser and runs on our servers. They're already set up with everything
  you need. It's easy to use, fast, and powerful. There's even a useful free plan.
* Try `IPython from your browser <http://www.pythonanywhere.com/try-ipython/>`_!
  IPython is an enhanced interactive Python interpreter, offering tab completion,
  object introspection, and much more. It's running on the right-hand side of
  this page, so you can try it out right now.
*  `codepad <http://codepad.org/>`_ is an online compiler/interpreter, and a simple collaboration tool.
*  `Interactive server-side Python (2.5.2) shell for Google App Engine <http://shell.appspot.com/>`_
* `Ideone <http://ideone.com/>`_ is something more than a pastebin; it's an online compiler and debugging tool which allows
  to compile and run code online in more than 40 programming languages.

  Python is a general purpose, object-oriented programming language that has
  achieved popularity because of its readability and clear syntax. Guido van
  Rossum created Python in late 1980s. It is a ‘high level’ scripting language
  used by most programmers for its simplicity of use. Python can be written once
  and run on any computer. It’s a ‘multi paradigm programming language’
  compatible with many other programming languages such as .NET, CORBA, Java, Perl.

Open Source software projects by Dave Kuhlman.

  These projects are implemented in or for Python. These projects center around XML,
  parsing XML, etc. They provide tools for building data mapping and Web services.
  Keywords are: python, xml, editor, text processing, python training.
