Source Installation
===================

.. note::

	Packages are available for Debian/Ubuntu, RHEL/SL/Centos and
	Fedora if you are using one of those OS's rather install
	using the packages.

If you do not want to install to your global python directories
or are just testing it is advised that you use a `virtualenv`_ 
python install.

Virtualenv allows you to run multiple python installs and is 
easily managed as you do not need to be a privileged user to
install packages.

For more info on `virtualenv`_ please refer to its documentation.

Install Baruwa
==============

You can install Baruwa either via the Python Package Index (PyPI)
or from source.

Install via the Python Package Index (PyPI)
-------------------------------------------

To install using `pip`::

    # pip install baruwa

To install using `easy_install`::

    # easy_install baruwa

Downloading and installing from source
--------------------------------------

Download the latest version of Baruwa from `PyPI`_

You can install it by doing the following,::

    # tar xvfz baruwa-<version>.tar.gz
    # cd baruwa-<version>
    # python setup.py install

Using the development version
-----------------------------

You can clone the repository by doing the following::

    # git clone git://github.com/akissa/baruwa.git
    # cd baruwa
    # python setup.py install

Install the Python GeoIP module
-------------------------------

You need to install this manually as it does not build
cleanly when installed automatically during Baruwa's
installation::

	# wget http://geolite.maxmind.com/download/geoip/api/python/GeoIP-Python-1.2.4.tar.gz
	# tar xzvf GeoIP-Python-1.2.4.tar.gz
	# cd GeoIP-Python-1.2.4
	# python setup.py install

Link the Baruwa settings file to /etc/baruwa::

	# mkdir /etc/baruwa
	# baruwa_path=$(python -c "from distutils.sysconfig import get_python_lib; print get_python_lib()")
	# ln -s $baruwa_path/baruwa/settings.py /etc/baruwa/

.. include:: includes/rabbitmq.inc

.. include:: includes/configure_baruwa.inc

Link to the dojo toolkit::

	# ln -s /path/to/dojo $baruwa_path/baruwa/static/js
	# ln -s /path/to/dojox $baruwa_path/baruwa/static/js
	# ln -s /path/to/dijit $baruwa_path/baruwa/static/js

**Configure celeryd to run as a daemon**

You need to run celeryd as a daemon in order to process tasks such as
Bayesian learning and message releases from the quarantine etc etc.

Download the appropriate init script for your OS from the
`celery repository`_, then `read`_ the celery documentation
on how to run celeryd as a daemon on your specific OS. Make
sure you configure your system using the Django configuration
examples.

If you have any difficulties please refer to the Baruwa `mailing list`_
for assistance.

.. include:: includes/sigs-source.inc

Configure the Web server
------------------------

**Apache/mod_wsgi**

Make sure you have mod_wsgi installed and enabled.

Use the sample configuration provided (extras/baruwa-mod_wsgi.conf) 
as a template. Copy to your apache configuration directory usually
/etc/httpd/conf.d on Redhat and clones or /etc/apache2/conf.d/ on
debian and clones. For others refer to your system docs for the
location.

Make sure that your apache is configured for name based virtual
hosting such that you can run other sites on the same box if you
wish to.

Edit baruwa-mod_wsgi.conf and set ServerName to the hostname you
will use to access baruwa

.. note::

	If you installed using virtualenv, you need to customize and
	use virtual.wsgi instead of baruwa.wsgi in your mod_wsgi
	configuration.

Restart apache for the configuration to take effect.::

    # /etc/init.d/httpd reload

**Lighttpd**

Use the generic `Lighttpd`_ django instructions.

**Nginx**

Use the nginx instructions from the `nginx wiki`_

**Cherokee**

Use the `cherokee cookbook`_ instructions.
