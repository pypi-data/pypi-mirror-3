1.0rc4 (2012-01-03)
===================

- Update to newes Chameleon 2.7.1
- Using some Components/Expressions directly from Chameleon instead of z3c.pt


1.0rc3 (2011-07-14)
===================

- Rename megrok.chameleon into grokcore.chameleon to make it an official part
  of Grok.

1.0rc2 (2011-07-13)
===================

* Removed the zope.app.zcmlfiles test dependency.

1.0rc1 (2011-05-19)
===================

* Depend on the Chameleon 2.0 line.

* Depend on z3c.pt again, as it contains necessary components for the types
  of expressions we expect to be able to use in page templates in a Zope/Grok
  context. The maintainer for z3c.pt is the same as for Chameleon itself.

* Removal of the Genshi-template components, as they are not available in the
  Chameleon-2.0 line anymore.

* Grok's view namespaces are injected as "top-level" template namespaces
  instead of part of the `options` namespace.

0.5.2 (2010-07-19)
==================

* Remove dependency on chameleon.genshi as this is now included
  into Chameleon itself.

0.5.1 (2010-05-20)
==================

* Made registering of ITranslatorExpressions conditional: if
  ``z3c.pt`` is installed as well, we don't register our own
  ones. Should fix DuplicationError when using grokcore.chameleon
  together with other packages that require z3c.pt like ``z3c.form``
  and dependent packages from grok-ecosphere.

* Get rid of zope.testing, zope.app.testing and z3c.testsetup for
  tests.

0.5 (2010-03-03)
================

* Added tests to show usage of macros with ``grokcore.chameleon``.

* Removed dependency from ``z3c.pt`` by copying the relevant bits over
  and registering them locally.

  Drop support for ``exists('varname')`` expressions. The regular
  TALES expression ``exists: varname/path`` can still be used.

* Switch to use ``Chameleon`` instead of ``chameleon.*`` packages.

0.4 (2010-02-23)
================

* Declared ``megrok`` as namespace package.

* Fixed order of includes in ftesting.zcml.

* Moved pure test-requirements into own setup-section in order to reduce
  dependencies in regular (non-testing) mode.

0.3 (2010-02-14)
================

* Added license file.

0.2 (2009-09-18)
================

* Provide macro access from templates.

* Don't depend anymore on grok, but only grokcore.view.

* Added support for `path()` and `exists()` in page templates. This
  was introduced from `z3c.pt`.

* Fix ZCML includes.

0.1 (2009-02-22)
================

* Initial release
