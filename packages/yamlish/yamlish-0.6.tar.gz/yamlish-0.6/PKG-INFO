Description: 
        YAMLish is a small subset of YAML that TAP producers may use to embed machine readable
        information in TAP diagnostics. See TAP diagnostic syntax for information about how
        YAMLish embeds in TAP.
        
        ----------------------------
        Based on Data-YAML version 0.0.6 (Copyright (C) 2007, Andy Armstrong), but it
        is so thoroughly rewritten that I don't consider it derived work and I don't
        feel the need to resolve what "This library is free software; you can
        redistribute it and/or modify it under the same terms as Perl itself." actually
        means.
        
        Whole this package is licensed under MIT/X11 license (see header of yamlish.py
        for details).
