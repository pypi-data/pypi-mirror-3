===========

RangeParser is a Python package to parse ranges easily.

    import rangeparser

    parser = RangeParser()

    parser.parse('10,20,30')
    # => [10, 20, 30]

    parser.parse('1-10')
    # => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

    parser.parse('10,20,30,40-45')
    # => [10, 20, 30, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45]
