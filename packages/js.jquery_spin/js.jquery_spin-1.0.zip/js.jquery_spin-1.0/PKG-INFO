        **************
        
        Introduction
        ============
        
        This library packages `jquery.spin`_ for `fanstatic`_.
        
        .. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
        .. _`jquery.spin`: https://gist.github.com/1290439
        
        This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
        and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
        directory in ``js.jquery_spin``) are published to some URL.
        
        
        How to use?
        ===========
        
        
        You can import ``spin`` from ``js.jquery_spin`` and ``need`` it where you want
        these resources to be included on a page::
        
          >>> from js.jquery_spin import spin
          >>> spin.need()
