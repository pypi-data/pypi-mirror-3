Ella is opensource CMS based on Django framework,
designed for flexibility.

Althrough code is now used in production, we're now
still in pre-release stage. Feel free to play with code,
but do not expect it to be supported for production.

We'll be heading there soon.

Main repository lives in http://github.com/ella/ella/tree/master
