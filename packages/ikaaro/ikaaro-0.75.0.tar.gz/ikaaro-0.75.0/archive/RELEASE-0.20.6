ikaaro 0.20.6 (2008/07/22)
==========================

This is a Content Management System built on Python & itools, among
other features ikaaro provides:

 - content and document management (index&search, metadata, etc.)
 - multilingual user interfaces and content
 - high level modules: wiki, forum, tracker, etc.

This is a bug-fix release.  Among others, there are several fixes for
the tracker and for sending emails.  Also, TinyMCE has been upgraded
to the 3.0.9 version.

But maybe most important is the move of the web site to a new domain
name, now http://www.hforge.org/ will be hosting ikaaro and related
projects.
