        * :class:`.BuildModule`: Models build files
        * :class:`.Task`: Task instances (and other associated structures)
    * :func:`.build`: Runs the build


.. Note::

    :func:`.execute_in_vm` calls :func:`.stamp_environment` to set a number
    of environment variables before the call to :func:`.build`

.. _processor-execute:

Processor._execute implementation
---------------------------------

The :class:`.Processor` 'runs' a build using the following algorithm to
execute a single :class:`.Task`, recording activity in :class:`.Execution`
instances on a stack. The :class:`.Execution` states are defined in the
Enumeration :data:`dovetail.engine.STATE`:

    * Method **Processor._execute(self, task)**:

        1. **Begin**: Push a new :class:`.Execution` frame onto the stack

        2. **Check for errors**:

            2.1. Check if we have already run this task. If update the frame to STATE.REPEATED
               and go to #10

            2.2. Check if there is a circular invocation which has lead to
               an infinite recursion. If so, fail the build and go to #10

        3. **CWD**: Change working directory unless specifically disabled with
           ``@cwd(None)``

        4. **Directives**: Execute the :meth:`.TaskWrapper.before` method of
           all directives

        5. **Dependencies**: If :attr:`Execution.state` is not STATE.SKIPPED or STATE.FAILED:

            5.1. Loop over :meth:`.Task.dependencies`

                5.1.1. Recursive call to **Processor._execute()** to execute the :class:`.Task`.
                       If the execution was not successful (:meth:`.Execution.is_ok` is *False*),
                       fail this :class:`.Task` with STATE.ABORT and go to #8

        6. **CWD**: Check the working directory to ensure that anything the dependents did
           is reverted here before the main body of the :class:`.Task` runs

        7. **Body**: Execute the :class:`.Task` body by execute the function returned by
           :meth:`.Task.get_function()`

        8. **Directives**: Execute the :meth:`.TaskWrapper.after` method of all
           directives *in reverse order*

        9. If nothing went wrong, mark this :class:`.Execution` with STATE.SUCCEEDED

        10. **CWD**: Reset the working directory

        11. **End**: Pop the :class:`.Execution` stack frame

This method is heavily error-trapped and guarded - in the event that any failures
occur in the directives (in the :meth:`.TaskWrapper.before` and
:meth:`.TaskWrapper.after` methods) or the task dependencies or the task's function,
the method will catch the error and fail gracefully and safely.

.. Note::

    Exceptions raised during this process can trigger two different outcomes:

        1. If the exception occurs executing a :class:`.Task` function, then the
           :class:`.Task` is failed (STATE.FAIL), and the build is failed

        2. Otherwise, the exception must have come from the Dovetail framework, so
           the exception is propagated up the the highest level as a system failure.
