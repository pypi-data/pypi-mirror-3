        <small>A perverse HTTP client.</small>
    </h1>
</div>

<p>Pathoc is a perverse HTTP daemon designed to let you craft almost any
conceivable HTTP request, including ones that creatively violate the standards.
HTTP requests are specified using a <a href="/docs/language">small, terse
language</a>, which pathod shares with its server-side twin <a
href="/docs/pathod">pathod</a>. To view pathoc's complete range of options, use
the command-line help:</p>

    <pre class="terminal">pathoc --help</pre>

    <div class="page-header">
       <h1>Getting Started</h1>
    </div>
    
    <p>The basic pattern for pathoc commands is as follows: </p>

    <pre class="terminal">pathoc hostname request [request ...]</pre>

    <p>That is, we specify the hostname to connect to, followed by one or more
    requests. Lets start with a simple example:</p>
        
    <pre class="terminal">&gt; pathoc google.com get:/
&lt;&lt; 301 Moved Permanently: 219 bytes</pre>

    <p>Here, we make a GET request to the path / on port 80 of google.com.
    Pathoc's output tells us that the server responded with a 301. We can tell
    pathoc to connect using SSL, in which case the default port is changed to
    443 (you can over-ride the default port with the <b>-p</b> command-line
    option):</p>

    <pre class="terminal">&gt; pathoc -s google.com get:/
&lt;&lt; 301 Moved Permanently: 219 bytes</pre>

<section>
    <div class="page-header">
       <h1>Basic Fuzzing</h1>
    </div>

    <p>The combination of pathoc's powerful request specification language and
    a few of its command-line options makes for quite a powerful basic fuzzer.
    Here's an example:</p>

    <pre class="terminal">&gt; pathoc -t 2 -n 1000 localhost get:/:b@10:ir,@1</pre>

    <p>The request specified here is a valid GET with a body consisting of 10
    random bytes, but with 1 random byte inserted in a random place. This could
    be in the headers, in the initial request line, or in the body itself.
    Corrupting the request in this way will often make the server enter a state
    where it's awaiting more input from the client. This is where the <b>-t</b>
    option comes in, which sets a timeout that causes pathoc to disconnect
    after two seconds. Finally, the <b>-n</b> option tells pathoc to repeat the
    request 1000 times.</p>

    <div class="page-header">
       <h1>Interacting with Proxies</h1>
    </div>

    <p>At the moment, pathoc has no explicit support for proxies, but there's a
    workaround that serves many use cases. Instead of specifying just a path,
    specify an entire URL to the GET request, like so (assuming there's a proxy
    running on port 8080 of localhost):</p>

    <pre class="terminal">&gt; pathoc -p 8080 localhost "get:'http://google.com'"</pre>

    <p>Proxy support is going to be a major focus of development for the next
    version of pathoc, so keep an eye on the repo.</p>
