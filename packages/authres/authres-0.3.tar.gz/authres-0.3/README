This module (authres) is designed to provide support for RFC 5451,
http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5451,  processing in Python.

Header folding and unfolding is the responsibility of the calling application.

Between docstrings and RFC 5451 the API should be reasonably clear, but the
docstrings are still a work in progress.  The API is completely reworked from
version 0.1.

This package requires python2.6 or later (including python3).

This is completely untested on Windows, but in theory should work.
