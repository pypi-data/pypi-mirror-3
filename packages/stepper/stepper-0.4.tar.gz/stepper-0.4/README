This package provides Python control of stepper motors.  See Jones'
`Control of Stepping Motors`_ for an excellent stepper overview.
Supports full and half stepping of motors with one or two power lines
and 4 drains, or one or two drains and 4 power lines.  Basically any
motor with 4 variable lines, and it would be easy to extend it to
other cases.


Installation
============

Packages
--------

Gentoo
~~~~~~

I've packaged stepper for Gentoo.  You need layman_ and my `wtk
overlay`_.  Install with::

    # emerge -av app-portage/layman
    # layman --add wtk
    # emerge -av sci-libs/stepper


Dependencies
------------

Stepper has no explicit dependencies outside of the core Python
modules, but for real-world results you will need a way to drive the
stepper's digital control lines.  A general way to do this is with the
pycomedi wrapper around the Comedilib_ library, as shown in the
Stepper doctest.

You will also need nose for testing.
