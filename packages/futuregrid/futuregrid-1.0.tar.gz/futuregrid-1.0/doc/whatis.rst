What is FutureGrid Rain?
========================

Summary
-------

FutureGrid *Rain* is a tool that will allow users to place customized environments like virtual clusters or IaaS frameworks onto resources. 
The process of raining goes beyond the services offered by existing scheduling tools due to its higher-level toolset targeting 
virtualized and non-virtualized resources. Rain will be able to move resources from one infrastructure to another and compare the
execution of an experiment in the different supported infrastructures. 

In order to support Rain we need a flexible *Image Management* framework. Thus, Rain includes the FutureGrid Image Management framework which
defines the full life cycle of the images in FutureGrid. It involves the process of creating, customizing, storing, 
sharing, and registering images for different FG environments. To this end, we have several components to support the different tasks 
involved. First, we have an *Image Generation* tool that creates and customizes images according to user requirements. The second component 
is the *Image Repository*, which is in charge of storing, cataloging and sharing images. The last component is an *Image Registration* tool, 
which prepares, uploads and registers images for specific environments, like HPC or cloud frameworks. It also decides if an image is secure 
enough to be registered or if it needs additional security tests.

Image Management provides the low-level software needed to achieve Dynamic Provisioning and Rain. *Dynamic Provisioning* is in charge of 
allocating machines with the requested image. The requested image must have been previously registered in the infrastructure. On the other
hand, *Rain* will be our highest level component that will use Dynamic Provisioning and Image Management to provide custom environments 
that may or may not exist. Therefore, a Rain request may involve the creation, registration, and provision of one or more images in a set 
of machines.

Due to the variety of services and limited resources provided in FG, it is necessary to enable a mechanism to provision 
needed services onto resources. This includes also the assignment of resources to different IaaS or PaaS frameworks. 

Rain makes it possible to compare the benefits of IaaS, PaaS performance issues, as well as evaluating which applications 
can benefit from such environments and how they must be efficiently configured. As part of this process, we allow the 
generation of abstract images and universal image registration with the various infrastructures including Nimbus, Eucalyptus, 
OpenNebula, OpenStack, but also bare-metal via the HPC services. 
 
It is one of the unique features about FutureGrid to provide an essential component to make comparisons between the different 
infrastructures more easily possible. Rain will offers four main features:

* Create customized environments on demand.

* Compare different infrastructures.

* Move resources from one infrastructure to another by changing the image they are running plus doing needed changes in the framework.

* Ease the system administrator burden for creating deployable images.


Image Management
----------------

Image management is a key component in any modern compute infrastructure, regardless if used for virtualized or non-virtualized resources. We distinguish a number 
of important processes that are integral part of the life-cycle management of images. They include (a) image creation and customization, (b) sharing the images via 
a repository, (c) registering the image into the infrastructure, and (d) image instantiation. The problem of targeting not one, but multiple infrastructures amplifies
the need for tools supporting these processes. Without them, only the most experienced users will be able to manage them under great investment of time.

Image Generation
----------------

The image generation provides the first step in our image management process allowing users to create images according to their specifications. Since FG is a testbed 
that support different type of infrastructures like HPC or IaaS, the images created by this tool are not aimed to any specific environment. Thus, it is at the 
registration time when the images are customized to be successfully integrated into the desired infrastructure. This clear separation between image generation 
and registration provides a powerful model that allow us to independently increase the OS and infrastructures supported, respectively. Moreover, it 
reduces the amount of images that we need to manage in the image repository and therefore the disk usage.

The flowchart depicted in the next figure shows the process followed to create an image.

   :width: 400 px

Users initiate the process by specifying their requirements. These requirements can include the selection of the OS type, 
version, architecture, software, services, and more. First, the image generation tool searches into the image repository to identify a base image to be cloned, 
and if there is no good candidate, the base image is created from scratch. Once we have a base image, the image generation tool installs the software required by
the user. This software must be in the official OS repositories or in the FG software repository. The later contains software developed by the FG team or other 
approved software. The installation procedure can be aided by Chef, a configuration management tool to ensure the software is installed and configured properly. 
After updating the image, it is stored in the image repository and becomes available for registration into one of the supported infrastructures. Our tool is general
to deal with installation particularities of different operating systems and architectures.


.. _sec_imagerepo:

Image Repository
----------------

The image repository catalogs and stores images in a unified repository. It offers a common interface for distinguishing image types for different IaaS frameworks 
but also bare-metal images. This allows us to include a diverse set of images contributed not only by the FG development team but also by the user community that 
generates such images and wishes to share them. The images are augmented with information about the software stack installed on them including versions, libraries, 
and available services. This information is maintained in the catalog and can be searched by users and/or other FG services. Users looking for a specific image can discover
available images fitting their needs using the catalog interface. 

The information associated to the images is stored using the fields collected in the next table.

Image Registration
------------------

Once the image has been created and stored into the repository, we need to register it into the targeted infrastructure before we can instantiate it. Users 
requirements are simply the image, the targeted infrastructure and the kernel. The kernel is an optional requirement that allows advance users to select
the most appropriate kernel for their experiments. This tool provides a list of available kernels organized by infrastructure. Nevertheless, users may request 
support for other kernels like one customized by them. Registering an image also includes the process of adapting it for the infrastructure. Often we find 
differences between them requiring us to provide further customizations, security check, the upload of the image to the infrastructure repository, and registering
it. The process of adaptation and registration is depicted in Figure 4 in more detail. These customizations include the configuration of network IP, DNS, file 
system table, and kernel modules. Additional configuration is performed depending on the targeted deployed infrastructure. 

.. image:: ImageRegistration_detail.png

   :width: 400 px

In the HPC infrastructure the images are converted to network bootable images to be provisioned on bare-metal machines. Here, the customization process configures 
the image, so it can be integrated into the pool of deployable images accessible by the scheduler. In our case this is Moab. Hence, if such an image is specified 
as part of the job description the scheduler will conduct the provisioning of the image for us. These images are stateless and the system is restored by
reverting to a default OS once the running job requiring a customized image is completed. 

Images targeted for cloud infrastructures need to be converted into VM disks. These images also need some additional configuration to enable VM’s 
contextualization in the selected cloud. Our plan is to support the main IaaS clouds, namely Eucalyptus, Nimbus, OpenStack, OpenNebula, and Amazon
Web Service (AWS). As our tool is extensible, we can also support other cloud frameworks.
