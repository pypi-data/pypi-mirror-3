        ==================
        
          This product allows you to share roles about a specific Plone content to an 
          unregistered user through a link.
        
          TokenRole use borg.localrole to assign localroles in context.
          
          PAS Plugin which can assign localroles on a context to anonymous 
          users providing a specific token is provided.
          
          After you install redomino.tokenrole through Plone Control Panel, go to
          any Plone Page and activate TokenRole support using the specific
          action in the content actions menu.
          
          A new content tab will appear to let you manage your tokens on that
          page: create a new one leaving there what the system suggests or
          modifying it as you need. Now try to access the provided url with
          an unpriviledged user and you'll get the role you granted on that context.

          Incredibly easy was to have this work done starting out from AutoRole 
          product and its PAS plugin, and of course many thanks to borg.localrole
          for the incredibly easy way of providing localroles on context.
        
          Thanks to Fabrizio Reale, Redomino and ITCILO for inspiring and sponsoring this
          effort.
          
          First implemented by Maurizio Delmonte.
