Description:           This module is used to hook up pdb_, the python debugger, with BBEdit_, a
                  text editor for Mac OS X, enabling it to display the
                  debugged source code during a pdb_ session.
        
                    .. _pdb: http://docs.python.org/lib/module-pdb.html
                    .. _BBEdit: http://barebones.com/
        
                  After downloading and unpacking the package, you should install the helper
                  module using::
        
                      $ python setup.py install
        
                  Next you need to hook up pdb_ with this module by add the following to your
                  ``.pdbrc``::
        
                      from PdbBBEditSupport import preloop, precmd
                      pdb.Pdb.preloop = preloop
                      pdb.Pdb.precmd = precmd
        
                  The easiest way to do this is to use the provided script::
        
                      $ pdbbbsupport enable
        
                  Alternatively you can also do it manually.  The ``.pdbrc`` is located in your
                  home folder and possibly needs to be created first.  You may also use the
                  supplied sample configuration file for pdb_ to enable the hook like::
        
                      $ cp pdbrc.sample ~/.pdbrc
        
                  Afterwards BBEdit_ should get started automatically whenever you enter a
                  debug session.  The current source line will be displayed simultaneously while
                  stepping through the code.  However, having the cursor moved automatically
                  within that source file is not always very obvious, so you might want to use
                  the "Highlight insertion point: Line color" feature, which can be enabled in the "Text Colors"
                  tab in BBEdit's preferences.
