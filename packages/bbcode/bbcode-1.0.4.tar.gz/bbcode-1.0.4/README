Advantages Over Postmarkup
==========================

* More tag options for how/when to escape - for instance, you can specify
  whether to escape html or perform cosmetic replacements on a tag-by-tag
  basis. Same for auto-linking and transforming newlines.

* More liberal (and accurate) automatic link creation, using John Gruber's
  URL regular expression:
    http://daringfireball.net/2010/07/improved_regex_for_matching_urls

* Does not swallow unrecognized tags. For example, [3] will be output as
  [3], not silently ignored.

* More flexible tag option parser. Tags may have standard bbcode options,
  for example [url=something]text[/url], but may also have named options,
  for example [url=something alt=icon]text[/url]. These options are passed
  to the render function as a standard python dictionary.

* Ability to specify tag opening and closing delimiters (default: [ and ]).
  A side benefit of this is being able to use this library to selectively
  strip HTML tags from a string by using < and >.

* Includes a runnable unittest suite.
