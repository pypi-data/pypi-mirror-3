Standard Commands

Because PowerConsole is primarily designed as host system for user defined commands, the core distribution
provides only handful of commands. All built-in command keywords are **case insensitive**.

SET TERM
========

PowerConsole supports two types of command definitions:

1. Commands terminated with special text sequence - `terminator` (for example SQL commands has to be terminated
   by ‘;’)
2. Commands without terminator sequence.

The default terminator is ';' and could be changed by directly assigning new value to
:attr:`~pwc.interpreter.Interpreter.Terminator` attribute 

PowerConsole also implements command SET TERM to change the command terminator sequence in interactive sessions.

Syntax::

    SET TERM <new-terminator> <current-terminator>
