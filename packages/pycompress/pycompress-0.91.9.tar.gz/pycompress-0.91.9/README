This is a module which provides 3 functions,
compress, uncompress and listarchive
to compress and uncompress in a very high compression ratio
at the range of upto 10:1.

This library can be used for very relevant application domains, like logging
compression, backup compression, and other archival purposes, as the compression ratio is very high.


HOWTO
-----

    from pycompress import compress

    compress(source,destination,[options, logfile]) #compress a file

    listarchive(filename,[logfile]) # list info on an archive

    decompress(destination, source, [options. logfile]) # decompress a file


Algorithm behind is Matt Mahoney's ZPAQ algorithm.
There are some known issues with setup, for non POSIX systems, and for such
machines, you can install the zpaq algorithm from source, make it available
to the wrapper, and you can use it. Please contribute to the packaging, if you
have some time to spare.


Thanks for using pycompress. More documentation to follow.
