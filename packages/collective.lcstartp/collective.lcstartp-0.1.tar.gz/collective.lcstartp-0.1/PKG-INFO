Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        Linkchecking is a common task for content editors.
        Linkcheckers normally go through your site recursivly which
        will result in many pages to be checked several times. The
        linkchecker start pages tries to avoid this by giving the
        linkchecker a page from which every relevant content item can be reached.
        
        Configuration
        --------------
        
        In the controlpanel you can define which item types will be listed on
        the link checker start page. The startpage itself is reachable at
        http://yourdomain.tld/@@linkchecker_startpage_view.html. This page also
        gives you an example how to use it with http://linkchecker.sourceforge.net/
