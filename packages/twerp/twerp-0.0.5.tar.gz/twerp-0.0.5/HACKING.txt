Twerp is on #twerp via Freenode, IRC - come collaborate.


Development setup
=================

I use 'gitflow' Git extensions to provide high-level repository operations for
Vincent Driessen's branching model.

Don't care about that? Then, basically, watch the 'develop' branch on github. The 'master' branch only
contains stable tagged versions.


Release HOWTO
=============

To make a release, 

  1) Update release date/version in NEWS.txt, setup.py and src/twerp/__init__.py
  
  2) Configure tox.ini to use multiple python versions. The one in git is for
  the Jenkins continuous integration running at http://cakebread.info/jenkins.
  Only modify that in git if you're working on Jenkins.

  3) Run 'tox' to build and test using multiple Python versions

  4) Upload to PyPI: 'python setup.py sdist register upload'

  5) Increase version in setup.py and src/twerp/__init__.py (for next release)
