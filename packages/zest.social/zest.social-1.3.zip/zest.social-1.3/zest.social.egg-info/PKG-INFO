Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This is yet another social bookmarking viewlet based on
        http://www.addthis.com/
        Why a new one and not for example `collective.addthis`_?  Well,
        probably just because it is so easy to generate the javascript with
        the services we choose, and register this as a viewlet.  We did that
        for our own `Zest Software`_ site and a client wanted the same, but
        then with s checkbox per page to turn it on or off.
        
        
        Features
        ========
        
        - This gives you a viewlet near the bottom of the page with links to
          share this on LinkedIn, Twitter or Google; you can share on some other
          sites in a popup; plus a print button.
        
        - Also, you get an extra boolean field ``show_social_viewlet`` on the
          edit page (the Settings tab) of content types (using
          ``archetypes.schemaextender``).  When this field is checked, the viewlet
          is shown.  By default the field is not checked, so the viewlet is
          not shown.
        
        - The extra field and the viewlet are only available when
          you have actually installed this Add-On in your Plone Site (this is
          done using plone.browserlayer).  So when your Zope instance has more
          than one Plone Site, the viewlet is only used in the site where you
          install it.
        
        
        Configuration
        =============
        
        There is no configuration in the UI.  If you want to override the
        default value and fallback value for showing the viewlet you may want
        to look at ``config.py`` and do a monkey patch on the values there.
        
        If you want to change the links that are shown, you should just
        override the viewlet template, which is probably easiest using
        `z3c.jbot`_.
        
        
        Compatibility
        =============
        
        ``zest.social`` has been tested with Plone 3.3. and Plone 4.0, using
        `archetypes.schemaextender`_ 1.6 and 2.0.3.

        Changelog
        =========
        
        1.3 (2012-09-12)
        ----------------
        
        - Moved to github.
          [maurits]
        
        
        1.2 (2010-10-19)
        ----------------
        
        - Added MANIFEST.in file so the released package will contain ``.mo``
          files (at least when using ``zest.releaser`` in combination with
          ``zest.pocompile``).
          [maurits]
        
        - When context.show_social_viewlet does not work, try 
          context.getField('show_social_viewlet').get(context)
          as somehow the first only works when you have called getField once.
          Tested with archetypes.schemaextender 1.6 and 2.0.3.
          [maurits]
        
        - Added config.py to ease overriding the 
          default value for the show_social_viewlet field (False)
          and the fallback value for when the field does not exist for the
          current object (False).
          [maurits]
        
        
        1.1 (2010-10-18)
        ----------------
        
        - Explicitly load the zcml of the archetypes.schemaextender package so
          you do not need to add this yourself to your buildout config on
          Plone 3.2 or earlier.
          [maurits]
        
        
        1.0 (2010-10-18)
        ----------------
        
        - Initial release.  [maurits]
