__all__ = ['linearize_model_expressions', 'is_linear_expression_constant']

# a prototype utility to translate from a "normal" model instance containing
# constraints and objectives with expresssions for their bodies, into a
# more compact linearized verson of the problem. eliminates the need for
# canonical expressions and the associated overhead (memory and speed).

# NOTE: Currently only works for constraints - leaving the expressions alone,
#       mainly because PH doesn't modify those and I don't want to deal with
#       that aspect for the moment. In particular, this only works for
#       immutable parameters due to the reliance on the canonical expression
#       generator to extract the linear and constant terms.
