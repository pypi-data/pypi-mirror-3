js.html5shiv
************

Introduction
============

This library packages `html5shiv`_ for `fanstatic`_.

.. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
.. _`html5shiv`: https://github.com/aFarkas/html5shiv

This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
directory in ``js.html5shiv``) are published to some URL.
