"""
Underverse is named after the destination and afterlife of the Necromonger's from the
Chronicles of Riddick. This module is so named because the author likes the movie.

The Underverse is an Object Document Mapper, or ODM. An ODM performs roughly the same
functions for unstructured data as an ORM (Object Relational Mapper) does for relational
data minus the 'relationships'...

In Python, SQLAlchemy is the ORM of choice. The Underverse follows the same
design principles seen in SQLAlchemy. So if you've used it before, this module
should feel right at home.

.. note::

  Underverse is now **beta** due to the arrival of v0.3. However, there may still be uncovered bugs or unexpected errors waiting to be found. I'm continually working to increase the test coverage and to update the docs.

  If bugs are found, please join the `Google Group <http://groups.google.com/group/python-underverse>`_ and post the issue. Suggestions are also welcome. The project will be on github soon.


.. warning::

  Underverse underwent a tremendous maturation process between versions 0.2.3 and 0.3. Therefore, if you downloaded an earlier version, it would greatly benefit you to upgrade to the latest version.

What is Underverse?
===================

At it's core, the Underverse is a JSON-based document store built on top of SQlite. JSON was chosen over pickle because of it's size, simplicity, readability and speed. These features, combined with SQlite, make for a simple and elegant solution. Everything in the Underverse is written to use Python's generators to provide for a streamlined process for data access and manipulation. The module provides ways to quickly load, update, group, map and filter data.

To avoid some mis-conceptions, here's what it is and what it's not:

**Underverse is**:

  * Fast, easy, simple and clean
  * A zero-configuration solution
  * Extremely light-weight
  * Specialized

    * Think of a Knife, not a Low Orbit Ion Cannon
    * Agile, not encumbered by over-bearing features

  * Lean, very lean
  * **A wicked-sick, data-analysis module**
  * **NOT** a do-everything module
  * **NOT** into *keeping up with the Joneses*
  * **NOT** a NoSQL client-server solution

    * if you want one, you'd have to wrap it yourself (or use one that already works and save yourself a headache)

  * **NOT** a full NoSQL solution

    * it has no indexes
    * it has no built-in replication
    * it has no sharding-capability

  * **NOT** a solution for anyone with high-availability needs (again, not a client-server solution)


The Underverse was designed to be **an analysis module**. It was engineered to be a defense for low-strafing questions on Friday @ 440 PM. It was built to answer questions *FAST*. With this in mind and by using NoSQL / Post-modern document storage principles, the Underverse can evolve over time allowing for increasingly deeper questions to be asked of the data it houses.

  **Author's Advice**:

    You'll do yourself a favor by remembering what this module was designed for. Every weapon has a specific purpose, use them for what they were built for in order to construct your own arsenal for dispatching problems and questions from customers.

  Do that and your boss won't know whether to hug you or kiss you. Hopefully neither if your boss is like most. That's also assuming you are not his (or her - for the PC crowd) secretary... Heck, you might even land a raise or two or three.

Introduction
============

These next few sections outline possible points of familiarity for those who have worked with relational databases or other NoSQL data stores. I've also included a section comparing Underverse and SQL-Alchemy. As I've said before, if you've used SQL-Alchemy before then you should see some similarities.

Organization / Lingo

Here are the relationships between the objects found in Underverse and a traditional RDBMS, as well as their counter-parts using NoSQL-speek:

SQL-Alchemy Comparison
----------------------

Underverse's query syntax is similar to SQLAlchemy's. However, Underverse removes some of the complexity of getting started.

But before I go any further, understand that Underverse is NOT meant to battle SQL-Alchemy in hand-to-hand combat.
There are many, many things that SQL-Alchemy does that are top-notch in the ORM world, most of which will never be covered in Underverse.
I have really enjoyed using SQL-Alchemy in the past. However, some, perhaps even most, projects can get away with using a much
lighter-weight approach to managing data. Underverse is meant to fill that niche.

Here's a comparison for those of you who are familiar to SQL-Alchemy:

**SQLAlchemy**::

  from sqlalchemy import create_engine, Column, Integer, String
  from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base
  from sqlalchemy.orm import scoped_session, sessionmaker

  Base = declarative_base()

  class User(Base):
      __tablename__ = 'users'

      id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
      name = Column(String)
      fullname = Column(String)
      password = Column(String)

      def __init__(self, name, fullname, password):
          self.name = name
          self.fullname = fullname
          self.password = password

      def __repr__(self):
         return "<User('%s','%s', '%s')>" % (self.name, self.fullname, self.password)

  session = scoped_session(sessionmaker(bind=create_engine('sqlite:///:memory:', echo=False)))

  ed_user = User('ed', 'Ed Jones', '3d5_p455w0r6')
  session.add(ed_user)

Let's take a look at everything that's happening. Before you can do anything you
have to define a data model. In the example case, the ``User`` class is defined
with first name, full name and password fields.

Next, a session is created to operate on. Then a ``User`` object is instantiated
and finally added to the session.

**Underverse**::

  from underverse import Underverse

  uv = Underverse()
  users = uv.users

  ed_user = { 'name': 'ed', 'fullname':'Ed Jones', 'password':'3d5_p455w0r6'}
  users.add(ed_user)

Ok, at first glance you can see a large difference in the lines of code required.
Let's talk about what Underverse is doing.

When ``uv = Underverse()`` is called, a connection to an in-memory SQLite database
is made behind the scenes. Then a table is created by using
``users = uv.user``. No class structure or data model is needed to insert data.
Then to insert data, you simply call ``users.add(ed_user)``.

However, with the advent of v0.3, class objects are officially supported. Therefore, you can also do this.

.. code-block:: python

  uv = Underverse()
  test = uv.test

  class User(object):
    def __init__(self, name, fullname, password):
        self.name = name
        self.fullname = fullname
        self.password = password

  ed_user = User('ed', 'Ed Jones', '3d5_p455w0r6')
  test.add(ed_user)

Storing class instances are as painless as can be. **There is NO need for a base class** (unless you have need of one, of course).
Underverse doesn't need any help with the encoding of documents. However, when decoding objects please see the ``create_mapper``
function.

.. note::

  Yes, I understand that SQL-Alchemy is an ORM and Underverse is not. The above was simply
  to show the differences of loading data.

  Please, don't send me hate mail.

Querying Preview
----------------

Using the same SQL-Alchemy code above, here's how querying is handled in both frameworks. Again, this is NOT a replacement for SQL-Alchemy, but rather a lighter-weight approach data storage and retrieval.

**SQL-Alchemy**::

  session.query(User).filter(User.fullname=='Ed Jones')

This statement finds all rows in the ``users`` table where ``fullname == 'Ed Jones'``.

Similarly **Underverse** does this::

  from underverse.model import Document
  users.find(Document.name == 'ed')

When using Underverse, the ``Document`` class is the main query object. It handles all document queries for every document collection. There's no need to create a class for every table or collection.

Additional Key-Value Functionality
----------------------------------

Underverse now has basic key-value storage methods. This can be used for many things, however, perhaps storing script options might be useful along with using the module for it's document storage capabilities as well.

Here's a preview of the key-value functionality. The ``KeyValue`` class will have a more detailed description of the existing capability.

.. code-block:: python

  uv = Underverse()
  options = uv.options

  # Add key by using the ``put`` method
  options.put('key', 'value')

  # Get the associated value
  print options.get('key')

  #This raises a KeyError.
  print options.get('key2')

This class adds support for storing key-value documents.

The key-value storage is built on top of the current document
infrastructure. Each document has a *UUID*, a *created_at* and
*updated_at* attributes.

Key-Value documents override the UUID variable with a custom
user-defined value. Where as the 'value' portion is stored
like all other documents.

Adding and getting keys and there values is simple:

this object contains most of the logic in terms of filtering, grouping and mapping data.

Searches verse using SQlite GLOB statements. This is used to limit the number of documents being queried for.

**Example usage:**

For example, say you have an unstructured CSV (comma separated values) file with
network traffic. The file has several different types of logging messages with
both received and transmitted messages. You need to search for a specific
logging message, but there's a lot of data and converting all the extra messages
would be pointless and time consuming. Here's how you would filter out the extra
messages and then group by IP address.

.. code-block:: python

  uv = Underverse()
  uv.load("logs.sql")
  logs = uv.logs

  #finds all WARNING messages that were received
  warnings_received = logs.glob('rxnet', 'WARNING')

  # groups the warnings by IP
  for ip, warnings in warnings_received.groupby("ip"):
    print '\\nIP Address: ' + str(ip)

    for warning in warnings:
      print ' - Description: ' + str(warning.desc)

.. admonition:: Performance Hint
  :class: perf


    Use this whenever you can to gain a slight performance boost. Because this
    function uses SQlite's GLOB functionality, the documents can be searched before
    they are converted to python dictionary.

    However, querying and globbing speed can be increased by intellegently ordering query parameters.
    In Underverse, if one condition fails, then the record is skipped without processing the other conditions.
    Therefore, use the more strict conditions first.

  .. code-block:: python

    # globbing - 2.297s
    warnings_received = logs.glob('WARNING', 'rxnet')

    # faster globbing - 1.141s
    warnings_received = logs.glob('rxnet', 'WARNING')

    # querying - 2.313s
    warnings_received = logs.find(D.Message_Label == "WARNING", D.rx_tx_net == 'rxnet')

    # faster querying - 2.218s
    warnings_received = logs.find(D.Message_Label == "WARNING", D.rx_tx_net == 'rxnet')

  The code above searched 50k+ network messages and the times shown are the min of 3 runs.

**One possible usage..**

Say you have a website where members can comment on blog posts. You
want to run some stats on how many posts each user has commented on.
But when you were building your site you didn't think about that...

Let's say that you have already loaded your members into an Underverse
instance. Being the brilliant coder you are, you have also given each
member a list of their comments as well. You just want to add a comment
count. Here's one way to do it.

.. code-block:: python

  # connect to SQlite database
  uv = Underverse("web.db")

  #select members table
  members = uv.members

  #update every member in collection
  for member in members:

    #assuming each member has a list of comments under member.comments
    #the same syntax is used for adding a new attribute of updating an existing attribute
    member.comment_count = len(member.comments)

    #update document: collection.update(document)
    members.update(member)

Bulk operations are normally faster. This is how you could do the same thing using bulk updates.

.. code-block:: python

  uv = Underverse("web.db")
  members = uv.members

  #create a list of documents to be updated
  updated = []

  #update every member in the collection
  for member in members:

    #assuming each member has a list of comments under member.comments
    #the same syntax is used for adding a new attribute of updating an existing attribute
    member.comment_count = len(member.comments)

    # add member to the list to be updated
    updated.append(member)

    # incremental updates can be achieved like so
    # updating every 2500 documents
    if len(updated) % 2500 == 0:
      members.update(updated)

      #don't forget to clear the queue
      updated = []

  # commit any remaining documents in queue
  members.update(updated)

.. admonition:: Performance Hint
  :class: perf


    Bulk updates are faster because SQlite is handling more of
    the work. Any time you can limit function calls, do it.

.. warning::

  The 'purify' function requires that NumPy is installed.

.. note::

  **Design History**:

    Just as an FYI, before Underverse was started, I worked on another analysis module
    called bops. *bops* has similar functionality as Underverse, however, it is
    limited to rectangular datasets. Bops used NumPy as it's foundation and was blazing fast
    because of it. However, it was also a memory hog. Many of the design features seen in
    Underverse were originally 'fleshed out' in *bops*.

    I have rewritten the core of *bops* and added it as an extension to Underverse.
    It is called the ``QuasiDead``.

    This extension allows for a subset of a Verse to be shoved temporarily into NumPy to give the
    coder access to the added functionality NumPy provides. In order for this to work, the chosen
    attributes are sliced from the document collection and molded into a structured data set
    which NumPy can handle.

    Each ``QuasiDead`` instance can also be grouped, ordered and filtered.

.. admonition:: Performance Hint
  :class: perf


    'Purifying' data does not result in any noticeable speed increase in the grouping, filtering
    and sorting of data. To the contrary, it's been my experience that Python's built-in generators outperform NumPy. This is
    mainly due to the cost of creating a recarray from the document store. Therefore, the only reason to 'purify' your data
    would be to make use of some of NumPy's functionality.

.. code-block:: python

  uv = Underverse()
  uv.load('data.sql')

  data = uv.data

  # creates a numpy recarray with 4 columns captured from the documents in the 'data' collection
  qd = data.purify('name', 'age', 'gender', 'country')

  # the new QuasiDead instance has limited functionality outside of it's code ``numpy.recarray``.
  # However, grouping and ordering can be achieved the same way as a document collection in Underverse.
  for country, citizens in qd.groupby('country'):
    print country, len(citizens)

  # numpy string array
  names = qd.name

.. seealso::

  Please look at the QuasiDead documentation for more information on what this unique class can be used for.

a representation of an actual application, but rather an example of
the existing support for nested class structures. The JSON is
decoded flawlessly to reveal nearly exact duplicates of the objects
that were encoded originally. The only difference are the memory
spaces they reside in.

.. note::

  This method is **ONLY** required if the loading and reading of the
  persisted documents happen in different scripts. Otherwise, Underverse
  will remember the object classes from when they were loaded originally.
