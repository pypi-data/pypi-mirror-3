Description: 
        netbytes
        ===============
        
        The *netbytes* module aims to offer an easy way to handle the bytes exchanded
        beetween server and clients.
        
        .. warning::
        
            *netbytes* does not replace the module socket, nor package twisted or
            alike. It only manages the *str* exchanged via network ; in fact, you may
            very well not doing any networking at all, it doesn't care because
            **technicaly, it has nothing to do with networking**, even if designed to
            operate in such context.
        
        As servers and clients can only exchange *str*, there is a need to
        establish an arbitrary convention for representing instructions, informations,
        data, etc... into *str*. A common technic, is to reserve the first bytes
        of the string to this purpose, and the rest of the string to contain data. And
        even this data must be rigourously encoded by an arbitrary convention... If not
        properly handled, the readability can quickly be a mess, and a nightmare to
        maintain.
        
        This is where *netbytes* aims to be handfull : it creates a tree of all the
        type of bytes that can be exchanged beetween clients and server from a model
        easy to understand, and quick to design. The nodes of this tree can then be
        called to produce a string ready to be sent. And on the reciever side, this
        string can be processed by the tree, which call the appropriate handler. This
        way, the programmer spends less time in writing code to decode and interpret
        the recieved string of bytes, and the source code become a lot more readable,
        and maintainable.
