Introduction
============

plonetheme.bootstrap integrates the bootstrap css/js framework
into plone. You can checkout the framework at `http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/`

It overrides some templates and uses javascript to transform
some markup in order for it to work correctly.

It's not perfect, but it's close.
