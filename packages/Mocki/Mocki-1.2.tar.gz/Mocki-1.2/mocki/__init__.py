"""An easy-to-use but full featured mocking library for Python.

Here is a short example showing how to start working with Mocki :
    >>> from mocki.expectations import once
    >>> from mocki.matchers import thatCall

    >>> mock = Mock('theMock')

    >>> mock.verify(thatCall(1, 2, 3, x=7, y=8, z=9)).invoked(once())
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    AssertionError: No call invoked from theMock up to now.

    >>> mock(1, 2, 3, x=7, y=8, z=9)

    >>> mock.verify(thatCall(1, 2, 3, x=7, y=8, z=9)).invoked(once())

"""
import collections, threading

class Mock(object):
    """A mock is a callable object that is able to track any call invoked from
    it and that will automatically provide on-fly generated mock members from
    each non existing member accessed.

    To use it, first instanciate a mock giving it a name, then invoke some calls
    from it, with or without args and kwargs :
        >>> mock = Mock('theMock')

        >>> mock()
        >>> mock(1, 2, 3)
        >>> mock(x=7, y=8, z=9)
        >>> mock(1, 2, 3, x=7, y=8, z=9)

    Now, we can ask to verify whether or not a given call was invoked from it :
        >>> from mocki.expectations import once
        >>> from mocki.matchers import thatCall

        >>> mock.verify(thatCall(1, 2, 3, x=7, y=8, z=9)).invoked(once())

    In case of verification failure, an assertion error will be raised with a
    debugging-friendly message indicating the problem :
        >>> mock.verify(thatCall(7, 8, 9, x=1, y=2, z=3)).invoked(once())
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        AssertionError: Found no matching call invoked from theMock up to now :
           1  theMock()
           2  theMock(1, 2, 3)
           3  theMock(x=7, y=8, z=9)
           4  theMock(1, 2, 3, x=7, y=8, z=9)

    You can also invoke some calls from its mock members :
        >>> mock.method()
        >>> mock.otherMethod(1, 2, 3)
        >>> mock.method(x=7, y=8, z=9)
        >>> mock.otherMethod(1, 2, 3, x=7, y=8, z=9)

    Now, we can ask to verify whether or not a given call was invoked from any
    of its mock members :
        >>> mock.otherMethod.verify(thatCall(1, 2, 3, x=7, y=8, z=9)).invoked(once())

    In case of verification failure, an assertion error will be raised with a
    debugging-friendly message indicating the problem :
        >>> mock.otherMethod.verify(thatCall(7, 8, 9, x=1, y=2, z=3)).invoked(once()) # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        AssertionError: Found no matching call invoked from theMock.otherMethod up to now :
           6  theMock.otherMethod(1, 2, 3)
           8  theMock.otherMethod(1, 2, 3, x=7, y=8, z=9)

    Actually, since mock members are mocks themselves, everything possible on
    mocks is also possible on their members. And everything possible on their
    members is also possible their members members, and so on...

    Note that the following member names are reserved and cannot be used as mock
    member names : verify, on.

        To use it, first instanciate a mock to verify :
            >>> mock = Mock('theMock')

        If we ask to verify whether or not a 2nd call was invoked from the mock,
        an assertion error will be raised with a debugging-friendly message
        indicating that no call has been invoked from it up to now :
            >>> from mocki.expectations import once
            >>> from mocki.matchers import thatCall

            >>> mock.verify(thatCall('2ndCall')).invoked(once())
            Traceback (most recent call last):
            ...
            AssertionError: No call invoked from theMock up to now.

        Now, invoke some calls from the mock :
            >>> mock('1stCall')
            >>> mock('2ndCall')
            >>> mock('1stCall')

        If we ask again to verify whether or not the 2nd call was invoked, no
        more assertion error will be raised, which means that the 2nd call was
        invoked as expected :
            >>> mock.verify(thatCall('2ndCall')).invoked(once())

        Of course, if we ask the contrary, an assertion error will be raised :
            >>> from mocki.expectations import never

            >>> mock.verify(thatCall('2ndCall')).invoked(never())

            AssertionError: Found one matching call invoked from theMock up to now :
               1  theMock('1stCall')
              [2] theMock('2ndCall')
               3  theMock('1stCall')

        What is interesting here is the debugging-friendly message attached to
        the assertion error. It clearly shows us which calls were invoked from
        the mock up to now, and among them, which ones are matching with the
        verification statement. Here are some other examples :
            >>> mock.verify(thatCall('1stCall')).invoked(once())
            Traceback (most recent call last):
            ...
            AssertionError: Found 2 matching calls invoked from theMock up to now :
              [1] theMock('1stCall')
               2  theMock('2ndCall')
              [3] theMock('1stCall')

            >>> mock.verify(thatCall('3rdCall')).invoked(once())
            Traceback (most recent call last):
            ...
            AssertionError: Found no matching call invoked from theMock up to now :

               2  theMock('2ndCall')
               3  theMock('1stCall')

        Sometimes, it can be very useful to verify that some calls were invoked
        in a particular order. This is done with in order verifications.

        An important thing to known about in order verifications is that we can
        only make these verifications on mocks that share at least one parent.
        Actually, this is not a huge problem, since we can safely instanciate
        mocks from other mocks :
            >>> mock = Mock('theMock')

            >>> method, otherMethod, anotherMethod = mock.method, mock.otherMethod, mock.anotherMethod

        If we ask to verify whether or not a 2nd call was invoked from one of
        these mocks, an assertion error will be raised with a debugging-friendly
        message indicating that no call has been invoked from it up to now :
            >>> otherMethod.verify(thatCall('2ndCall')).invokedInOrder()
            Traceback (most recent call last):
            ...
            AssertionError: No call invoked from theMock.otherMethod up to now.

        Now, invoke some calls from these mocks :
            >>> method('1stCall')
            >>> otherMethod('2ndCall')
            >>> method('1stCall')

        If we ask again to verify whether or not the 2nd call was invoked, no
        more assertion error will be raised, which means that the 2nd call was
        invoked as expected :
            >>> otherMethod.verify(thatCall('2ndCall')).invokedInOrder()

        But, if we now make this verification twice, an assertion error will be
        raised again, since no other 2nd call was invoked :
            >>> otherMethod.verify(thatCall('2ndCall')).invokedInOrder()
            Traceback (most recent call last):
            ...
            AssertionError: Found one matching call invoked from theMock.otherMethod up to now, but not in order :
               1  theMock.method('1stCall')
            X [2] theMock.otherMethod('2ndCall')
               3  theMock.method('1stCall')

        What is interesting here is the debugging-friendly message attached to
        the assertion error. It clearly shows us which calls were invoked from
        the mock up to now, and among them, which ones were already verified and
        which ones are matching with the verification statement. Here are some
        other examples :
            >>> method.verify(thatCall('1stCall')).invokedInOrder()

            >>> method.verify(thatCall('1stCall')).invokedInOrder()
            Traceback (most recent call last):

            AssertionError: Found 2 matching calls invoked from theMock.method up to now, but not in order :

            X [3] theMock.method('1stCall')

    def on(self, matcher):
        """Stubs this mock on invocation to the given matching calls.

        To use it, first instanciate a mock, then stub it as desired, e.g. to
        return a given value on invocation to the given matching calls :
            >>> from mocki.matchers import anyCall
            >>> from mocki.stubs import returnValue

            >>> mock = Mock('theMock')

            >>> mock.on(anyCall()).then(returnValue('value'))

        Now, any matching invocation will return this given value :
            >>> mock('1stCall')
            'value'

            >>> mock('2ndCall')
            'value'

        Sometimes, it can be very useful to override a global stub with a more
        specific one. This is simply done by defining a new specific stub over
        the already existing global one. E.g., here is how to define a new
        specific stub for the 2nd call :
            >>> from mocki.matchers import thatCall

            >>> mock.on(thatCall('2ndCall')).then(returnValue('otherValue'))
