ISM Algorithm implementation

Implements the actual algorithm that transforms a graph (usually
computed by the DGM) into a sequence for execution.

The result is a tuple (ise_model, xml) where xml is the XML that
has been generated for the creation of the ise_model.

Graph should be a dag. Its nodes should have the following attributes:
- rule.name -> rule.action: the action to execute.

    This algorithm is correct: it ensure that dependencies will get
    executed first, efficient, most independent instructions will get
    executed in parallel but *not* optimal!

    However this algorithm have one major problems: it layers set of
    independent instructions one after the other making artificial dependencies
    between all instructions of layer n-1 to layer n. Therefore, if a single
    action returns an error at layer n, all instructions at layer n-1 will not
    be executed. This is the major problem.

    As a side effect, each action at layer n-1 will have s(n)
    dependencies on each action at layer n (action set at layer n is of
    size s(n)). Therefore the number of edges in the final graph is in
    Sum(s(i-1)*s(i)) for all i in [1, n] where n is the last action set
    with no dependencies.

    For clusters with thousands of nodes, this can lead to a very huge
    number of edges (count several gigabytes of memory for their internal
    representations)!

    E.g: a->b, a->c, d->b, it returns seq(par(b,c),par(a,d)). And therefore
    d will have to wait the end of both b and c while only b is
