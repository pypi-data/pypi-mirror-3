Installing
==========

Binary distributions
--------------------

Stand-alone, easy-to-install binary distributions for various
architectures are available to :ref:`download <download>`.

Source installation
-------------------

If you have Python you can install Wheelwright into your local site-packages.

Prerequisites
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Wheelwright depends on the following Python packages.

* `NumPy <http://numpy.scipy.org/>`_
* `Matplotlib <http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/>`_
* `rst2pdf <http://code.google.com/p/rst2pdf/>`_
* `PyQt4 <http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/>`_

Of these, NumPy and PyQt4 are probably the most difficult. Help on
installing NumPy and Matplotlib for different operating systems is in
the `Matplotlib installation guide
<http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/users/installing.html>`_. Binary
packages for PyQt4 are available from `Riverbank
<http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/download>`_.

However you manage it, once you have NumPy and PyQt4 working::

    easy_install wheelwright

should do the rest. This will find Wheelwright and the remaining
dependencies from the `Python Package Index
<http://pypi.python.org/pypi/wheelwright/>`_.

Use the ``wheelwright`` command to start the application.

Development repository
----------------------

The latest `development source
<https://bitbucket.org/biciworks/wheelwright/>`_ is available in a
Mercurial repository::

    hg clone https://bitbucket.org/biciworks/wheelwright
