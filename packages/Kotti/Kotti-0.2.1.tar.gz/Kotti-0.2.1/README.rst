Kotti is a user-friendly, light-weight and extensible `web content
management system`_.  It is licensed under a `BSD-like license
<http://repoze.org/license.html>`_

Features
========

- **User-friendly**: a simple edit interface hides advanced
  functionality from less experienced users

- **WYSIWYG editor**: includes a rich text editor that lets you edit
  content like in office applications

- **Security**: advanced user, groups and user roles management; uses
  `access control lists`_ (ACL) to control access to different parts
  of the site

- **Templating**: extend Kotti with your own look & feel with very
  little programming required

- **Customizable**: Many aspects of Kotti are configured through a
  simple INI file

- **Add-ons**: a plug-in system allows third party software to greatly
  extend Kotti

- **Pluggable authentication**: allows authentication of users through
  LDAP or other existing user databases

- **Open**: built on top of well-documented, open source components,
  such as Python_, Pyramid_ and SQLAlchemy_

- **Tested**: an automated test coverage of 100% guarantees Kotti's
  stability
