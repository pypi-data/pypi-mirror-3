You can make things ''bold'' or //italic// or '/both'/ but /'not this one'/.

More formatting, __ underline __
superscripting, x^^2^^
subscripting, log,,2,,7
'/_ bold italic underline '/_
Also possible to, have '_ underlined bold '_ and /_italic underline/_
Character formatting extends across line breaks: **bold,
this is still bold**.
This line deliberately ''does not end in double
single-quotes.
Not bold. Character formatting does not cross paragraph boundaries.
This line is single line \\ but uses line break markup to split the line.

Empty markups are '''' //// are ignored.

And, complex markups like '' hello // world // \\ is __treated__ like this ''

An example for indentation, \\ 
{{ Span( 'First level', style={ 'margin-left' : '2em'} ) }} \\ 
{{ Span( 'Second level', style={ 'margin-left' : '4em'} ) }} \\

Here is a problem that needs to be explored, [<FIXME>]

As for what will raise errors, the GAE Python runtime docs make the oh-
so-helpful statement that "the os module is available, but with
unsupported features disabled," without mentioning exact function

is that while some will raise ImportError/AttributeError (e.g.
os.mkdir), others will import fine but not work (tempfile.mkstemp).

== Links ==

You can use [[internal links]] or [[https://www.wikicreole.org|external links]],
give the link a [[internal links|different]] name.

Here's another sentence: This wisdom is taken from [[Ward Cunningham's]]
[[http://www.c2.com/doc/wikisym/WikiSym2006.pdf|Presentation at the Wikisym 06]].

Here's a external link without a description: // https://www.wikicreole.org

Be careful that italic links are rendered properly:  //[[http://my.book.example/|My Book Title]]// 

Free links without braces should be rendered as well, like http://www.wikicreole.org/ and http://www.wikicreole.org/users/\example. 

Creole1.0 specifies that http://bar and ftp://bar should not render italic,
something like foo://bar// should render as italic.

# }

The Joseph Priestley House was the American home of 18th-century British
theologian, dissenting clergyman, natural philosopher, educator, and
political theorist Joseph Priestley from 1798 until his death in 1804.
Located in Northumberland, Pennsylvania, the house, which was designed by
Priestley's wife Mary, is Georgian with Federalist accents. The
''Pennsylvania Historical'' and ''Museum Commission'' has operated it as a museum
dedicated to Joseph Priestley since 1970, but may close it by July 2009
due to low visitation and budget cuts. 
* Fleeing religious persecution and political turmoil in Britain, the Priestleys emigrated to the United States in 1794 seeking a peaceful life.
* Hoping to avoid the political troubles that had plagued them in Britain and the problems of urban life they saw in the United States, the Priestleys built a house in rural Pennsylvania; nevertheless, political disputes and family troubles dogged Priestley during the last ten years of his life.
*In the 1960s, the house was carefully restored by the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission and designated a National Historic Landmark.
* A second renovation was undertaken in the 1990s to return the home to the way it looked during Priestley's time.

=== Tables ===

Tables are done like this:

|= header col1 |=|= header col2 |=|=
|= col1   ||{y} col2      | ''{g}col3'' ||
| you          | can                       $|| hello $|
| you                        ||              | hello $|
| you                        |              | hello $|
| also                       || align\\ it. | col4   |
| you          | fix         |   it         | hello $|
 also                       || align\\ it. | col4   |

=== Big Tables ===

And big tables are done, like this :

||{{ g; /5,solid,g;}
||-{W;}
|| {y;} Fruits 
|| Icecreams
||-
||  Orange
|| {G;} Apple
||-{font-weight : bold; m;}
|| //{m;} Bread //
|| Pie
||-
|| Butter
|| Ice cream 
||}

h4. Multi-lined big tables
||{
||-
|| A ''Char'' value represents a Unicode character. 6 comments
|| A ''Bool'' {{ YearsBefore("%s before", 1999) }}, value represents a value
   in Boolean logic. The possible values of type Bool are //{b}True// and
   //{b}False//. 2 comments
|| The ``{B}Int`` type is used for signed, fixed-width integer values. The exact range
   Of values representable as Int depends on the system's longest "native"
   Integer: on a 32-bit machine, an Int is usually 32 bits wide, while on a
   64-bit machine, it is usually 64 bits wide. The Haskell standard only
   Guarantees that an Int is wider than 28 bits. (There exist numeric types that
   Are exactly 8, 16, and so on bits wide, in signed and unsigned
   Flavours; we'll get to those later.) 6 comments
|| An Integer value is a signed integer of unbounded size. Integers are not used
   as often as Ints, because they are more expensive both in performance and
   space consumption. On the other hand, Integer computations do not silently
   overflow, so they give more reliably correct answers. 9 comments
|| Values of type Double are used for floating point numbers. A Double value is
   typically 64 bits wide, and uses the system's native floating point
   representation. (A narrower type, Float, also exists, but its use is
   discouraged; Haskell compiler writers concentrate more on making
   Double efficient, so Float is much slower.) 2 comments

You can format an address by simply forcing linebreaks:

Fax: +45\\ 
Mobile: abc

| //italic text//             | ''  bold text ''          |
