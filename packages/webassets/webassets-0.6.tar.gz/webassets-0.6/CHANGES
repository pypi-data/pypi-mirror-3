0.6 (2011-10-03)
    - The Django 1.3 staticfiles contrib app is now supported.
    - Bundles may now contain URLs (as supported by urllib2).
    - Support for recursive globbing using the python-glob2 package.
    - Support for Javascript templates via a new "jst" filter
      (Lucas Hrabovsky).
    - "watch" command no longer crashes if a build fails.
    - Added a "check" command (Ross McFarland).
    - Bundles now support dependencies - files that are observed
      for the purposes of automatic rebuilding, but are not part
      of the build as far as webassets is concerned (for example,
      Sass include files).
    - Improved Sass filter:
        - No longer include debug info while in production.
        - Use the webassets cache if possible.
        - Allow to be used as an output filter.
    - Java-based filters: Expose stdout messages.
    - Added new rJSmin filter, which ships with the module.
      Deprecated the shipped jsmin module. The jsmin filter will
      require an external dependency in the future.
    - Added UglifyJS filter.
    - Fixed the gzip filter.
    - Made the Compass filter more reliable.
    - Allow container bundles to pass filters to children.
    - The cache is now enabled in production mode as well (by
      default).
