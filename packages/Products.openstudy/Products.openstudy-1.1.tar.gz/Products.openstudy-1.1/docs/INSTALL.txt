Products.openstudy Installation
-------------------------------

Products.openstudy is designed to be installed both in the latest eduCommons 
versions and also in a default Plone site. For eduCommons 3.2.1 instances, follow
the directions below. eduCommons 4.x and above already include this product.

If you are installing this product in a live production site be sure to **back up**
your entire site directory (/opt/eduCommons-3.2.1 if you are using educommons)

To Install using zc.buildout and plone.recpie.zope2instance use the following:

* Add ``Products.openstudy`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.:

    [buildout]
    ...
    eggs =
        ...
        Products.openstudy

       
* If you are installing in eduCommons 3.2.1 or a Plone 3.x version you must 
  also manually include the simplejson library. For eduCommons 4.x and 
  Plone 4.x installs Products.openstudy uses the default json library 
  provided in Python 2.6:

    [buildout]
    ...
    eggs =
        ...
        simplejson
        Products.openstudy
     

* If you are installing Products.openstudy in eduCommons 3.2.1, Re-run the buildout 
  as follows:

    $ ./bin/buildout -N -c deployment.cfg


* Otherwise Re-run buildout, e.g. with:

    $ ./bin/buildout
        

Once you have succesfully included Products.openstudy in your buildout process, 
you can then install it using the Quickinstaller from the Plone control panel.

Go to the "Site Setup" link in the top right corner. Click on Add-on Products.
Find the Products.openstudy and click on the checkbox. Then click on the install
button. 

Once installed, you should see a new studygroups tab on folderish objects. 
You can enable a study group portlet in the right column for all objects
contained within the folder by using the form provided from clicking on the tab.

For eduCommons installs, although it is possible to install a study group in 
any folderish object, it is highly recommended to only use Studygroups with
course objects.
