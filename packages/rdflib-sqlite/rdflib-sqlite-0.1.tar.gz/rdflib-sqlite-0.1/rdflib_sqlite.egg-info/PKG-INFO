Description: 
            SQLite store formula-aware implementation.  It stores its triples in the following partitions:
        
            * Asserted non rdf:type statements
            - Asserted rdf:type statements (in a table which models Class membership).
              The motivation for this partition is primarily improved query speed and
              scalability as most graphs will always have more rdf:type statements than
              others.
            - All Quoted statements
        
            In addition it persists namespace mappings in a separate table
