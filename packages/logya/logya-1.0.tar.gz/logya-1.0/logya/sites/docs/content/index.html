<p>Logya is a static Web site generator written in Python designed to be easy to use and flexible.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>Logya is an open source Python application that can be <a href="https://github.com/yaph/logya/downloads">downloaded from</a> and <a href="https://github.com/yaph/logya">forked on Github</a>.</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<h3>Create a starter site:</h3>
<pre>logya create mysite</pre>
<p>This command will create a new sub directory in your current working directory called mysite, that includes the resources for a logya starter site.</p>

<h3>Change to the starter site directory:</h3>
<pre>cd mysite</pre>

<h3>Generate files to deploy:</h3>
<pre>logya generate</pre>
<p>This command generates HTML files from the documents found in the content directory, indexes for Web site directories, and copies static resources to the newly created deploy directory.</p>

<h3>Serve site from deploy directory:</h3>
<pre>logya serve</pre>
<p>Run this command in the root directory of your mysite project and it will serve the static files from the deploy directory. When you edit files in your projects source directory and reload them in the browser they will be updated, so this can be used for live editing your site and see changes immediately.</p>

<h3>Get help on logya command:</h3>
<pre>logya -h</pre>
<p>Show the help output of the logya command with information on sub commands and options, for help on a sub command call it with the -h option, e.g. <code>logya create -h</code>.</p>

<h2>Document Structure</h2>
<p>Documents are basically html files containing the content of a page with header information to specify title, url, description, scripts and style sheets to include and self defined variables that can be accessed in templates.</p>

<h2>Development Tips</h2>
<p>The following tips are intended for people developing logya application code.</p>
<h3>Create a command that points to the development source:</h3>
<pre>ln -s $HOME/code/logya/logya/main.py $HOME/bin/logyadev</pre>
<p>This creates a symbolic link in your home bin directory to access logya commands from your development source, assuming it resides in the first directory specified above. To not override the logya command from your installation the command is called logyadev.</p>
