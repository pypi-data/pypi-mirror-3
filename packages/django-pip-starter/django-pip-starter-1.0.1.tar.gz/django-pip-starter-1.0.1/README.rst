History
=======

Idea for this project came from Mantas Zimickas (sirex, https://bitbucket.org/sirex/django-starter/overview).
This was based on zc.buildout solution. After some time using django-starter we had problems deploying it
and Petras Zdanaviƒçius (petraszd) made a fork of django-starter that used only pip. This was simple and elegant solution
that Marius Grigaitis (marltu) expanded and packaged it into this project.
