Projects are a way to group related tasks.

== Setting Projects ==

Right-click on one of the default projects in the Task List Browser.  This pops up a context menu with a submenu for Projects.  Navigate to this menu and select one of the projects from the list.

You'll see the task you selected is now listed as part of that project.  Repeat this for other tasks until all are assigned to different projects.

When you left-click on the 'Project' column header, the tasks will be sorted according to your project assignments.

You can specify the list of projects to be shown in this menu in your ~/.taskhelmrc.

== Identifying Subprojects ==

A common convention in TaskWarrior is to name subprojects like this:  "project.subproject".

Currently taskhelm does nothing special with project names in this form, but in the future it may provide a tree view for projects following this naming convention.
