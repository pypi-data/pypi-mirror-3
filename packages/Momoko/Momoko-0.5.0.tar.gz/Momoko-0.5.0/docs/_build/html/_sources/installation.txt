Installation
============

Momoko supports Python 2 and 3 (tested with 2.7 and 3.2). PyPy is not
supported, because there is no usable Psycopg2 module for PyPy.

Momoko only depends on two modules. Tornado_ and and Psycopg2_ (2.2.0 or higher).
Psycopg2 must have support for asynchronous connections.

Momoko can be installed with *easy_install* or pip_::

	pip install momoko

The latest sources can be cloned from the `Github repository`_ and
installed with::

   python setup.py install
