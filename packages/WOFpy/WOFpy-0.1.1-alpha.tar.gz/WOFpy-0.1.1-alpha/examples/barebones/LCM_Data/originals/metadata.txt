STUDY DESCRIPTION
The Long-Term Water Quality and Biological Monitoring Project for Lake Champlain has been in operation since 1992. The project is conducted by the Vermont Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) and the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation with funding provided by the Lake Champlain Basin Program and the two states. The monitoring network includes 15 lake stations representing major lake segments with distinct physical and water quality characteristics.

NOTES
15 sampling locations are used.  Latitude and longitude coordinates for sampling locations are recorded.  Coordinates use the WGS84 datum.
