        Async Integration
        -----------------
        
        It it highly recommended to install and configure plone.app.async
        in combination with this package. Doing so will manage all pdf
        conversions processes asynchronously so the user isn't delayed
        so much when saving files.
        
        
        Settings
        --------
        
        The product can be configured via a control panel item
        `Document Viewer Settings`.
        
        Some interesting configuration options:
        
        Storage Type
            If you want to be able to serve you files via amazon cloud, 
            this will allow you to store the data in flat files that
            can be synced to another server.
        Storage Location
            Where are the server to store the files.
        OCR
            Use tesseract to scan the document for text. This process ca be
            slow so if your pdfs do not need to be OCR'd, you may disable.
        Auto Select Layout
            For pdf files added to the site, automatically select the
            document viewer display.
        Auto Convert
            When pdf files are added and modified, automatically convert.
        
        
        File storage integration
        ------------------------
        
        If you choose to use basic file storage instead of zodb blob storage,
        there are a few things you'll want to keep in mind.
        
        1) Use nginx to then serve the file system files. This might require
           you install a local nginx just for serving file storage on the
           plone server. You can get creative with how your file storage
           is used though.
        
        2) Since in plone's operation, it can be interrupted and the deletion
           of a file on the OS system system can not be done within a transaction,
           no files are ever deleted. However, there is an action you can
           put in a cron task to clean up your file storage directory. Just call the
           url `http://zeoinstace/plone/@@dvcleanup-filestorage`.
        
        
        TODO
        ----
        
         - reject converting pdf if too large and no async support provided?
            - or let people hang themselves?
