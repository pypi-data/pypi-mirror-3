Description: walkdir is a simple set of iterator tools intended to make it
        easy to manipulate and filter the output of os.walk() in a way
        that is also easily applicable to any source iterator that
        produces data in the same format.
        
        It offers tools such as:
        
          - glob-style filtering for file and directory names
          - depth limiting for directory recursion
          - flattening of output into simple sequences of path names
          - detection of symlink loops when following symlinks
