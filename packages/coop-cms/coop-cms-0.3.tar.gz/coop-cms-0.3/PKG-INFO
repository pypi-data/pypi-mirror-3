        Yet another CMS ?
        ------------------------------------
        
        #. Coop-cms is built around Articles. It defines a basic abstract model so you can define your own model.
        #. It has a website tree in a nice admin widget, to let you order Articles and *any other standard django model* you've defined in your project.
        #. Based on the tree, you get templatetags for menu navigation, siblings links, breadcrumb, etc
        
        Coop-cms has some sister apps to make it more usable:
        
        * `coop_bar <https://github.com/quinode/coop-bar/>`_, an extensible toolbar (same concept : any app you create can add links in the toolbar)
        * `djaloha <https://github.com/quinode/djaloha/>`_, a great in-site editor based on `Aloha Editor <http://aloha-editor.org/>`_

        Quick start
        ------------------------------------
        
        Install it with ``pip install coop-cms``
        
        In settings.py, add 'coop_cms' (with an underscore) to the INSTALLED_APPS 
        Under Django 1.3, the static folder should be found automatically, as the templates folder
        At *the very end* of your urls.py file, add ``(r'^', include('coop_cms.urls'))`` to your urlpatterns, because coop-cms will handle any page slug, except the ones you will have defined before.
        
        The ``apps```folder contains two example projects of how coop-cms can be used.
