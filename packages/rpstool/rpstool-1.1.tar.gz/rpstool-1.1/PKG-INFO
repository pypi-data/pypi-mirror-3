Description: A simple requests per second (rps) counter.
        
        Intended for use in combination with POSIX tail (or similar) program.
        Example: tail -f /var/log/access-log1 /var/log/access-log2 | rpstool
        Of course, its usage is reasonable for highly loaded services only ;-)
