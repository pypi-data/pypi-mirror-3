Welcome to CodeChat, a conversational coding system.

Getting started
===============
To get up and running, you'll need to do some software installs. In addition to
the code in this package and the dependencies listed at http://pypi.python.org/pypi/CodeChat, you may optionally install:

* `MiKTeX <http://miktex.org>'_ to generate math formulas viewable in this
  application. On the first run, you'll be prompted to install a few additional
  MiKTeX packages.
* `GraphViz <http://www.graphviz.org/>'_ to create graphs.

Next, choose some source code to document. Currently, only C/C++, Python, and reST are supported.
