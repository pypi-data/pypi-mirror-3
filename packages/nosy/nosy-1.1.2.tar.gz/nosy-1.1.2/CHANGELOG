Changelog
---------

v1.1.2 15-Sep-2011
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Fix packaging errors. CHANGELOG was missing from MANIFEST.in, and
  setup.py failed under Python 2.5 due to the use of context managers.


v1.1.1 13-Sep-2011
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Refactored checksum calculations to flatten nested loops and improve
  testability.

* Added test suite.

* Fixed a bug that caused ``nose`` not to run when
  ``exclude_patterns`` was empty. Thanks to Greg Haskins for the
  patch, and an anonymous issue reporter on Bitbucket.

* Fixed a bug that caused files in the ``base_path`` not to be
  monitored. Thanks to Greg Haskins for the patch.


v1.1 21-Mar-2011
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Configuration file now defaults to ``setup.cfg``.

* New configuration options to make it easier to use ``nosy`` in
  projects with deep directory structures. The checksum calculator now
  uses ``os.walk()`` starting from ``base_path``, including files
  given by a list of ``glob_patterns``, excluding those given by a
  list of ``exclude_patterns``. Files given by the ``extra_paths``
  list are also glob-ed in to handle anything that the first 3 options
  don't easily catch. Thanks to Jussi Rasinm√§ki for the suggestion.

* The ``paths`` configuration option is retained for backward
  compatibility only.

* Changed from ``setuptools`` to ``distribute`` for packaging.

* Source code and issue tracker now on bitbucket.org: https://bitbucket.org/douglatornell/nosy

* Released under New BSD License.

* Released on PyPI: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/nosy


v1.0 13-Jun-2008
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Original release.
