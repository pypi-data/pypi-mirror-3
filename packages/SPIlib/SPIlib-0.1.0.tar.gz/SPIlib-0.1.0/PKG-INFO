Description: ==========
        SPIlib
        ==========
        
        SPIlib is a thin wrapper to interact with SPI devices using the Linux
        "SPIdev" interface [#Spidev]_
        
        See the accelerometer example in the examples directory.
        
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Usage is quite simple.
        First you have to build a Transfer::
        
            from spi import spi_transfer, SPIDev
            transfer, buf, _ = spi_transfer(chr(0x1b), readlen=0)
        
        This prepares a transfer which sends one byte (first parameter) and reads none
        (second parameter).
        It returns binary data which is then passed to SPIDev (the transfer buffer, the
        write buffer and the read buffer, the last ignored in the example).
        It is possible to change the write and read buffer beetween transfers (without
        altering their lenght of course!).
        
        To actually do the transfer use do_transfer::
        
            myspidev = SPIDev('/dev/spidev0.0')
            myspidev.do_transfers([transfer])
        
        do_transfers takes a list of transfers to do in a single "session", maintaining
        the device selected.
        For examples by using three transfers you can write one byte, read and write
        one at the same time.
        Note that it is not possible to interact with data during a single "session"
        because of a limit of the Linux SPIDev interface (and thus of this interface)
