Description: repoze.workflow
        ===============
        
        repoze.workflow is a state machine and associated configuration system
        useful for workflow-like applications.  Refer to docs/index.rst or
        `the online docs <http://docs.repoze.org/workflow>`_ for further
        information.
        
        
        repoze.workflow Changelog
        =========================
        
        0.6.1 (2012-03-24)
        ------------------
        
        - Repair packaging error (incomplete tarball in 0.6).
        
        
        0.6 (2012-03-24)
        ----------------
        
        - When multiple transitions exist between two states, try each transition
          until one succeeds, instead of aborting if the first fails.
        
        - Bumped ``zope.configuration`` dependency to require >= 3.8.0:  the internal
          format of configuration actions changed to dictionaries, rather than tuples,
          and our tests make assertions which rely on the format.
        
        - ``repoze.sphinx.autointerface`` and ``zope.testing`` are only required for
          testing and will no longer be downloaded for ``python setup.py install``;
          use ``python setup.py dev`` to get them installed (along with ``nose`` and
          ``coverage``).
        
        - 100% test coverage
        
        0.5 (2009-08-27)
        ----------------
        
        - Major overhaul.  Older "statemachine" workflows still work, but are
          deprecated.  Workflow declarations may now be performed via ZCML.
          Documentation overhauled to reflect this fact.
        
        0.4 (2009-06-24)
        ----------------
        
        - 100% test coverage.
        
        - Allow ``add`` method to accept arbitrary keyword arguments.  These
          keyword arguments are now passed as ``**kw`` to transition functions
          as well as ``before_transition`` and ``after_transition``.  This
          allows arbitrary metadata (such as security and UI information) to
          be associated with a transition.
        
        - The ``transitions`` method now returns all transitions, including
          "catch-all" transitions (transitions with a transition_id of None).
        
        - Add ``transition_info`` method to state machine, which
        
        0.3 (2009-04-10)
        ----------------
        
        - Removed mutable default arguments, to avoid polluting one state machine's
          states when adding to another.
        
        0.2 (2009-02-20)
        ----------------
        
        - Initial release. Updated README.txt and removed remnants from repoze
          package template.
