Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        Provides **local** configuration for **collective.dancing**, thus
        allowing for news letter channels to be context-based.
        
        This is done by registering local utilities for channel lookup. UI-wise
        this is done by having a additional boolean field in the **settings** schemata
        injected by **archetypes.schemaextender**.
