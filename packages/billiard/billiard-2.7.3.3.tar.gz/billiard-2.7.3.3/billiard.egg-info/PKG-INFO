        About
        -----
        
        `billiard` is a fork of the Python 2.7 `multiprocessing <http://docs.python.org/library/multiprocessing.html>`_
        package. The multiprocessing package itself is a renamed and updated version of
        R Oudkerk's `pyprocessing <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/processing/>`_ package.
        This standalone variant is intended to be compatible with Python 2.4 and 2.5,
        and will draw it's fixes/improvements from python-trunk.
        
        - This package would not be possible if not for the contributions of not only
          the current maintainers but all of the contributors to the original pyprocessing
          package listed `here <http://pyprocessing.berlios.de/doc/THANKS.html>`_
        
        - Also it is a fork of the multiprocessin backport package by Christian Heims.
        
        - It includes the no-execv patch contributed by sbt.
        
        - And the Pool improvements previously located in `Celery`_.

        ===========
        Changes
        ===========
        
        2.7.3.3 - 2012-04-23
        
        - PyPy now falls back to using its internal _multiprocessing module,
          so everything works except for forking_enable(False) (which
          silently degrades).
        
        - Fixed Python 2.5 compat issues.
        
        - Uses more with statements
        
        - Merged some of the changes from the Python 3 branch.
        
        2.7.3.2 - 2012-04-20
        --------------------
        
        - Now installs on PyPy/Jython (but does not work).
        
        2.7.3.1 - 2012-04-20
        --------------------
        
        - Python 2.5 support added.
        
        2.7.3.0 - 2012-04-20
        --------------------
        
        - Updated from Python 2.7.3
        
        - Python 2.4 support removed, now only supports 2.5, 2.6 and 2.7.
          (may consider py3k support at some point).
        
        - Pool improvments from Celery.
        
        - no-execv patch added (http://bugs.python.org/issue8713)
