        Centipede
        =========
        Centipede is a collection of WSGI middleware with a simple decorator based router. It's strength is that it models the technology in use and tries not to confuse developers with complex patterns and tricks. It is what I use to stack my rest services these days.
        
        Installation
        ============
        :
            $ pip install centipede
        
        Defining handlers
        =================
        :
            from centipede import expose, app
        
            @expose('^/$','GET', content_type='text/plain')
            def index(request, response):
                """ Return the index template
                """
                return 'IgglePigglePartyPants.'
         
            import json
         
            @expose('^/twitter$','GET', content_type='application/json')
            def twitter(request, response):
                """ Return your twitter status
                """
                return json.dumps({
                    'status' : 'My awesome and insightful twitter status. #blah'
                })
            
            application = app()
        
        
        Templates
        =========
        I would recommend keeping your html templates static on the client side and use a javascript template library. But if you really need some server side templating, have a look at mako.
        
        	
        Deployment
        ==========
        For deployment it is not a good idea to use the wsgiref simple_server that the run script uses. A much better idea is to run your centipede application behind a WSGI server. There is a bunch. I recommend running uwsgi behind nginx if you are deploying on your own server. Or have a look at heroku.
        
        Heroku
        ======
        Deploying centipede applications on heroku is dead simple. Just add this to your Procfile.
        :
            web: uwsgi -w uwsgi_app -H . --http-socket 0.0.0.0:$PORT
        
        uwsgi
        =====
        For deployment using uwsgi, we've supplied a uwsgi_app.py module and a uwsgi_init script. Modify to fit your needs ;-).
        
        
        enjoy.
