Changes
-------

The following packages have been updated since Dexterity 1.0.1:

  Dexterity 2.0.
  [davisagli]

plone.schemaeditor 1.0.2 & 1.0.3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  
* Fix test.
  [davisagli]
  
* Make FieldFactory do a deep copy of its arguments to avoid problems with
  mutable defaults getting shared between field instances.
  This fixes http://code.google.com/p/dexterity/issues/detail?id=133
  [davisagli]
  
* Remove dependency on zope.app.schema.
  [davisagli]

plone.app.z3cform 0.5.5 & 0.5.6
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Make sure group errors get styled like field errors.
  [davisagli]

* Include group and field descriptions as structure.
  [davisagli]

* Make it possible to add a custom CSS class to a form by setting its css_class attribute.
  [davisagli]

* Match plone.z3cform's template in including the form description as structure.
  [davisagli]

plone.z3cform 0.7.7
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Avoid rendering a wrapped form if a redirect has already occurred after updating it.
  [davisagli]

* Remove <a name=""/> elements from inside the CRUD table TBODY element they were
  otherwise unused (and illegal in that location of the HTML content model).
  [mj]

plone.app.relationfield 1.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Make sure the content tree widget profile is installed.
  [davisagli]

* Moved the 'related items' behavior here from plone.app.dexterity.
  [davisagli]

plone.formwidget.autocomplete 1.2.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Use full widget name in ++widget++ path, don't try and remove form prefix
  (which will not behave correctly if widget is part of a subform).
  [lentinj]

plone.formwidget.contenttree 1.0.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Fix regression that broke the browsing with JQuery < 1.4.
  [davisagli]

collective.z3cform.datetimewidget 1.0.5
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Change more $ to jQuery.
  [danjacka]

* Fix month selection issue with the date input widget.  Previously, due
  to the leading zero, months < 10 weren't being selected when picking a
  date on the calendar widget.
  [davidjb]

* Fix date offset issue for default dates on the jQuery date input widget.
  Providing the default value as a JavaScript Date(yyyy, mm, dd) required
  months to be in the range of 0 to 11 but outputting as Date("yyyy/mm/dd")
  works as expected.
  [davidjb]

* Fix issue with jQuery date input widget not being displayed when
  an incomplete date was entered.
  [davidjb]

* Avoid error fetching widget values when no year or day was entered.
  [davisagli]

* Made js for dateinput popup check for jQuery().dateinput before invoking
  it. Changed from $ to jQuery.
  [smcmahon]

* removed trailing comma in JavaScript dict (which broke Internet Explorer)
  [Brainix]
