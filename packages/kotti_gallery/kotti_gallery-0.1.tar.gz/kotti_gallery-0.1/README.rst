Setup
=====

To activate the ``kotti_gallery`` add-on in your Kotti site, you need to add an entry to the ``kotti.configurators`` setting in your Paste Deploy config.
If you don't have a ``kotti.configurators`` option, add one.
The line in your ``[app:main]`` section could then look like this::

  kotti.configurators = kotti_gallery.kotti_configure

With this, you'll be able to add galleries in your site.


Development
===========

Contributions to ``kotti_gallery`` are highly welcome.
Just clone its `Github repository`_ and submit your contributions as pull requests.

Note that all development is done on the ``develop`` branch and ``master`` is reserved for "production-ready state".
Therefore make sure to always base your work on the current state of the ``develop`` branch.

This follows the highly recommended `A successful Git branching model`_ pattern, which is implemented by the excellent `gitflow`_ git extension.

Testing
-------

``kotti_gallery`` has 100% test coverage.
Please make sure that you add tests for new features and that all tests pass before submitting pull requests.
Running the test suite is as easy as running ``py.test`` from the source directory.
