        ## django url pattern generation via inspection
        
        ## what
        use `snout` to generate routes for your django apps using inspection, so you can do more interesting things.
        
        instead of this:
        
            # breakfast/urls.py
            from django.conf.urls import patterns, url
            urlpatterns =  patterns('',
                url(r'^$','breakfast.views.index'),
                url(r'^order/$''', 'breakfast.views.order'),
                url(r'^waffles/$''', 'breakfast.views.waffles'),
                url(r'^sausage/$''', 'breakfast.views.sausage'),
                url(r'^toast/(?P<num_slices>\d+)$''', 'breakfast.views.toast'),
            )
         
        
        now you can do this:
        
            # breakfast/urls.py
            import views
            import snout
            urlpatterns = snout.make_django_patterns(views)
        
        awww yeah
        
        ## how
        
        `make_django_patterns` creates a route for all functions in the given module, except those starting with "_"
        
         underscores (_) are replaced with dashes (-) because why not?
        
         a view named "index" is given the route "^$" by default
        
         any arguments to your view (other than "requests") are assigned regular expression match groups. 
        
        
        ## why
        
        laziness
