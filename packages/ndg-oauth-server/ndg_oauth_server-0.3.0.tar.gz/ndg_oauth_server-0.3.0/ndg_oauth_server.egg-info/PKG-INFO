Description: This is an OAuth 2.0 server library and WSGI middleware filter.
        
        It supports simple string-based bearer token and a custom extension to enable 
        the use of X.509 certificates as tokens.  The latter has been added for a
        specialised use case to enable a SLCS (Short-lived Credential Service) to issue 
        delegated X.509-based credentials with OAuth.
        
        Prerequisites
        =============
        This has been developed and tested for Python 2.6 and 2.7.
        
        Installation
        ============
        Installation can be performed using easy_install or pip.  
        
        Configuration
        =============
        Examples are contained in the examples/ sub-folder:
        
        bearer_tok/:
          This configures a simple test application that uses string based tokens.
        slcs/:
          This is a more complex and specialised example that issues X.509 certificate-
          based tokens as part of a Short-lived Credential Service.  The authorisation
          server requires access to a specially configured MyProxyCA service (
          http://grid.ncsa.illinois.edu/myproxy/ca/) configured with a custom PAM to 
          allow issue of credentials. See: 
          http://ndg-security.ceda.ac.uk/browser/trunk/MashMyData/pam_credential_translation
          
        The examples should be used in conjunction with the ndg.oauth client package.
