Description: Alcohol consists of two parts: At its core, it contains a few named `Blinker
        <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/blinker/>`_ signals and a precise specification on
        how to use them. These signals define a general model for handling user logins
        using any sort of credentials and reacting upon them.
        
        In addition to that, alcohol comes some utility code that makes writing
        authorization code a lot easier, such as predefined password-hashing methods or
        complete mixins for `SQLAlchemy <http://www.sqlalchemy.org/>`_ based user
        models.
