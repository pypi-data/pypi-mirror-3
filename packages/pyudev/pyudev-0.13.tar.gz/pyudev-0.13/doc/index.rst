Welcome to pyudev's documentation!
==================================

pyudev is a Python_ binding to libudev_, the hardware management library and
service found in modern linux systems.  It is available under the same
licence as the original library, which is the `GNU LGPL 2.1`_ (see
:doc:`licencing` for details).


Installation
------------

The current release is pyudev |release|, available in the `Python Package
Index`_.  Refer to the :doc:`changes` for a list of important changes since
the last release [#changes]_.

The basic binding is implemented in pure Python atop of ctypes_.  The only
dependencies are udev_ and Python.  pyudev supports CPython_ 2.6 or newer
(including 3.x) and PyPy_ 1.5 or newer, and is tested against udev_ 151 and
newer.  Older versions of older versions of udev_ may or may not work.  If
pyudev doesn't work with your udev_ version, please report an issue (see
:ref:`contribution`).

The toolkit integration modules in :mod:`pyudev.pyqt4`, :mod:`pyudev.pyside`
and :mod:`pyudev.glib` require some libraries from the corresponding toolkit.
Refer to the documentation of these modules for a more precise description.

Installation is rather simple, just run::

   pip install pyudev


Documentation
-------------

Usage of pyudev is rather simple:

>>> from pyudev import Context
>>> context = Context()
>>> for device in context.list_devices(subsystem='input', ID_INPUT_MOUSE=True):
...     if device.sys_name.startswith('event'):
...         device.parent['NAME']
...
u'"Logitech USB-PS/2 Optical Mouse"'
u'"Broadcom Corp"'
u'"PS/2 Mouse"'

Please read the :doc:`API documentation <api/index>` for detailed
information.
