A tiny python implementation of 'Value Object' of Eric Evans DDD.
This provides ValueObject class and it's JSON encoder.
For more details of DDD, see the website(http://domaindrivendesign.org/).

Current version is development and unstable.
I have to write, and test more, means you should not use this for your production codes.
