        ===============
        
        django-sendgrid is the easiest way to send e-mail with SendGrid. It uses the SendGrid SMTP API, as recommended.
        
        Although it's rather simple to use, a example project is included to demonstrate usage.
        
        Installation

        To install with PyPi::

        Usage
        -----
        
        Add the following to your ``settings``::
