            - create and apply custom workflows
            - create custom listings

        .. topic:: Summary
        
            It’s a fact - Plone has a lot of complicated features. That doesn’t mean
            Plone is hard for everything! This is a simple tutorial that anyone can
            follow to get a simple Todo list application running inside of Plone.
            Would you want to deploy Plone for just a Todo list in real life? Probably
            not. You can however learn several simple, fast concepts that will get you
            most of the way there. Feeling like you don’t understand something
            completely or the terminology is getting to you? Sit back, relax, and finish
            the tutorial. If in the end things still aren’t clear, please give feedback
            and we’ll look at what we could do better.
