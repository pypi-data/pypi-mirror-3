Introduction
************
A python ORM which enables you to get started in less than a minute! 
Super easy to setup and super easy to use, yet super powerful! 
You would regret that you didn't discorver it earlier!



Features
********
 - quick: you could get and play with it in less than a minute. It couldn't be more straightforward.
 - easy: you don't have to write any SQL statement, including those "create table xxx ..." ones.
 - simple: the core code counts only 220 lines including comments and pydocs, bugs have nowhere to hide.
 - free: released under BSD license, you are free to use it and distribute it.
 - powerful: built upon SQLAlchemy and doesn't compromise its power.
 - flexible: you are free to write raw sql to improve performance.
 - support multiple databases: you can map your models to many databases without difficulty.
 - write less, do more: taking advantage of python metaclass reduces data modeling code dramatically.
 - long-term maintained: Continous efforts are taking to improve and maintain it.



Prerequisites 
*************
You need Python 2.6 or above. I didn't test it against Python 3+. I will do it soon.
You need SQLAlchemy 0.7+. I didn't test it against SQLAlchemy versions before 0.7. 
You need toolkit_library 0.3.1+
You could issue the following command to install the prerequisites: 
    pip install --upgrade sqlalchemy
    pip install --upgrade toolkit_library

       

How to install or upgrade ? 
***************************
just one command:  
    pip install --upgrade quick_orm    
Alternatively you could download the source code and issue command: python setup.py install



{{ examples }}
More examples
*************
More examples could be found in folder site-packages/quick_orm/examples/
And even more examples are being added   
  


Where to learn more about quick_orm?
************************************
As said above, quick_orm is built upon SQLAlchemy. Quick ORM never tried to hide SQLAlchemy's flexibility and power. 
Everything availiable in SQLAlchemy is still available in quick_orm. 
So please read the documents of SQLAlchemy, you would learn much more there than you could here.  
Read quick_orm's source code. add anything you want to it.



You wanna involve? 
******************
The source code is released under BSD lisence. And the current code line is below 220 (including comments and pydocs).
I am planning to move the project to github. I will post the link here once I've done.



Acknowledgements
****************
Quick ORM is built upon SQLAlchemy - the famous Python SQL Toolkit and Object Relational Mapper. 
All of the glory belongs to the SQLAlchemy development team and the SQLAlchemy community! 
My contribution to Quich ORM becomes trivial compared with theirs( to SQLAlchemy).
