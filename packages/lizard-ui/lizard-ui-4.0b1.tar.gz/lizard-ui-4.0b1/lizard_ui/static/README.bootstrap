Twitter bootstrap from http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/

Downloaded: twitter-bootstrap-v2.0.1 master

Added bootstrap.min.js from the generated doc zipfile as we've got problems
with the yui minimizer that django-compressor uses.

In the main .less file, I added includes for lizard-bootstrap and sitespecific.less at the end:

// Lizard-specific overrides and extras.
@import "../../lizard_ui/lizard-bootstrap.less";
@import "../../lizard_ui/sitespecific.less";
