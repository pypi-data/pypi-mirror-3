        Quickstart
        -----------
        Include "pinax-theme-foundation" in your requirements file and "pinax_theme_foundation" in your INSTALLED APPS.
        
        Make sure both template loaders and staticfiles finders includes app directories.
        
        Site name comes from Sites fixture.
        
        Your "site_base.html" should extend "theme_base.html" and should provide "footer" and "nav" blocks (the latter should just be a ul of li of a links).
        
        Your pages should have blocks "head_title" and "body" and should extend "site_base.html".
        
        The url name "home" should be defined as the homepage.
        
        
        Forms
        -----
        
        This theme ships with a basic template tag for rendering forms that match
        the markup expected by foundation
        
        To style forms, add the following to the top of your template ::
            
            {% load foundation_tags %}
        
        and include your form using the following markup: ::
            
            <form method="POST" action="">
                {% csrf_token %}
                <fieldset class="form-controls">
                    {{ form|as_foundation }}
                </fieldset>
                <fieldset class="form-actions">
                    <button type="submit" class="btn primary">Submit</button>
                </fieldset>
            </form>
         
        Todo / Issues
        --------------
        * Build additional templates for other Pinax-related apps
        * Find a proper solution to the top navigation bar. The Foundation framework does not currently contain a top navigation bar we are currently
          using the "zurBar" foun on the document site. This bar does no support drop down items
        * Add responive tags to starter templates to fully support mobile devices
