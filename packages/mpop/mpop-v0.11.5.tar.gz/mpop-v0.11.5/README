This is the Meteorological Post-Processing Package (MPoP). 

A recent build of the documentation is available at
http://mraspaud.github.com/mpop/.

Otherwise, the documentation is in the `doc` directory and can be build with
sphinx (it has to be installed) using::

   make html

or::

   make latex

from there.
