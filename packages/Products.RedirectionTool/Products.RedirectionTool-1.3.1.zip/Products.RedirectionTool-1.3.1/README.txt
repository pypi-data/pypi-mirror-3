About
-----
  The Redirection Tool allows the management of the aliases stored in
  "plone.app.redirector":http://pypi.python.org/pypi/plone.app.redirector.


Using The RedirectionTool
-------------------------
  To make a redirection to a piece of
  content...

    1. Navigate to that content.

    2. Click the Aliases tab.

    3. Enter the short name or the absolute path that should redirect to the
       content.

    4. Click Add.

  There is also a Redirection and Aliases control panel under Site Setup which
  presents all the redirections in the site in one place, allows enabling and
  disabling alias management per content type, and lets you upload redirections
  in bulk.
