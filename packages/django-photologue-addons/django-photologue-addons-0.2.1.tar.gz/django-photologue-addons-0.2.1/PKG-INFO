        This project exists mostly to provide a way to have useful tools for photologue without cluttering the core repo, and also to allow these utilities to be used with any recent version of django-photologue.
        
        Tags
        --------
        
        Currently the only thing in the project are two new tags:
        
        * get_public_photos
        * get_gallery
        
        They allow you to embed photologue photos and galleries into whatever other pages on your site you'd like them to appear on, such as a flatpage.
        
        Checkout the templatetags/photologue_extra_tags.py file for more information.
