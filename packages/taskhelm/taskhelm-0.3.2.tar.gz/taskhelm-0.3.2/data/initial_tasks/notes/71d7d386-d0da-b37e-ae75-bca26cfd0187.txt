TaskHelm is a graphical front-end for the quite powerful TaskWarrior command line task manager.  TaskWarrior has many capabilities available to you that aren't implemented in TaskHelm but can be accessed from the command line.

In the Quick-Add entry field add a task "Foobar".

Now switch to a command line console and enter the following command:

  $ task undo

TaskWarrior will print out something like the following:

The last modification was made 9/16/2011

Prior Values	Current Values                      
description	Foobar                              
entry			9/16/2011                           
status			pending                             
uuid			20418986-a796-f4d4-1b6e-b329d76320b4

The undo command is not reversible.  Are you sure you want to revert to the previous state? (y/n)

Hit the 'y' key, and the Foobar task will be removed:

Task removed.
