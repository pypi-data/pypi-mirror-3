        =====
        
        **WIMMS** stands for *Where Is My Mozilla Service ?*.
        
        This library implements a SQL backend for a database that
        lists for a list of service, (user, node, service) tuples.
        
        It's used by Mozilla's  Token Server.
        
        To see where WIMMS fits in the whole architecture, see:
