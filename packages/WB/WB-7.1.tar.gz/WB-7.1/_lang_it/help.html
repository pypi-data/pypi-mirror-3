When you select "New document" from the main menu you get the following form:
<p>
<img src=../_img/newdoc.jpg>
<p>
Where you must specify your username and password in order to be authorized to
make modifications, and you must specify the document style. Document style may be as follows:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Text+attachments</b>. Allows you to create a page with text and,
optionally, to attach documents (e.g.: PDF documents, PostScript documents, images) to it.
The title you will specify will also be used in the document index.

<li><b>One attachment only</b> will allow you to upload a single document (PDF, PostScript,
JPG, etc.) and specify the text which will appear in the index.

<li><b>One link only</b> will allow you to specify a generic URL as targetr of the specified
       index item.
</ul>
The next step will let you enter the <a href=#edit>edit menu</a>

If you selected "modify" from the main menu you get the following form:
<p>
<img src=../_img/modify.jpg>
<p>

You must specify, as above, username and password and select the document you want to modify or delete.
If you push the red button (delete) you'll be prompted for confirmation. If you push the green
butto (modify) you enter the edit menu.

<a name=edit> <h3>The Edit Menu</h3></a>

When you want to add or modify a document in a billboard, you'll use
the edit menu. Fields  in the form are explained below.
<p>
<center><img src=../_img/edit_form.jpg></center>
<p>
<ol>
<p><li> The document title. This will also be used in the billboard index.
<p><li> The author of the document.
<p><li> The date of the document: it is automatically initialized to the current
     day, for a new document, and to the previous document date when
     editing an existing one. It may be changed at will. <b>Dates must be
     written in numeric format: mm/dd/yyyy</b>.
<p><li> The expiration date of the document. If specified it must be later
     than the document date.

<p><li> If you check this checkbox the text of the document will be interpreted
     as HTML source code, otherwise it will be displayed as typed in, respecting
     new lines, ecc. Note that if you do not specify HTML format, you must explicitly put newlines into text,
     otherwise it will be displayed as a single, long line.

<p><li> Text area. Here you write the text of the document (see also: point 5).

<p><li> When you press this button, the text contained in the box
     below is scanned to find URL specifications (e.g.: 
     <tt>http://www.arcetri.inaf.it</tt>) and those specifications 
     are converted into hyperlinks.
<p>
     Note that if you press the button again at the next screen, the process
     is done again, and the result may not be what you want: so use the button
     with care.

<p><li> Attachment area: here you see files you have attached to the main 
        document. If you uncheck the checkbox after the number, the attachment 
        will be removed.

<p><li> New attachment title.  Here you can write a title for a new attachment
        you want to attach. The field is filled with a hint you can
   change at will.
<p><li> Here you must specify the full path of the file you want to
        attach (see also point 11).

<p><li> In order to find a file to be attached, when you press the "Browse"
        button you will get a file selection interaction box. When you
select a file, the full path will be written in the field N.10
<p><li> After selecting a file to attach you may press this button to
        have it attached (Note: if you have specified a file to attach, 
        any other button will also perform the attachment other than its specific function).
<p><li> When you've finished with all details you press the "Show preview" (green) 
        button to look at the resulting document, as it will be published.
<p><li> If you change your mind you press "cancel" and the new document
insertion (or the modification) will be canceled.
</ol>

<h3> Using maintenance commands</h3>

Billboard management consists essentially in removing expired documents.
If the proper configuration parametere for the given billboard is defined,
expired documents would be moved into a different directory, instead of 
being removed.
<p>
Authorized users can invoke the maintenance command 
from the <a href=#maint>maintenance interface</a>.
