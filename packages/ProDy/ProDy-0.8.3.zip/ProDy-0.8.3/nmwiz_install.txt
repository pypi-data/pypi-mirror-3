NMWiz Installation
*******************************************************************************

NMWiz is written in `TCL <http://tcl.tk/>`_. To be able to use it, 
you need to have VMD version 1.8.7 or higher installed on your computer.
NMWiz works on all platforms that VMD is available for, including Linux, 
Mac OS, and Windows.

See |vmd| for obtaining VMD.

Downloads
===============================================================================

Plug-in files come in the following compressed archives:
 
  * `ProDy-0.8.2.zip <http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/P/ProDy/ProDy-0.8.2.zip>`_
  * `ProDy-0.8.2.tar.gz <http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/P/ProDy/ProDy-0.8.2.tar.gz>`_


Installation
===============================================================================

Manual Installation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Following instructions apply to all computer architectures and operating 
systems that VMD runs on, but may require root (or administrator) access.

#. Extract tarball/zip (:file:`ProDy-0.{x}.tar.gz`) contents.

#. Copy :file:`nmwiz0.{x}` folder into VMD plug-ins directory 
   (:file:`$VMDDIR/plugins/noarch/tcl/`).

#. Insert the following line to :file:`$VMDDIR/scripts/vmd/loadplugins.tcl` 
   file in VMD directory at line number 143 (or wherever you like)::

    vmd_install_extension nmwiz nmwiz_tk "Analysis/Normal Mode Wizard"


If you are not sure where VMD directory is located, run :program:`vmd`, and 
type the following command line in the VMD console::

    global env; puts $env(VMDDIR)

Once you perform these steps, NMWiz GUI will show up in 
:menuselection:`Extensions --> Analysis` menu of VMD main window. 
It is also possible to make it appear in another :menuselection:`Extensions` 
submenu by replacing *Analysis* in step 3 with another submenu name.

Using Installer Script
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alternatively, you can use :file:`install_nmwiz.py` script. This script
will locate VMD plug-ins directory, copy the files, remove older versions if 
found, and update the :file:`loadplugins.tcl` file. Again, this script
also requires write access to the VMD folders. On Linux, following command
should work:: 
 
  $ sudo python install_nmwiz.py
  
This installer script works in Linux and Windows. Mac OS users, please
follow the manual installation instructions.
  
Updates
===============================================================================

To install a newer version, you will need to delete the existing plug-in 
directory and copy the new release to the same location.
