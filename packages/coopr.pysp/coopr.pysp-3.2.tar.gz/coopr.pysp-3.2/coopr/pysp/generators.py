# the intent of this file is to provide a collection of generator (iterables) functions, which
# embody certain highly repeated patterns of nested iteration in PySP. these generators should
# allow for simplification of the code base, and should generally improve maintainability.

# iterates over each stage (minus possibly the last, depending on the keyword arguments),
# each tree node in each stage, each variable in each tree node, and each component of 
# each variable. returns a six-tuple, including:
# - the stage
# - the tree node
# - the variable (Var) object associated with the stage (this is *not* an instance variable).
# - the index of the variable.
# - a boolean indicating whether the variable/index is fixed in all scenario instance.
#   NOTE: We don't actually check for agreement, but we should.
# - a boolean indicating whether the variable/index is stale in all scenario instances.
