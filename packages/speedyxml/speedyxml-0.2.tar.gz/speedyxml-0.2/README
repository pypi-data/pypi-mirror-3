Usage is fairly straightforward:

	import speedyxml
	xml = speedyxml.parse('<xml><test this="now" /></xml>')

Will result in:

	(
		u'xml', 
		None, 
		[
			(
				u'test', 
				{u'this': u'now'}, 
				None
			)
		]
	)

So basically its:

	(nodeName, attributes, children)


If you want empty attributes and children to be {} and [] instead of None, use ExpandEmpty=1
