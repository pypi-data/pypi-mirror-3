Description: ## OMDOX
        
        OMDOX is a lightweight documentation builder that utilises [jinja2][0] templates as placeholders for markdown and code.
        
        Code samples are parsed with [pygments][1] and the content is parsed with markdown.
        
        You're in total control of how it looks, feels and responds to different devices.
        
        No magic, it's plain ol' html with a dash of jinja, markdown and pygments. 
        
        ## Features
        
        
        ### Markdown 
        
        All content inside of the {% block content %} is parsed as markdown.
        
        ### code
        
        Any blocks of code inside code tags are parsed; eg
        
        
        ```<code lang="bash">
        pip install omdox
        </code>```
        
        
        An attempt is made to match the lang attribute against [known pygments lexers][2]. If no match is found it defaults to python.
        
        
        
        ## Installation
        
        ```pip install omdox```
        
        ## Usage
        
        1. Make folder for docs
        2. Create layout.html inside of docs folder
        2. Style as you see fit
        3. Create documents that inherit layout.html in your /docs/ directory
        5. cd '/docs/'
        6. run ``omdox``
        
        Your documentation will now be in /docs/_build
        
        ## Watching files for changes
        
        You can run ``omdox --watch`` and only changed files will be built.
        
        ## What about static media?
        
        Proceed as you would building a a normal site. Folders inside of `docs/` get copied into the final build. Just make sure to use relative paths in your html & css.
        
        ## Status
        
        Early alpha.
        
        ## Issues
        
        Create an issue, I'll be all over it like warm butter on hot bread.
        
        
        ### Writing Documentation 
        
        OMDOX will not make you better at writing documentation, only practice will.
