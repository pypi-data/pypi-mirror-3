This is a mirror of the original app (see ORIGINAL README below.)

The small changes I made were just to integrate custom header 
support into the app. This is needed to interface with the 
SuperFeedr.com hub.

============
DEPENDENCIES
============

Requires the django-easyconfig and feedparser packages.

$ sudo pip install django-easyconfig
$ sudo pip install feedparser

# Note, if you install djpubsubhubbub from pip yourself,
# it should handle the dependencies for you.

============
REQUIREMENTS
============

This app assumes you are running at least Python 2.4
and Django 1.2
