bzr-colo Release Notes
######################

bzr-colo 0.4.0
##############

This is a stable release for the Bazaar 2.5.x series.

Improvements
------------

* Set the branch nick to the colocated name.  If desired, the
  directory name can be prepended to the nick by setting the option
  colo.dir_in_nick. (#797578)

Bug Fixes
---------

* Allow colo-pull in sub directory of a branch. (INADA Naoki)

* Keep bound location when doing "bzr colo-ify" on checkouts. (#797578)

* Update blackbox tests for changed output in Bazaar 2.5 series


bzr-colo 0.3.0
##############

This is a stable release for Bazaar's 2.4.x series.

Compatibility Changes
---------------------

* In order to allow some branches to be hidden, colo-branches will not show
  branches whose names start with a period.  To show branches with names that
  start with a period, use "bzr colo-branches --all".  This same convention
  applies to the GUI qbranches command as well. (#767332)

* In accordance with Bazaar's policy on configuration options, the values of
  the sync_from_location and sync_to_location will now be saved as
  "colo.sync_from_location" and "colo.sync_to_location".  To use the new
  option names, do colo-sync-from/to with an explicit location
  parameter again.

Improvements
------------

* Allow synchronization to and from ordinary Bazaar repositories.  To
  synchronize to and from an ordinary shared repository that
  contains branches in subdirectories, use the "--repository" argument with
  colo-sync-from and colo-sync-to. (#612436, Michael Gliwinski)

* colo-branches will hide branches that have the option "bzr.branch.status"
  set to "Hidden", "Abandoned" or "Merged" in the branch's configuration.
  These branches can be shown using "bzr colo-branches --all".  (#774170)

* Add pipe awareness to "colo-prune" so that it doesn't remove colocated
  branches which are part of pipelines.  (Aaron Bentley)

* Add a tool for Bazaar Explorer to log all colocated branches.  
  (#741042, Zunbeltz Izaola)

* Add a checkbox to qbzr windows to show all branches. (Alexander Belchenko)

* Add a qcoloswitch command based on qbzr's qswitch where the branch list 
  is populated with the names of the colocated branches.

* Improve specificity of debug messages that are logged and a configuration
  option "colo.debug" to silence them altogether.  Use "bzr config
  --scope=bazaar colo.debug=False" to stop the plugin from logging any debug
  information.

Bug Fixes
---------

* Install extra files for qbzr and Bazaar Explorer. (#768895)

* Don't remove branches that have other branches in subdirectories. (#771815)


bzr-colo 0.2.1
##############

This is a stable release for the bzr 2.3.x versions.

Compatibility Changes
---------------------

* Bazaar 2.3 removed the development-rich-root, development6-rich-root and
  development7-rich-root formats.  As such, you can no longer do
  ``colo-clean`` on branches in these formats.  If for some reason you still
  have branches in those formats, you can use version 0.2.0 of this plugin.

Bug Fixes
---------

* Fix test suite to run with new script test behavior on Bazaar 2.3 and later.


bzr-colo 0.2.0
##############

Compatibility Changes
---------------------

* Branch names with backslashes are no longer allowed in the colo: specifier,
  due to differing interpretations on different platforms.  Forward slashes
  are still allowed and can be used to make colocated workspaces with
  hierarchical collections of branches.  URL-encoded backslashes ('\' -> %5C)
  are allowed.  
  
  If your filesystem permits directories with backslashes in the name, then
  you can work with those branches directly in .bzr/branches.  If you
  currently have a colocated workspace with branch names that include
  backslashes, then you can rename those branches using filesystem tools
  inside of the .bzr/branches directory. (#612618)

Improvements
------------

* The colo-sync-to and colo-sync-from commands each save a default location
  on their first invocation so that further synchronizations can be done
  simply with ``bzr colo-sync-from`` and ``bzr colo-sync-to``.  A different
  location can always be specified and the default location can be changed 
  using the ``--remember`` option.

* Ignore the "colo:" prefix if specified in the colo-prune command.  Note that
  if you have branches that start with that prefix (!) this change will make it
  harder to delete them.  (#574995)

* Add a "--from-branch" option to the colo-checkout command to allow for
  creating new workspaces from branches other than the current one.
  (#586788, Brian de Alwis)

Bug Fixes
---------

* Fix the test suite with bzr 2.2 by removing the use of run_direct.

* Account for API changes in set_reference between Bazaar 2.1 and 2.2.
  (#603209)

* Correctly normalize remote URLs for workspaces with no working trees.
  (#611006, Michael Gliwinski)

Testing
-------

* Add a rudimentary test suite for qbzr-based commands.

* Adapt to new signature of bzrlib.branch.Branch.set_reference' which now
  needs a "name" parameter for colocated branches (eep!).


bzr-colo 0.1.0
##############

This release should be feature complete, adding the ability to synchronize 
to and from colocated workspaces and pulling from all remote branches 
named "origin/..."  This version also introduces a requirement on Bazaar
versions later than 2.1.

Compatibility Changes
---------------------

* The colo-fetch command now creates the initial branch with the name
  origin/trunk to facilitate use with the new colo-pull command.

* If no second argument is given, colo-fetch creates the workspace with
  a name derived from the fetched location (similar to Bazaar's branch
  command). (#538942)

Improvements
------------

* Add colo-sync-to and colo-sync-from commands to synchronize every branch
  in a colocated workspace with a different workspace.

* Add a ``--no-tree`` option to colo-init that creates a colocated workspace
  without a working tree.  This allows creating colocated workspaces over
  remote transports that don't allow creating working trees.

* Add a colo-pull command that pulls all branches whose names begin with
  "origin/".

* Add a colo-mv command for renaming colocated branches.

* Add a ``--trunk-name`` option to colo-init to specify the name of the 
  initial branch.

Bug Fixes
---------

* Bump the minimum require Bazaar version to 2.1 since we use
  BzrCommand.run_direct. (#550033)

* Declare the minimum Bazaar version in the code.  Avoid breaking the test
  suite on 2.0. (Martin Pool, Neil Martinsen-Burrell)

* Don't delete promiscuously in .bzr/branches.  Require the arguments of
  colo-prune to be the names of branches. (#529760)

* Give better error messages with qbzr import errors.
  (#520485, Alexander Belchenko)

bzr-colo 0.0.2
##############

Compatibility Changes
---------------------

* The colo-clone command was renamed colo-checkout, with a short alias of
  colo-co.  The --create option is now available as -b.  (Alexander Belchenko)

* colo-prune now has an alias of colo-delete.  qprune has a similar alias of
  qdelete.

Improvements
------------

* Define two graphical commands for dealing with colocated branches.
  ``qbranches`` lists the existing colocated branches and ``qprune`` allows
  for deleting colocated branches

* Add support for Bazaar Explorer toolsets for dealing with colocated
  branches.

* Support hierarchical branch names such as "bugs/1234" with a separator of
  "/".  These branches are stored in subdirectories of .bzr/branches.
  (Alexander Belchenko)

* Add a colo-fixup command for the situation where colocated workspaces have
  been moved on disk.

Bug Fixes
---------

* Improve lazy loading.  (Alexander Belchenko)

* List aliases inside each command.  (Alexander Belchenko)

* Improve the error message when using colo: outside of a colocated workspace.
  (#517522, Neil Martinsen-Burrell)

* Document the dependency on recent versions of bzr and qbzr.


bzr-colo 0.0.1
##############

Initial release, including basic functionality for colocated branches.
