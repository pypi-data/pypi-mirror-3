        Django Audited Models provides a simple abstract base class (and factory
        function) for tracking database record creation and modification times, as
        well as the creator of the record and the last user to edit it. It leverages
        two pluggable applications to achieve this:
        
        1. `Django Extensions`_, which provides (amongst many other things) a
           ``CreationDateTimeField`` and ``ModificationDateTimeField``.
        2. `Django Threaded Multihost`_, originally developed for Satchmo_, which
           provides a ``threadlocals`` mechanism that works reliably for Django
           installations powering multiple sites via the ``sites`` framework.
