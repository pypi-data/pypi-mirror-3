Description: mattd - Matt Daemon
        ===================
        
        mattd is a voice-to-text driven plugin system.  Its like an IRCBot for
        "real-life".  The gist:
        
         - Write plugins to carry out actions when you speak certain phrases.
         - Take advantage of `community plugins
           <http://pypi.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=search&term=mattd&submit=search>`_.
        
        Caveat
        ------
        
        Its not pure python.  Your best bet is to install it from `your friendly Linux
        distribution's package management system
        <https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages/mattd>`_.
