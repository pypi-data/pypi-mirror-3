Description: Cutplace is a tool and API to validate that data conform to an interface control document
        (ICD).
        
        Cutplace works with flat data formats using a separator (such as CSV) or fixed length fields. Such formats are commonly
        used to exchange data between different platforms or physically separated systems. Examples are exchanging data
        between different partner companies, providing data for data warehousing or other data processing involving
        architecturally very different systems like mainframes.
        
        With cutplace you can describe these data in a simple and human readable spreadsheets using popular applications
        like Calc or Excel. Unlike a lot of documentation these days, this description does not only describe wishful
        thinking. It acts as "executable specification" which cutplace can use to validate that data actually conform to it.
