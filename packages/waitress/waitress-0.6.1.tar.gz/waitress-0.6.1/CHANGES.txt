0.6.1 (2012-01-08)
------------------

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- Remove performance-sapping call to ``pull_trigger`` in the channel's
  ``write_soon`` method added mistakenly in 0.6.

0.6 (2012-01-07)
----------------

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- A logic error prevented the internal outbuf buffer of a channel from being
  flushed when the client could not accept the entire contents of the output
  buffer in a single succession of socket.send calls when the channel was in
  a "pending close" state.  The socket in such a case would be closed
  prematurely, sometimes resulting in partially delivered content.  This was
  discovered by a user using waitress behind an Nginx reverse proxy, which
  apparently is not always ready to receive data.  The symptom was that he
  received "half" of a large CSS file (110K) while serving content via
  waitress behind the proxy.

0.5 (2012-01-03)
----------------

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- Fix PATH_INFO encoding/decoding on Python 3 (as per PEP 3333, tunnel
  bytes-in-unicode-as-latin-1-after-unquoting).

0.4 (2012-01-02)
----------------

Features
~~~~~~~~

- Added "design" document to docs.

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- Set default ``connection_limit`` back to 100 for benefit of maximal
  platform compatibility.

- Normalize setting of ``last_activity`` during send.

- Minor resource cleanups during tests.

- Channel timeout cleanup was broken.

0.3 (2012-01-02)
----------------

Features
~~~~~~~~

- Dont hang a thread up trying to send data to slow clients.

- Use self.logger to log socket errors instead of self.log_info (normalize).

- Remove pointless handle_error method from channel.

- Queue requests instead of tasks in a channel.

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- Expect: 100-continue responses were broken.


0.2 (2011-12-31)
----------------

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- Set up logging by calling logging.basicConfig() when ``serve`` is called
  (show tracebacks and other warnings to console by default).

- Disallow WSGI applications to set "hop-by-hop" headers (Connection,
  Transfer-Encoding, etc).

- Don't treat 304 status responses specially in HTTP/1.1 mode.

- Remove out of date ``interfaces.py`` file.

- Normalize logging (all output is now sent to the ``waitress`` logger rather
  than in degenerate cases some output being sent directly to stderr).

Features
~~~~~~~~

- Support HTTP/1.1 ``Transfer-Encoding: chunked`` responses.

- Slightly better docs about logging.

0.1 (2011-12-30)
----------------

- Initial release.
