"""Module for calculation and verifying the checksum of a number
using the ISO 7064 Mod 11, 2 algorithm.

Validation can be done with is_valid(). A valid number can be made by
calculating the check digit and appending it.

>>> calc_check_digit('0794')
'0'
>>> is_valid('07940')
True
>>> calc_check_digit('079')
'X'
>>> is_valid('079X')
True
>>> checksum('079X')
1
