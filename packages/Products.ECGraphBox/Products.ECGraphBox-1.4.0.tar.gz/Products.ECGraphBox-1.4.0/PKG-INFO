        Installation
        ============
        
        See the `Installing an Add-on Product`_ tutorial for more detailed 
        product installation instructions.

        Installing with buildout
        ------------------------
        
        If you are using `buildout`_ to manage your instance installing 
        ECGraphBox is very simple.  You can install it by adding it 
        to the eggs line for your instance::
        
          [instance]
          eggs =
              ... 
              Products.ECGraphBox
        
        After updating the configuration you need to run ``bin/buildout``, 
        which will take care of updating your system.
        
        Then restart your zope instance and use the Add/Remove products page
        in Site Setup to install ECGraphBox.
        
        .. _buildout: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zc.buildout
        
        
        Installing without buildout
        ---------------------------
        
        Move (or symlink) the ``ECGraphBox`` folder of this project
        (``Products.ECGraphBox/Products/ECGraphBox``) into 
        the ``Products`` directory of the Zope instance it has to be installed 
        for, and restart the server.  Use the Add/Remove products page in 
        Site Setup to install ECGraphBox.
