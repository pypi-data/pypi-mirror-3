Description: Django Setuptest Recipe
        =======================
        **Recipe to prevent django-setuptest from polluting module being tested with
        downloaded eggs.**

        Motivation
        ----------
        
        django-setuptest downloads eggs required for a test run and places them in the
        module directory. For example, if the module to be tested is called ``foo``
        then the command ``python setup.py test`` causes ``src/foo`` to be polluted
        with many eggs. There is currently no way to instruct setuptools to store these
        eggs in another location.
        
        ``django-setuptest-recipe`` addresses this shortcoming by wrapping the Python
        interpreter to be aware of egg locations.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Add the following to your ``buildout.cfg``::
        
            parts=
                ...
                setuptest-runner
        
            [setuptest-runner]
            recipe = django-setuptest-recipe
            eggs = ${buildout:eggs}
        
        An executable file called ``setuptest-runner`` is created in the ``bin``
        directory. You can now do ``/path/to/instance/bin/setuptest-runner setup.py
        test`` from within the ``src/foo`` directory.
