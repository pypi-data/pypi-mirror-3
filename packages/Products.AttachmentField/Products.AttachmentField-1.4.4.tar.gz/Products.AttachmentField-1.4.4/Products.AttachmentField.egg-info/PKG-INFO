Description: ###############
        AttachmentField
        ###############
        
        An Archetype field that manages file attachments, to be used in place
        of a FileField.
        
        AttachmentField allows you to index and preview various kinds of
        documents, such as MSOffice (Word, Excel, Powerpoint), PDF and more in
        your Archetypes based content types.
        
        This product replaces the former ZAttachmentAttribute from Ingeniweb
        (see ingeniweb.sourceforge.net).
        
        Be sure to read the warnings below before using it.
        
        Warning
        #######
        
        * Due to lots of misuses of AttachmentField, be warned that it does not
        add any new content type by itself. AttachmentField is a product for
        Plone/Archetypes content types developers.
        
        * It is *strongly* discouraged to uninstall AttachmentField while configured to
        use FileSystemStorage. If so, all contents that use AttachmentField would be
        lost (even if you reinstall it later). If you want to upgrade, just reinstall
        it without uninstalling it.
        
        If you need to uninstall AttachmentField, first configure it to use
        AttributeStorage (in ZODB) (default choice). In this case, you can then
        uninstall AttachmentField without loosing your content (You will need to
        reinstall a version of AttachmentField to access them again)
        
        Dependencies
        ############
        
        Python packages
        ===============
        
        * python-libxml2
        
        * python-libxslt
        
        You need these packages for OpenOffice documents support.
        
        These Python extensions are available as packages in most Linux
        distros. Windows users may find a suitable libxml2 + libxslt for
        Python installer from http://users.skynet.be/sbi/libxml-python/
        
        Zope/Plone
        ==========
        
        * Plone 2.1.x
        
        * Archetypes 1.3.7+
        
        * FileSystemStorage (only if you want to use FSS)
        
        Applications/utilities (Unix)
        =============================
        
        * xpdf >= 3.0
        
        * wvware >= 1.0
        
        * xlhtml
        
        * ppthtml
        
        * unrtf >= 0.19
        
        Applications/utilities (win32)
        ==============================
        
        All above listed binary plugins are provided "batteries included" for
        Windows,
        
        The improvements / regressions of AF over ZAA are:
        ##################################################
        
        * AF uses Archetypes' Field design to work. It's, then,
          Archetypes-dependent.
        
        * ZAAPlugins is no longer necessary. All AF plugins are integrated
          directly into the AF product.
        
        * AF offers a convenient plugin structure, allowing you to create
          plugins with only 10 lines of code. Doing so, we've lost a little
          bit of the flexibility we never needed ;) However it's still
          possible to override the AttachmentHandler class to offer more
          flexibility (AttachmentHandler is the new name for
          AbstractAttachment).
        
        * A plugin is now a singleton providing indexing & preview & iconing
          services. No more polymorphism as in ZAA (in ZAA, each and every
          attachement stored an instance of a plugin class, which turned out
          to be too complicated for the actual need).
        
        * A side effect of the preceding point is that you can upload invalid
          files to your server and develop (or configure) new plugins AFTER
          you've uploaded 'em. AF will dynamically detect the new content type
          and will provide preview and indexing support magically. With that
          feature, customers can start populating a website very early in the
          process!
        
        * AF doesn't support images in MSWord preview yet (it will !)
        
        * AF doesnt' store attachments preview nor searchable text in ZODB;
          they are cached though, and will normally be calculated only once
          per Zope program run. This may be configurable in the future
          (ie. you can choose best speed or less disk usage).
        
        Example of use in a AT content type source
