        Introduction
        ============
        
        This library packages `Sugar`_ for `fanstatic`_.
        
        .. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
        .. _`Sugar`: http://sugarjs.com/
        
        This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
        and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
        directory in ``js.sugar``) are published to some URL.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        ``from js.sugar import sugar``
        
        ``sugar.need()``
        
        
        How to use?
        ===========
        
        
        You can import ``XXX`` from ``js.sugar`` and ``need`` it where you want
        these resources to be included on a page::
        
          >>> from js.sugar import XXX # XXX fix this test
          >>> XXX.need()
