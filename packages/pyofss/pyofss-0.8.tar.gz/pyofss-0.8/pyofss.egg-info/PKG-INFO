Description: 
        Pyofss: Python-based optical fibre system simulator
        ***************************************************
        
        Pyofss allows construction of an optical fibre system from separate modules.
        A typical system consists of a Gaussian pulse generator module and an optical 
        fibre module.
        The field generated is propagated through the fibre by numerical integration of 
        an appropriate SchrÃ¶dinger-type equation.
        Simulated effects include that of dispersion (second, third, and higher order), attenuation, self-phase modulation, self-steepening, and Raman scattering.
        Resulting field profiles (including multiple traces for the fibre module) may be visualised using a range of plot types.
        These include standard x-y plots, top-down "map" plots, three-dimensional "waterfall" plots, and animation videos.

        .. warning::
           Some of the following commands may require superuser privileges. Use::
        
              $ sudo command
        
           or::
        
              $ su root
        
           then run the commands.
        
           **Always be cautious when running with enhanced privileges!**
        
        Pyofss is available on Pypi and may be retrieved using the pip program::
        
           $ aptitude install pip
           $ pip install pyofss
        
        Then import pyofss within scripts or in an interactive session:
           >>> from pyofss import *
        
        .. note::
           If the required dependencies are not satisfied when installing pyofss, then manually install using either::
        
              $ aptitude install python-numpy python-scipy python-matplotlib
        
           or::
        
              $ pip install numpy scipy matplotlib
        
           The recommended versions are listed in the "requirements.txt" file within the pyofss package.
           Using this file, it is possible to automatically install all dependencies::
        
              $ pip install -r requirements.txt
