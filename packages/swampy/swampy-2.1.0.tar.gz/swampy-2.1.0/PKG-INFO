Description: ======
        Swampy
        ======
        
        Swampy is a suite of Python programs for use with Think Python, Python
        for Software Design, and The Little Book of Semaphores.
        
        It was written by Allen Downey and is available under the GNU General
        Public License (GPL).
        
        Swampy includes these components:
        
        AmoebaWorld
        
        Provides a fun environment to practice writing Python expressions and
        to introduce object-oriented programming.
        
        TurtleWorld
        
        An implementation of turtle graphics used to teach procedural
        interface design and object-oriented programming.
        
        TurmiteWorld
        
        Allows students to experiment with cellular automata and finite state
        machines, including Langton's Ant. (The misspelling of "termite" is
        deliberate; it is a tribute to Alan Turing).
        
        Sync
        
        A simulator that demonstrates the execution of multithreaded programs
        that interact through Semaphores. Sync is designed to run the examples
        and solutions from The Little Book of Semaphores.
        
        Lumpy
        
        Lumpy stands for "UML in Python". It generates UML class diagrams and
        UML object diagrams from a Python program.
