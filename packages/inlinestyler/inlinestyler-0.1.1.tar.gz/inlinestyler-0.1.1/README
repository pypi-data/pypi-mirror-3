============

Inlinestyler is the styling code behind Dave Cranwell's *Inline Style* app - https://github.com/davecranwell/inline-styler - packaged into a library for ease of use elsewhere.

He writes:

	It's a service which, when given a block of HTML including CSS, 
	will parse the CSS and convert it to inline "style" attributes 
	on each elements matched by the CSS rules found.

	The benefit of this is primarily in developing HTML emails. 
	The most common email clients have patchy support for <style> 
	or <link> elements, but do on the whole support a varied set 
	of CSS properties. Its therefore necessary to instead define 
	styles in "style" attributes on each of the elements 
	themselves, which is tedious for anything but the simplest 
	of emails and introduces significant code maintenance problems. 
	The Inline Styler frees up the developer to write CSS in less 
	tedious/more maintainable ways: using proper selectors and rules, 
	grouped in either a stylesheet or a <style> block. The Inline 
	Styler converts these rules into the inline "style" attributes 
	for you.

	Additionally, among the email clients who do support CSS, support 
	for individual CSS properties is variable. The Inline Styler will
	 analyse your CSS and estimate a compatibility rating across all 
	the email clients as a whole, alerting you to any particular 
	properties likely to reduce compatibility.

	You can see a working example of this service at 
	http://inlinestyler.torchboxapps.com.

	To use this app, CSS to be "inlined" must be presented in the HTML either
	* linked absolutely e.g <link rel="stylesheet" href="http://mysite.com/styles.css" /> or
	* provided in a <style> block in the <head> of the HTML, without @imports
