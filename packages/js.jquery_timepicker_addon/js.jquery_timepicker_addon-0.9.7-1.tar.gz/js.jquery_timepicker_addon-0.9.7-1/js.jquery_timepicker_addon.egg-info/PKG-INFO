        **************************
        
        Introduction
        ============
        
        This library packages `jQuery-Timepicker-Addon`_ for `fanstatic`_.
        
        .. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
        .. _`jQuery-Timepicker-Addon`: https://github.com/trentrichardson/jQuery-Timepicker-Addon
        
        This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
        and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
        directory in ``js.jquery_timepicker_addon``) are published to some URL.
        
        
        How to use?
        ===========
        
        
        You can import ``timepicker`` from ``js.jquery_timepicker_addon`` and ``need``
        it where you want these resources to be included on a page::
        
          >>> from js.jquery_timepicker_addon import timepicker
          >>> timepicker.need()
