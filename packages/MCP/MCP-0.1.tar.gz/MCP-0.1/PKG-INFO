         MCP
        =====
        
        A program to orchestrate Entellect Challenge bot matches. The Entellect
        Challenge is a Tron AI competition.
        
        Named after Master Control Program (MCP) from the Tron movies. To contribute
        back just send a pull request on https://github.com/keegancsmith/MCP or
        https://bitbucket.org/keegan_csmith/mcp
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        The only dependency for MCP is Python 2.7 (although it may work on Python
        3.x). Just run ``mcp.py``. Alternatively you can install the script with
        distutils. Just run ``python setup.py install`` in the current directory.
        
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        To run against a random AI run::
        
          $ mcp.py local --player1 '/path/to/your/ai' --player2 'mcp.py randomai'
        
        You can adjust *player1* and *player2* accordingly. The default command to run
        for a player is ``start.sh`` or ``start.bat`` (depending if you are on a UNIX
        variant or not).
        
        MCP has other functionality. Pass ``--help`` to the command to find out more::
        
          $ mcp.py --help
          $ mcp.py remote --help
