        waiting (as is the case with `producers`, for example), then a

    """`Interface` that defines a container.

    Containers are responsible for containing :class:`ICoroutine` objects and
    the `links` that connect them both to each other and to the container
    itself, if appropriate.

    All containers should calculate and provide :attr:`~IContainer.coroutines`
    and :attr:`~IContainer.links` attributes before they are used. The contents
    of :attr:`~IContainer.coroutines` should be able to be passed to the
    appropriate :meth:`IScheduler.register` method and the contents of
    :attr:`~IContainer.links` should be able to be passed to the appropriate
    :meth:`~IPostOffice.register` method.

    Additionally, containers can contain other :class:`IContainer` objects, in
    other words other containers.  In such a case,
    :attr:`~IContainer.coroutines` and :attr:`~IContainer.links` should include
    the `coroutines` and `links` from the sub-containers, excluding any
    duplicates from the other `coroutines` and `links` in the parent container.

    .. note:: Containers will usually provide :class:`ICoroutine` as well, but
        that is not strictly required by this interface.  The calculation and
        use of the above-mentioned two attributes makes it not a strict
        requirement.
