Description: winshell Module
        ***************
        
        What is it?
        -----------
        
        Certain aspects of the Windows user interface are grouped by
        Microsoft as Shell functions. These include the Desktop, shortcut
        icons, special folders (such as My Documents) and a few other things.
        These are mostly available via the shell module of the pywin32
        extensions, but whenever I need to use them, I've forgotten the
        various constants and so on.
        
        Several of the shell items have two variants: personal and common,
        or User and All Users. These refer to systems with profiles in use:
        anything from NT upwards, and 9x with Profiles turned on. Where
        relevant, the Personal/User version refers to that owned by the
        logged-on user and visible only to that user; the Common/All Users
        version refers to that maintained by an Administrator and visible
        to all users of the system.
        
        There are other generally useful functions which are grouped under
        the heading of shell-related, for example moving & copying files
        with animated progress icons and deleting them into the system
        recycle bin.
        
        The module has three main parts:
        
        * :doc:`special-folders`
        * File Operations
        * Structured Storage

        Prerequisites
        -------------
        
        The module has been tested on versions of Python from 2.4 to 3.2. It may work
        on older (or newer) versions but I don't have those installed for testing.
        It's tested with the most recent pywin32 extensions, but the functionality
        it uses from those libraries has been in place for many versions.
