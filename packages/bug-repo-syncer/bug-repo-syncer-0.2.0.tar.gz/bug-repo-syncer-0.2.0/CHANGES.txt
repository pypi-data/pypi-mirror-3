Release 0.2.0
=============

Features
--------

* Added global option ``--version``. It shows the program's version, and a
  license notice.

* Sub-command ``sync``: added option ``--dry-run`` if used, program does not
  modify the repositories, but prints what the program would normally do.
  
* Sub-command ``info``: test the repository configuration data, program tries
  anonymous login. 

* added ability to use Launchpad's test servers ("staging", "qastaging"). 
  This lead to change in file format.

* Automatically add unknown milestones to the internal data (the translator).
  This does not add a milestone to the repository itself. This will
  nevertheless make new milestones appear in Trac repositories automatically.
  Milestones only have to be put into the milestone translator explicitly, when
  you use different names for them in your repositories. The feature can be
  switched off.

* changed file format

* Better error messages for broken configuration and data files.

* more tests for high level functionality.
  
Bugs
----

* Unicode fixes

* Crash when loading broken data file.
