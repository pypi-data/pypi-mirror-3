1) install the Python-related packages
	sudo apt-get install python python-dev python-support cython

2) now VTK
	sudo apt-get install libvtk5.8 python-vtk

3) now ODE
	- unpack ode-0.12.{tar.bz2|tar.gz|zip|7z}
	- run (command line)
		cd ode-0.12
		#### for versions obtained from SVN (not official releases) do: ######
		./autogen.sh
			if this fails, install (at least)
				libtool
				autoconf
				automake
		#########################################################
		./configure --enable-double-precision --with-trimesh=opcode --enable-new-trimesh --enable-shared --enable-debug
		make
		sudo make install
		#### if you'd rather use the checkinstall program, run instead: ######
		sudo checkinstall make install

4) now the python bindings (previously PyODE)
	- run (command line)
		cd bindings/python/
		python setup.py build_ext
		sudo python setup.py install

5) finally, ARS
	- unpack the archive
	- run
		sudo apt-get install python-pyrex
		sudo python setup.py install

6) for a test, demos and documentation read INSTALL


TROUBLESHOOTING

Python
	ODE
		ImportError:
			It means ODE could not be imported. To replicate, run the python interpreter
				python
			execute: import ode
			the error sould raise again. The most probable reason is that the
			library (e.g. libode.so.3) cannot be located, even though
			it was installed in /usr/local/lib . If that is the case, then the
			issue has to do with the "system library path" NOT the "python library path".
			Run:
				sudo nano /etc/ld.so.conf.d/local_lib.conf
					enter: /usr/local/lib
				sudo ldconfig
			That's it, try importing ODE again, preferably in the interpreter.
