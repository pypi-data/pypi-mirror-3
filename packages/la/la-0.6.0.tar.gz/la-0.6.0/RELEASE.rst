la 0.6 
======

*Release date: 2012-03-19*

Older versions
==============

Release notes from past releases.

la 0.5 
------

*Release date: 2011-04-28*

The fifth release of la is faster and adds fast, moving window methods to
larry. The cost of the speed and new functionality is that la now requires the
Bottleneck package (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Bottleneck).

**Faster**

- sum, mean, std, var, min, max, median, ranking
- correlation, group_median, demean, demedian, zscore

**Moving window**

- fast (Bottleneck): move_sum, move_mean, move_std, move_min, move_max
- slow (Python): move_ranking, move_median, move_func

**New methods and functions**

- la.data.yahoo.quotes(): Given a ticker sequence, return historical Yahoo!
  quotes (open, close, high, low, volume) as a 3d larry
- Numpy array functions that ignore NaNs: demean, demedian, and zscore
- la.unique(): Find the unique elements of a larry
- larry.tofile(): Save 1d or 2d larry to text file

**Enhancements**

- Add optional `ddof` input parameter to larry.std() and larry.var() 
- Cut import time by 15%

**Breakage from la 0.4**

- Bottleneck is now a dependency of la
- ranking() and group_rank() no longer take a `ties` input parameter
- movingsum no longer treats Inf and -Inf as missing values
- movingsum and movingrank have been deprecated and will be removed in la 0.6;
  use move_sum and move_ranking instead

**Bugs fixes**

- Please report bugs at https://github.com/kwgoodman/la/issues
- #1 Due to a typo, la.info() crashed if h5py could not be imported
- #2 larry.sortaxis(None) chopped off singleton dimensions
- #5 la.farray.lastrank() choked on empty array input
- #7 larry.quantile() choked on axis=None
- #8 demean, demedian, zscore choked on 1d input when axis=-1
- #9 cross_validation docstring refers to old name of function (cv) 
- #10 Unit tests: "Warning: invalid value encountered in..." 

la 0.4
------

*Release date: 2010-07-06*

The focus of this release was binary operations between unaligned larrys with
user control of the join method (five available) and the fill method. A
general binary function, la.binaryop(), was added as were the convenience
functions add, subtract, multiply, divide. Supporting functions such as
la.align(), which aligns two larrys, were also added.

**New larry methods**

- ismissing: A bool larry with element-wise marking of missing values
- take: A copy of the specified elements of a larry along an axis

**New functions**

- rand: Random samples from a uniform distribution
- randn: Random samples from a Gaussian distribution
- missing_marker: Return missing value marker for the given larry
- ismissing: A bool Numpy array with element-wise marking of missing values
- correlation: Correlation of two Numpy arrays along the specified axis
- split: Split into train and test data along given axis
- listmap_fill: Index map a list onto another and index of unmappable elements
- listmap_fill: Cython version of listmap_fill
- align: Align two larrys using one of five join methods
- info: la package information such as version number and HDF5 availability
- binaryop: Binary operation on two larrys with given function and join method
- add: Sum of two larrys using given join and fill methods
- subtract: Difference of two larrys using given join and fill methods
- multiply: Multiply two larrys element-wise using given join and fill methods
- divide: Divide two larrys element-wise using given join and fill methods

**Enhancements**

- listmap now has option to ignore unmappable elements instead of KeyError
- listmap.pyx now has option to ignore unmappable elements instead of KeyError
- larry.morph() is much faster as are methods, such as merge, that use it

**Breakage from la 0.3**

- Development moved from launchpad to github
- func.py and afunc.py renamed flarry.py and farray.py to match new flabel.py.
  Broke: "from la.func import stack"; Did not break: "from la import stack"
- Default binary operators (+, -, ...) no longer raise an error when no labels
  overlap 

**Bug fixes**

- #590270 Index with 1d array bug: lar[1darray,:] worked; lar[1darray] crashed

la 0.3
------

*Release date: 2010-06-04*

**New larry methods**

- astype: Copy of larry cast to specified type
- geometric_mean: new method based on existing array function

**New functions**

- la.util.resample.cross_validation: k-fold cross validation index iterator
- la.util.resample.bootstrap: bootstrap index iterator
- la.util.misc.listmap: O(n) version of map(list1.index, list2)
- la/src/clistmap.pyx: Cython version of listmap with python fallback

**Enhancements**

- Major performance boost in most larry methods!
- You can now use an optional dtype when creating larrys
- You can now optionally skip the integrity test when creating a new larry
- Add ability to compare (==, >, !=, etc) larrys with lists and tuples
- Documentation and unit tests

**Breakage from la 0.2**

- lastrank and lastrank_decay methods combined into one method: lastrank
- Given shape (n,m) input, lastrank now returns shape (n,) instead of (n,1)
- geometric_mean now reduces input in the same way as lastrank (see above)

**Bug fixes**

- #571813 Three larry methods crashed on 1d input
- #571737 skiprows missing from parameters section of the fromcsv doc string
- #571899 label indexing fails when larry is 3d and index is a tuple of len 2
- #571830 prod, cumprod, and cumsum did not return NaN for all-NaN input
- #572638 lastrank chokes on input with a shape tuple that contains zero
- #573240 Reduce methods give wrong output with shapes that contain zero
- #582579 la.afunc.nans: wrong output for str and object dtype
- #583596 assert_larry_equal crashed when comparing float larry to str larry
- #585694 cumsum and cumprod crashed on dtype=int

- Added ability to save larrys with datetime.date labels to HDF5
- New function (panel) to convert larry of shape (n, m, k) to shape (m*k, n)

- #518106: la.larry.fromdict({}) failed
- #518114: fromlist([]) and fromtuples([]) failed

- #518215: unflatten crashed on an empty larry
- #518442: sum, std, var returned NaN for shapes that contain zero: (2, 0, 3)
