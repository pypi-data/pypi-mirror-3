Q: Does Gaphor work on Windows

A: Yes it does. Check out the gaphor-win32-libs package in Gaphor's subversion
   repository. It contains all the libraries required to get Gaphor up and
   running. All you need more is a Python 2.4 installation (the libraries are
   compiled for Python 2.4, not 2.5).
