Description: ============
         hgallpaths
        ============
        
        A mercurial extension to allow pushing and pulling from all paths specified in
        the configuration.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Add hgallpaths extension to your ~/.hgrc::
        
          [extensions]
          hgallpaths = /path/to/hgallpaths.py
        
        The list of all paths is available from the ``paths`` command::
        
          $ hg paths
        
        
        Alternatively you can install hgallpaths with ``pip``::
        
          $ pip install hgallpaths
        
        or with ``setuptools``::
        
          $ python setup.py install
        
        With either of those methods you don't need to specify the path to hgallpaths
        in your hgrc configuration::
        
          [extensions]
          hgallpaths = /path/to/hgallpaths.py
        
        
        Configuration
        -------------
        
        You can exclude certain paths in the configuration. For example to always
        exclude the path ``foo`` and ``bar``, as well as exclude ``baz`` when pushing
        you add this to your ~/.hgrc (or repo hgrc)::
        
          [hgallpaths]
          exclude = foo bar
          exclude_push = baz
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        The two commands supported at the moment are ``pushall`` and ``pullall``. For
        example to push to all paths run::
        
          $ hg pushall
