hrdns is shortcut from h(etzner)r(obot)dns. I chosen shorter version because of possible license/trademark issues.
Hetzner.de provides great hosting services in western europe. As their client, I wanted to automate some
parts of our(me & my current company) infrastracture.
This tool covers dns-management in Hetzner's Robot panel.

Installation
============
You need access to pstats module from python's standard library. On ubuntu it 
can be installed by following command:
    sudo apt-get installl python-profiler
Then you can install hrdns by typing:
    easy_install hrdns

Examples of commandline usage
=============================

List of maintaned domains:
    hrobot_dns.py list -u<user> -p<password>

Add new domain:
    hrobot_dns.py add -u<user> -p<password> -d domain.com -i 8.8.8.8

Delete domain:
    hrobot_dns.py delete -u<user> -p<password> -d domain.com

Dump dns records:
    hrobot_dns.py show -u<user> -p<password> -d domain.com

Updating dns recods (from file):
    hrobot_dns.py update -u<user> -p<password> -d domain.com -f dnsrecords.txt

== Storing username and password in safe way == 
There 3 ways to pass username/password to script: 
1. Passing it through params which is unsafe.
2. Environment variables HRDNS_USER, HRDNS_PASSWORD like this:
export HRDNS_USER=<user> 
export HRDNS_PASSWORD=<password>
hrobot_dns.py list

3. By creating file ~/.hrdnsrc with source like this:
[hrdns]
user=<user>
password=<password> 

FAQ
===
Q: I've deleted domain but it's still in `hrobot_dns.py list`!
A: It's caused by delay of Hetzner's panel. I didn't find better solution than just wait.
