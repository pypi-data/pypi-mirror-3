"""
Simple HTTP client that can be used throughout the whole application. It can use SSL which is turned off by default.

Uses httplib2 library available on http://code.google.com/p/httplib2/. that is included in the vendor package.

There are plenty of configuration possibilities passed here as a dictionary. Possible keys are:
  - default_protocol - http|https, if not specified a http protocol is set as a default protocol
  - ssl_certificates_file - File with the list of allowed/verified certificates, this is an useful option when we
      have self-signed certificates. We do not have to place them in the system wide repository, the simple file is sufficient. During every SSL request, the Httplib then verifies the certificate
      that the contacted server issued. If it is not contained in this file, the certificate is considered invalid and the request is not completed. Such error is propagated as a ClientException and
      has to be handled by the caller of the request. Debugging of such error is not straightforward, so you should always ensure proper list of certificates for all components in the claun system.
      If no file is specified, the default system certificate repository is used.
  - credentials - an optional dictionary that may be used to specify the method of 'signing' all outgoing requests (see credentials_decorators module). If the section is omitted, no 'signing' is done.
    - handler - 'default' or class that will handle/decorate the outgoing requests. (see credentials_decorators module for examples). Default handler is specified in DEFAULT_DECORATOR field in this module.
    - other keys are handler-specific

        Sets up the HTTP client. For configuration dictionary options, see the module documentation.

        Apart from SSL, a credentials_decorator may be instantiated based on the passed configuration.
        Credentials decorators are implemented in credentials_decorators module in this package.
        They are used to 'sign' all outgoing requests to provide higher level of security when
        requesting the server. This might include Basic HTTP authentication, Digest HTTP authentication
        or other (even application specific) methods. It is possible to implement more logic in the decorator
        and sign requests for different resources with different methods.

        The key principle is the delegation of the whole request to the decorator when one is defined.
        Thanks to this delegation even multiple requests may be performed to obtain a protected resource.

        For more credentials decorator information see the credentials_decorators module.
