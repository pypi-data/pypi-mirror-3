Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        Polymaps provides speedy display of multi-zoom datasets over maps,
        and supports a variety of visual presentations for tiled vector data,
        in addition to the usual cartography from OpenStreetMap, CloudMade,
        Bing, and other providers of image-based web maps.
        
        collective.geo.polymaps uses collective.geo to store the mapcontent.
        It is a drop in replacement for collective.geo.mapwidget.
