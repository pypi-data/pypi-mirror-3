What is i3?
-----------

Well, from [i3's website](http://i3wm.org/) itself:

> i3 is a tiling window manager, completely written from scratch. The target
> platforms are GNU/Linux and BSD operating systems, our code is Free and Open
> Source Software (FOSS) under the BSD license. i3 is primarily targeted at
> advanced users and developers.

i3-py contains tools for i3 users and Python developers. To avoid the confusion,
I'll be refering to i3 as _i3-wm_ from here on.

The contents of i3-py project are:

 - __i3.py__, a Python module for communicating with i3-wm
 - __i3-ipc__, a command-line script that wraps some of i3.py's features
 - __i3wsbar__, a Python implementation of i3-wm workspace bar


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


i3.py
=====

First, the basics
-----------------

The communication with i3-wm is through sockets. There are 7 types of messages:

 - command (0)
 - get_workspaces (1)
 - subscribe (2)
 - get_outputs (3)
 - get_tree(4)
 - get_marks (5)
 - get_bar_config (6)

You can control i3-wm with _command_ messages. Other message types return
information about i3-wm without changing its behaviour.

_Subscribe_ offers 2 event types (read: _changes_) to subscribe for:

 - workspace (0)
 - output (1)

There are various ways to do this with i3.py. Let's start with...


Sending commands
----------------

This is best explained by an example. Say you want to switch a layout from the
current one to tabbed. Here's how to do it:

```python
import i3
success = i3.layout('tabbed')
if success:
    print('Successfully changed layout of the current workspace.')
```

Each command is just a function which excepts any number of parameters. i3.py
joins such function and its parameters into a message to i3-wm.

Since a full message of the above command is "layout tabbed", it could also be
written like so:

```python
i3.layout__tabbed()
```

Any double underscores are replaced by a space in a message to i3-wm.

Saying this, you might have guessed that none of these functions are actually
implemented. i3.py checks each attribute as it is accessed. If it exists in the
module, it returns that attribute. Otherwise it creates a function on the fly.
Calling that function sends a message to i3-wm, based on the name of the
attribute and its parameters.


Other message types
-------------------

OK, command is one type of message, but what about the other ones? Well, they
have to be accessed in a bit different way. You see, when we changed the layout
to tabbed, we didn't have to say that it's a _command_ type of message. But for
other types we'll have to specify the name of the type.

So, getting a list of workspaces (and displaying them) is as simple as this:

```python
import i3
workspaces = i3.get_workspaces()
for workspace in workspaces:
    print(workspace['name'])
```

If the attribute you accessed is an existing message type, then the resulting
function sends a message as a parameter. In fact, we could change the current
layout to stacked like so:

```python
import i3
i3.command('layout', 'stacking')
```

This works for all message types. Actually, if you want to get even lower,
there's this function:

```python
import i3
i3.msg(<message type>, <message>)
```

A message type can be in other formats, as an example here are the alternatives
for get_outputs: GET_OUTPUTS, '3', 3

i3.py is case insensitive when it comes to message types. This also holds true
for accessing non-existent attributes, like `i3.GeT_OuTpUtS()`.


Convenience functions
---------------------

Since all returned data is in a form of a dictionaries or lists, some
convenience function have been written.

### i3.window

This function will except a command and window class or/and title. For example,
let's say you want to focus a window titled 'My document - Some editor'. This
translates to `[title="My document - Some editor"] focus` in i3's syntax and can
be done like so from i3-py:
`i3.command('[title="My document - Some editor"] focus')`. This not very
convenient, however. So, there's this function:

```python
i3.window('focus', title='My document - Some editor')
```

You can also add class with `cls` keyword argument.


### i3.filter

Some calls to i3 will return a huge amount of data, namely `i3.get_tree`. It can
be quite stressful to find what you want in such large dictionary. i3-py
provides this convenience function that will filter the given tree:

```python
i3.filter(focused=False)
```

The above would get you all unfocused nodes in the tree. One useful thing would
be to get a list of focused windows. Since windows are just leaf nodes (that is,
nodes without sub-nodes), you can do this:

```python
i3.filter(nodes=[], focused=True)
```

You can also supply your own tree with `tree` keyword argument.


Lets continue to more advanced stuff...


Subscribing to events
---------------------

Say you want to display information about workspaces whenever a new workspaces
is created. There's a function for that called _subscribe_:

```python
import i3
i3.subscribe('workspace')
```

_Workspace_ is one of the two event types. The other one is _output_, which
watches for output changes.

Just displaying the list of workspaces isn't very useful, we want to actually
do something. Because of that, you can define your own subscription:

```python
import i3

def my_function(event, data, subscription):
    <do something based on the event and data received>
    if <enough of this, let's end subscription>:
        subscription.close()

subscription = i3.Subscription(my_function, 'workspace')
```

There are more parameters available for Subscription class, but some are too
advanced for what has been explained so far.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
__NOTE:__ Everything in i3-py project contains a doc string. You can get help
about any feature like so:

```python
import i3
help(i3.Subscription)
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Okay, so now let's move to some of the more lower-level stuff...


Sockets
-------

Sockets are created with the help of `i3.Socket` class. The class has the
following parameters, all of them optional:

 - path of the i3-wm's socket
 - timeout in seconds when receiving the message
 - chunk size in bytes of a single chunk that is send to i3-wm
 - magic string, that i3-wm checks for (it is "i3-ipc")

The path, if not provided, is retrieved via this unmentioned function:

```python
i3.get_socket_path()
```

The most common-stuff methods of an `i3.Socket` object are `connect`, `close`
and `msg(msg_type, payload='')`. Example of usage:

```python
import i3
socket = i3.Socket()
response = socket.msg(`command`, `focus right`)
socket.close()
```

To check if socket has been closed use the `socket.connected` property. There's
even more lower-level stuff, like packing and unpacking the payload, sending
it and receiving it... See the docs for these.


Exceptions
----------

There are three exceptions:

 - `i3.MessageTypeError`, raised when you use unavailable message type
 - `i3.EventTypeError`, raised when you use unavaible event type
 - `i3.MessageError`, raised when i3 sends back an error (the exception contains
   that error string)

If you want to get the list of available ones from Python, use `i3.MSG_TYPES`
and `i3.EVENT_TYPES`.

Okay, that's all for now. Some stuff has been left out, so be
sure to check the docs via Python's `help` function.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

i3-ipc
======

i3-ipc is a Python implementation of an i3-ipc interface and is actually just a
wrapper around some of the features of i3.py. At the moment it is more or less
just a clone of an already existing program called i3-msg from the i3-wm itself.

Usage
-----

    usage: i3-ipc [-h] [-s <socket>] [-t <type>] [-T <timeout>]
                  [<message> [<message> ...]]
    
    i3-ipc 0.3.0 (2012-02-06). Implemented in Python.
    
    positional arguments:
      <message>     message or "payload" to send, can be multiple strings
    
    optional arguments:
      -h, --help    show this help message and exit
      -s <socket>   custom path to an i3 socket file
      -t <type>     message type in text form (e.g. "get_tree")
      -T <timeout>  seconds before socket times out, floating point values allowed

Examples
--------

    $ i3-ipc focus left
    {'success': True}
    $ i3-ipc -t get_tree
    <huge dictionary>
    $ i3-ipc -t 3    # equivalent to i3-ipc -t get_outputs
    $ i3-ipc -t workspace init    # equivalent to i3-ipc -t subscribe workspace init
    <events>
    <CTRL-C>
    $ i3-ipc workspace 5: media    # switches to workspace named "5: media"
    {'success': True}


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


i3wsbar
=======

i3wsbar is an example of how can i3.py be used in Python code. i3wsbar.py uses
__dzen2__ by default. Any arguments that you pass to i3wsbar will be passed to
dzen2.

If you want to customize workspace button colors, you can do so by editing the
provided script that launches an i3wsbar. i3wsbar module contains an class
called Colors, which contains all possible colors. Again, see the docs.
