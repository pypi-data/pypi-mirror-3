        What is ztfy.scheduler ?
        ========================
        
        ztfy.scheduler is a base package for those which need to build scheduled tasks which can run:
        
         - on a cron-style base,
         - at a given date/time (like the "at" command)
         - at a given interval.
        
        Scheduling is done through the APScheduler (http://packages.python.org/APScheduler/) package and
        so all these kinds of tasks can be scheduled with the same sets of settings.
        
        
        How to use ztfy.scheduler ?

        Known bugs
        ==========
        
         - Sometimes, deleting a task doesn't delete the matching job and the whole scheduler have to
           be restarted, generally via a whole server shutdown and restart.
