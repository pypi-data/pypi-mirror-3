ChordFinder v0.1

To use ChordFinder, simply type the notes into the text box, and any appropriate chord names
will appear above. To denote sharp or flat notes, use "#" and "b" respectively. Notes may
be separated by anything, or not separated at all. Pressing enter, if the input box has focus,
will clear the input box. To exit the program, press escape.
