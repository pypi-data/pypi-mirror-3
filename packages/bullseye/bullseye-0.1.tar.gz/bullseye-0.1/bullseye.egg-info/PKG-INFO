Description: Bullseye is a laser beam analysis application. Images can be
        acquired from any USB or Firewire camera using the DC1394
        standard supported by pydc1394 or pyflycapture2 from pointgrey.
        The beam analysis mostly adhere to ISO-11146 and determines
        centroid, 4-sigma width (~1/e^2 intensity width), rotation and
        ellipticity. The user interface is build on enthought/{traits,
        traitsui, chaco}.
