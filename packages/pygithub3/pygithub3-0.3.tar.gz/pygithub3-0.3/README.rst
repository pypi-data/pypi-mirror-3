Pygithub3
==========

Pygithub3 is a wrapper to the **Github API v3**,
written in Python.

It has been developed with extensibility in mind, because the ``API`` is in a
beta state, trying to achieve a very loosly coupled software.

It should be very easy to extend to support new ``requests`` and ``resources``,
because each of them are managed by itself.
