        =============
        
        This package change the "contact info" behavior of your Plone Site,
        adding the information about the context where the user were when he
        accessed the contact form.
        
        In this way the Site Manager will receive an additional URL indicating
        the position of the "problem".
        
        This is very useful if users send messages like:
        
        - "*I get an error in this page*" (but he don't say where)
        - "*I can't access the page*" (but he don't say where)
