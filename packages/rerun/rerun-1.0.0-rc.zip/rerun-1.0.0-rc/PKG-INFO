Description: Usage
        =====
        
        ::
        
            rerun [command]
        
        e.g::
        
            rerun python -m unittest mypackage.mymodule
        
        will rerun your tests every time you save your source code. Handy for seeing
        the new test results in a console window after you hit 'save' in your editor,
        without having to change window focus.
        
        For options, see::
        
            rerun --help
        
        It detects changes to files by polling file modification times once per second.
        On detecting any changes, it clears the terminal and then reruns the given
        command once.
        
        It ignores directories called .svn, .git, .hg, .bzr, build and dist.
        It ignores files ending with .pyc or .pyo.

        ========
        
        Polling for modification times isn't ideal, but in practice I haven't noticed
        it burden my machine in project directories containing hundreds of files.
        
        Thanks

        The idea came from the bash command 'watch', and inspiration for this
        implementation came from an old blog post by Jeff Winkler, whos website
        http://jeffwinkler.net seems to have now died.
