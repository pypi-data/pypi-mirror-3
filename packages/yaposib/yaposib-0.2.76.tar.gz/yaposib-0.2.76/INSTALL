Building an egg with support for other solvers
==============================================

In order to profit from yaposib full capabilities, you need to recompile
it for yourself. Work should be done in the future in order to avoid this
step, but this mostly depends on OSI and the way its packaging will
evolve.

Dependencies
============

yaposib depends on
  * boost python (http://www.boost.org)
  * coin-osi (https://projects.coin-or.org/Osi)
You need to install both of them in order to compile it.

Procedure
=========

On GNU Linux
============

  * Install the dependencies
  * Modify the file build.conf according to your OSI installation
  * Run 'python setup.py bdist_egg'
  * Install the egg generated in dist/ with easy_install

On MS Windows
=============

Untested, help wanted.

Troubleshooting
===============
