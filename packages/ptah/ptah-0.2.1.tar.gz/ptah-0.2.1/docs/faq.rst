Ptah Q & A
==========

What is scope of Ptah?
----------------------

Ptah aims to provide a framework which makes low level choices for developers so the programmer can get on with solving their problems on a unrealistic deadline.  :py:mod:`ptah.cms` is an API it is not an applictaion. The API does not have advanced CMS functionality such as staging, workflow or versioning.  That is someone elses job.

Ptah is a framework, an implementation and set of opinions around the Pyramid web framework.  

Ptah, like Pyramid, supports both URL dispatch, traversal.  Unlike Pyramid it provides a data model, content heirarchy,  form library, and high level security primitives (permissions, roles, and principals).  Any of this is additional to Pyramid and augements your application.

Where does Pyramid and Ptah differ?
-----------------------------------

Ptah attempts to provide a "full stack" on top of Pyramid whereas Pyramid urges you to find and use individual libraries.  
 
Why does Ptah not use deform?
-----------------------------

Ptah does not use deform; but you can.  Ptah ships with a form subsystem, :py:mod:`ptah.form` which you should give a shot. 

Why does Ptah use a Folder paradigm?
------------------------------------

Ptah *does not* require a Folder paradigm or containment.  `examples/ptah_minicms` demonstrates the features of ptah.cms and one of those features are content hierarchies.  Thus the Page/Folder experience in ptah.cmsapp.  We currently have a Poll add-on which does not participate in Page/Folder heirarchy.

Why does Ptah use sqlite?
-------------------------

Ptah uses SQLAlchemy which supports many different database drivers.  sqlite ships with Python obviating the need to install a separate database daemon.  ptah.cms will not depend on database specific features to gain performance or scalability.

SQLAlchemy is complex and scary
-------------------------------

SQLAlchemy is a comprehensive library and an effect of that is it can feel overwhelming when reviewing the documentation.  SQLAlchemy is
the best thing we have in Python.

Traversal, wtf?
---------------

Traversal is not required.  It is optional.  It is a feature which can you use if you like.  Traversal works quite well & if you have used Apache - you have used traversal - instead of a database Apache uses a filesystem.

Getting a pkg_resources.DistributionNotFound: myapp Exception
-------------------------------------------------------------

This means that you did not run ``python setup.py develop`` on your package.  This is Python and you need to add your
package to the python path/virtual environment. e.g.::

  $ bin/pcreate -t template mypackage
  $ cd mypackage
  $ ../bin/python setup.py develop
  $ ../bin/pserve settings.ini

Where did Paster Go?
--------------------

ptah 0.1 used Pyramid 1.2 and Paster.  Pyramid 1.3 removed the dependency on Paster and rolled the functionality directly into the pyramid framework.  pcreate and pserver are scripts which are now generated by Pyramid.
