Future releases:

[ ] - User deletion, make sure this is sensible and conservative (IUserManagement, doDeleteUser)
    [ ] - Make this user-configurable?
    [ ] - Mark an 'inactive' boolean on the object in SF instead of completely removing it?
[ ] - some autogenerated help text that let's you know which fields are required on join form
      if doAddUser is enabled (deferred)
[ ] - enable caching of passwords by default
