Description: Introduction
        ============
        The solely intention of this product is to show in Image and News Item content types an icon-toolbar viewlet in the plone.abovecontentbody viewlet manager.
        
        By keeping the user in the same page and requiring less clicks and page loads we intend to ease applying transformations in the images.
        
        This is an alternative to `collective.atimage.transformmenu <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/collective.atimage.transformmenu>`_.
        
        Features
        ========
        
        - Toolbar is in plone.abovecontentbody viewlet manager for Image and News Item
        - Performs image transformations with AJAX to prevent reloading the page
        - Degrades gracefully in non-JavaScript browsers
        - i18n support by using atcontentypes and plone i18n domains.
        - Tested in Plone 3.3.5 and Plone 4.0
        - 'Transforms' tab is hidden in Image objects as its functionalities are now provided by the toolbar.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        * Add ``collective.atimage.transformtoolbar`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.::
        
            [buildout]
            ...
            eggs =
                ...
                collective.atimage.transformtoolbar
        
        * Tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug::
        
            [instance]
            recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
            ...
            zcml =
                collective.atimage.transformtoolbar
        
        * Re-run buildout, e.g. with::
        
            $ ./bin/buildout
        
        You can skip the ZCML slug if you are using Plone 3.3 or if you are going to explicitly include
        the package from another package's configure.zcml file.

        The icons used in this package were thankfully taken from `famfamfam.com <http://www.famfamfam.com/>`_ website, where Mark James offers for free his 1000 icons work under the `Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License <http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/>`_
        
        Icons below were renamed to ease the implementation of this solution:
        
         * ``shape_flip_vertical``: ``transform-0.gif``
         * ``shape_flip_horizontal``: ``transform-1.gif``
         * ``shape_rotate_anticlockwise``: ``transform-2.gif``
         * ``shape_rotate_clockwise``: ``transform-4.gif``
        
        ``transform-3.gif`` icon is an adaptation of ``shape_flip_horizontal``.
