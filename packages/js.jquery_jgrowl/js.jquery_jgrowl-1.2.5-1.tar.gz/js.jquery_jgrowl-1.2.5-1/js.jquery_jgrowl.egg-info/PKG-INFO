        ****************
        
        Introduction
        ============
        
        This library packages `jQuery jGrowl`_ for `fanstatic`_. It is aware of different modes (normal, minified).
        
        .. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
        .. _`jQuery jGrowl`: http://www.stanlemon.net/projects/jgrowl.html
        
        This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
        and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
        directory in ``js.jquery_jgrowl``) are published to some URL.
        
        How to use?
        ===========
        
        You can import jQuery jGrowl from ``js.jquery_jgrowl`` and ``need`` it
        where you want these resources to be included on a page::
        
          >>> from js.jquery_jgrowl import jquery_jgrowl
          >>> jquery_jgrowl.need()
