   Welcome to ARS's documentation!
   ===============================

.. warning:: This software and its documentation are currently under development so they will be subject to many changes.

..
   :Release: |version|
   :Date: |today|

Welcome! This is the documentation for Autonomous Robot Simulator |version|, last updated |today|.

ARS is programmed in a marvelous language called Python. Of the many features
that make it great (and have many users) is its documentation. Taking that
into consideration, many of the sections herein were taken from the
`official Python documentation <http://docs.python.org/>`_.


So simple
==========
To create your first simulation, a few lines of code are enough! Run the
following script ::

   from ars.app import Program

   class FallingBall(Program):

      def create_sim_objects(self):
         # add_sphere's arguments: radius, center, density
         self.sim.add_sphere(0.5, (1,10,1), density=1)

   if __name__ == '__main__':
      sim_program = FallingBall()
      sim_program.start()


..
   Old example
   ====================

..
   This is a tutorial introduction to quickly get you up and running with
   your own sphinx documentation system.  We'll cover installing sphinx,
   customizing the look and feel, using custom extensions for embedding
   plots, inheritance diagrams, syntax highlighted ipython sessions and
   more.  If you follow along the tutorial, you'll start with nothing and
   end up with this site -- it's the bootstrapping documentation tutorial
   that writes itself!

Official website
====================
ARS is hosted at `BitBucket <https://bitbucket.org/glarrain/ars>`_ where you
will find the `downloads <https://bitbucket.org/glarrain/ars/downloads>`_,
`source code <https://bitbucket.org/glarrain/ars/src>`_
and `issue tracker <https://bitbucket.org/glarrain/ars/issues>`_ sections.

Because ARS likes the Python community and the tools they use, it is
`registered in PyPI <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/ARS/>`_
(Python Package Index). Although useful for organizing packages, the
main benefit is to be able to install (and upgrade) using the ``pip`` program.
It takes just 3 words::

  pip install ARS

(well, you might have to prepend ``sudo`` in Linux if the current user doesn't
have the necessary permissions. Bummer, that's 4 words now...)

`Google group <http://groups.google.com/group/ars-robot-simulator>`_
