js.i18n
*******

Introduction
============

This library packages `i18n-js`_ for `fanstatic`_. It is aware of different modes (normal, minified).

.. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
.. _`i18n-js`: http://github.com/fnando/i18n-js/

This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
directory in ``js.i18n``) are published to some URL.

The package is maintained on `js.i18n`_ at `bitbucket.org`_.
