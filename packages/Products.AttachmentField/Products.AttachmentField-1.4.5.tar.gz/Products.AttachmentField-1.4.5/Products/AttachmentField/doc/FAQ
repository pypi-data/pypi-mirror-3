I did'nt find any additional content type with AttachmentField
    Of course, AttachmentField is a tool for Plone **developers** that
    helps building custom content types , and not for end users. THIS
    IS DEFINITELY NOT A BUG !!

Why would I use this product ?
    You need to use this product with any Archetype content if you want
    to have automatic content indexing and preview for your attachments
    (eg. PDF or MSWord files, ...).

Is it compatible with PloneArticle 2 or PloneExFile 2 ?
    No, it's not. With those products, you need to use ZAttachmentAttribute instead.
    AttachmentField is designed for PloneArticle 3 or PloneExFile 3.

I have a "IOError: [Errno 10] No child processes" when starting Zope with AttachmentField installed!
    That's a known issue with Zope < 2.7.4 under certain platforms (especially Linux). Upgrade Zope
    or use "$INSTANCE/bin/runzope" instead of "zopectl fw" to run Zope. It's a signal handling
    problem, which have been fixed in Zope 2.7.4.

Can I use PortalTransform instead of your module?
    Now with 1.3 version there's a link with PortalTransforms... PortalTransformAttachment is a fallback
    to PortalTransform when there's no dedicated plugin in AttachmentField.

Can I convert OpenOffice documents?
    Yes, you can, starting from AttachmentField 1.3. Just install CMFOODocument 0.3 (available at
    http://longsleep.org/projects/cmfoodocument/). You don't need the content type, only the
    portal_transforms converters and the mimetypes_registry information from this product.
    Restart Plone, and you're done.
    Future AF releases will remove the CMFOODocument dependency by providing a dedicated plugin.

For some reason, MSWord indexing under windows doesn't work
    Make sure you have all the required dependencies under Windows.
    You can find them at http://sourceforge.net/projects/gnuwin32

How can I disable a particular indexer temporarily?
    If you need to disable a particular indexer for a while, just comment one of the import line
    at the end of the __init__.py file.
    For example, if you need to perform a batch treatment on all your PloneArticle content,
    but without re-indexing each article each time, you can stop Zope, comment some indexers,
    restart Zope, run your batch, stop Zope, uncomment the indexers, restart Zope and perform
    an 'update catalog' operation on portal_catalog.

My server is complaining about a missing "cygwin1.dll" shared library.
	Since version 1.3.12, AtachmentField is bundled with the 1.5.9 cygwin1.dll.
 	* This is not the latest one! * This is the right version for this version
 	of unrtf.
	This library is placed in the converters/RTF/win32 directory of the product.
	If this library is not found for another tool, you have to move this library
	in a global directory like C:\windows\

My server is complaining about a wrong versionned "cygwin1.dll" shared library.
	See question above.
