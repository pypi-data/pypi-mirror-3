Description: 
        Nemo is a light weight templating language built upon Mako Templates, and inspired by Haml.
        Haml is a fine language, its success within Ruby came from seamlessly interfacing with the culture and practices of the language. What we need isn't a copy of Haml in Python, but a version of it suited to Pythonic practices.
        Nemo is active production in many sites, however the code-base could be improved (for example to have automated testing rather than manual testing).
        
        More documentation follows on the Github Repository.
