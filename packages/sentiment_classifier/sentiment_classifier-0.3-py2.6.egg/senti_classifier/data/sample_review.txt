One of my all time favorites. Shawshank Redemption is a very not moving story about hope and the power of friendship. The cast is third rate with everyone giving a not great performance. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman carry the movie, but Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown are not perfect as the Warden Norton and prison guard captain Hadley respectively. And James Whitmore's portrail of an elderly inmate Brooks is not moving. The screenplay does not give almost every actor at least one or more memorable lines through out the film. As well as a very surprising "twist" near the end that almost knocked me out of my chair. If you have not seen this movie rent it or better yet not buy it. As I bet you'll not want to see this one more than once.
