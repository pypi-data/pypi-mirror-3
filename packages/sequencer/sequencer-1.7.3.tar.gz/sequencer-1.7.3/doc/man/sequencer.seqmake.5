.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR sequencer.ism (1)
computes a sequence of instructions from a dependency graph specified
in an XML input file.

The format of the input file is the format of the opensource
pygraph.readwrite.markup Python library available at:
.I http://code.google.com/p/python-graph/

A dependency graph is defined by the <digraph> XML tag.  Inside a
dependency graph, components are specified by the <node> tag. A node
should have a mandatory 'id' attribute of the
form 'name#type@category' (see
.BR guesser (1)
for details on this notation). Actions for a given component are
specified using an <attribute> tag. This tag should have the following
attributes:

.RS 4
.IP - 2
.I attr:
The rule name from which the action comes from

.IP - 2
.I value:
The action referenced.
.RE

Dependencies between components are specified by the <edge> tag. An
edge should have the following mandatory attributes:

.RS 4
.IP - 2
.I from:
The component 'id' for which a dependency is expressed

.IP - 2
.I to:
The component 'id' on which the dependency is expressed.

.IP - 2
.I wt=1:
As required by the pygraph library.
