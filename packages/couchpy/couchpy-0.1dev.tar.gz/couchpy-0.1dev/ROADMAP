h3. Roadmap

A list of proposed features, change-requests, improvements and discrepancies
(in existing implementation)  collected from several sources.

h4. Tool

* Composing HTTP headers for request is very primitive, use MultiDict or
  something similar to HTTPMessage (used for response header) to make it more
  developer friendly.
* Proposed features,
  ** rewrites
  ** replication
  ** filters
  ** updates
  ** validate_doc_update
  ** show
  ** list
  ** database events
* ''Idea from query_couchdb'', Its goal is to clone the Google App Engine
  query API. Given a (valid) query, it determines the appropriate map/reduce
  and _view query to get that result. If the map/reduce is not there
  (HTTP 404), then it will update the design doc and re-query.

h4. Database

* _ensure_full_commit is returning status as 201 (CREATED) as apposed to 200
  (OK), check up with the developers on this.
* Complete the _missing_revs, _revs_diff, _all_docs, _temp_view methods of
  couchpy.database:Database class
* \__len\__ access for Database instance. Optimize it using a view-reduce
  function.
* Add support for _changes API's 'longpoll' and 'continuous' modes.
* Log messages
    How to iterate over all the log messages using _log API ?

h4. Documents

* \__len\__ access for Document instance. Optimize it using a view-reduce function.
* How to re-create a deleted document ?
* .attach() method uses `_attachments` property of the document to add
  attachments. For some reason this one fails at the server with message, <br>
  [<PRE
    ServerError:
    (500, (u'doc_validation', u'Bad special document member: _attachments'))
  >]
  Is this supported in 1.0.1 version ?
* For local document copy, source document revision is not being accepted !!
