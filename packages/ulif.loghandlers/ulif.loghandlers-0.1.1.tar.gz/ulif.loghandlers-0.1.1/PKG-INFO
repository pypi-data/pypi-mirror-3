Description: 
        This package provides additional loghandlers for use with the Python
        standardlib `logging` module.
        
        Currently, only one additional logging handler is provided, which
        manages log file rotation based on Cron-like settings. So you can tell
        to rotate the logs at every day, week, month, or similar. Different to
        the `logging.handlers.TimedRotatingFileHandler` you can expect the
        rotation to happen at beginning of intervals.
        
        For instance, if you start daily logging with
        `logging.handlers.TimedRotatingFileHandler` at 11:12h, a rollover will
        happen at 11:12h on the next day. With
        `ulif.loghandlers.DatedRotatingFileHandler` the rollover will instead
        happen at midnight, regardless of when you started the logging.
        
        Furthermore you can let the number of backup files increase
        indefinitely by passing *backupCount* = -1.
        
        Please note, that this package is still in a very early state and
        changes, also to the API, are likely to happen in near future.

        .. note:: Python2.6, 2.7 only!
        
          The package is currently usable with Python 2.6 and 2.7 only! Please
          drop me a line if you need it for other versions.
