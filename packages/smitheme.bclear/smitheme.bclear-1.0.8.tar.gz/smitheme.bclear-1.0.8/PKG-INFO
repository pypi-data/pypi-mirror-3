Description: Introduction for smitheme.bclear
        ================================
        
        This package defines Bethel Universities custom theme for Silva 2.3's Silva
        Management Interface.  This theme will not work for Silva 3.0+, and likely will
        not work for 2.2 and lower.
        
        This is a blue, airy theme giving more space around elements.  Some elements
        are repositioned or removed/hidden. 
        
        Breadcrumb Nav
        --------------
        
        The breadcrumb is now the primary means of navigation.  The up arrows next to
        each tab have been removed, since our experience showed that authors didn't
        know how to use them.  
        
        Between each breadcrumb item is an arrow -- clicking the arrow will display
        all of the tabs for the next item in the crumb.
