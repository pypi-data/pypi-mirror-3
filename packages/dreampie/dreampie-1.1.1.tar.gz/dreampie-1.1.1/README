This is DreamPie - The Python shell you've always dreamed about!

Homepage: http://dreampie.sourceforge.net/

Requirements: Python 2.5/2.6, PyGTK

DreamPie can also use Python 3.1 and Jython 1.5 as interpreters, but it requires
Python 2.5/2.6 in order to run the main process (There's no PyGTK on those
interpreters.) To run Python 3.1 you'll need Python 2.6, since lib2to3
(available only in 2.6) is needed.

If you have those, you simply run ./dreampie or ./dreampie.py from the source
directory.
To use another interpreter, run something like ./dreampie jython

A general-purpose python install:
* python setup.py install

To build the windows installer:
You will need Python 2.6, as pygtk for 2.7 isn't available yet.
Make sure you have comtypes, for create-shortcuts.
Get it from http://sourceforge.net/projects/comtypes/files/
* Remove the 'dist' directory
* Make sure setup.nsi has the correct version number
* \python26\python.exe setup.py py2exe -d windist
* Copy pygtk-2.6, gtk-runtime directories from a previous installation into
  the main directory (near setup.nsi).
* Compile setup.nsi
  (You will need NSIS, and the ShellLink plugin from
   http://nsis.sourceforge.net/ShellLink_plug-in)

To build the debian package: (The version numbers are just to give you an idea)
* python2.6 setup.py sdist
* mkdir packaging
* cd packaging
* cp ../dist/dreampie-0.9.tar.gz dreampie_0.9.orig.tar.gz
* tar -xvzf dreampie_0.9.orig.tar.gz
* Copy the 'debian' directory from the previous package into dreampie-0.9
* cd dreampie-0.9/debian
* dch -i (update version number, write something like "update to upstream")
* cd ..
* To create a source package:
    debuild -S
  To create a binary package:
    dpkg-buildpackage (Add -us -uc if you don't have a private key set up)
