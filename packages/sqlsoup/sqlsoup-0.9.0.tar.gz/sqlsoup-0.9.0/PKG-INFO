Description: =======
        SQLSoup
        =======
        
        SQLSoup provides a convenient way to map Python objects
        to relational database tables, with no declarative code
        of any kind.   It's built on top of the 
        `SQLAlchemy <http://www.sqlalchemy.org>`_ ORM and provides a
        super-minimalistic interface to an existing database.
        
        Usage is as simple as::
        
            import sqlsoup
            db = sqlsoup.SQLSoup("postgresql://scott:tiger@localhost/test")
        
            for user in db.users:
                print "user:", user.name
        
            db.users.filter_by(name="ed").update({"name":"jack"})
            db.commit()
        
        Included for many years as an extension to SQLAlchemy itself, SQLSoup 
        has been broken out into it's own project as of 2012.   The community is encouraged
        to collaborate on Bitbucket with patches and features.
