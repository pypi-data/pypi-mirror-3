Description: Overview
        ========
        
        This package provides an queryparser, querybuilder and extra helper tools,
        to parse stored queries to actual results, used in new style collections.
        It includes a registry reader which reads operators, values and criteria
        from the Plone registry.

        =========
        
        1.0.2 (2012-02-10)
        ------------------
        
        * Change the Creator field to use the correct query operation for filtering
          on the current logged in user.
          This fixes https://dev.plone.org/ticket/12052

        * Limit number of items that show up in the preview of the edit view to 25.
          If we do not limit these results all items in the query will be rendered in
          the preview which leads to problems when the collection contains > 10k
          results.
