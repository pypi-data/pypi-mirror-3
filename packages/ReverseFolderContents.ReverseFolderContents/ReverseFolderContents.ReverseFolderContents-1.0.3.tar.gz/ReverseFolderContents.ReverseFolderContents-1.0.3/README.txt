Introduction
============

This product started out as a way to monkeypatch plone so that the
folder contents was reversed, so it was called ReverseFolderContents.

However, it was soon found that reversing the navigation was necessary
as well, and a logical part of how people relate to a folder.

So here you go, have fun.

Any questions, send an email to info@nidelven-it.no :)

The code in getFolderContents.py is copied from Products.CMFPlone and
is under the GPL, slightly modified (a few lines added) to work with
this product.

To the best of my knowledge, the rest of this source code doesn't
contain any verbatim copies of code except for maybe some import
statements which can't be written in many different useful ways so the
thing is available as GPL version 2.  But thanks to all the people who
ask questions and figure things out and put it out on the web where it
can be found through search engines.
