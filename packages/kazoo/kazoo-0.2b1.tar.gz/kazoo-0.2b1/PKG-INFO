        -----------------
        
        Bug Handling
        ************
        
        - ZOOKEEPER-1318: SystemError is caught and rethrown as the proper invalid
          state exception in older zookeeper python bindings where this issue is still
          valid.
        - ZOOKEEPER-1431: Install the latest zc-zookeeper-static library or use the
          packaged ubuntu one for ubuntu 12.04 or later.
        - ZOOKEEPER-553: State handling isn't checked via this method, we track it in
          a simpler manner with the watcher to ensure we know the right state.
        
        Features
        ********
        
        - Exponential backoff with jitter for retrying commands.
