        anonymiseip anonymises IPv4 addresses using the MaxMind GeoIP database. Source
        addresses are mapped to country level, then assigned a different address from
        within that pool. To avoid known address back-mapping, the source address is
        hashed, and the hash taken mod pool-size to pick the new address. As IPv4
        address space is very small, this is still vulnerable to brute forcing - its
        feasible to generate every single mapping, and if a single mapping is found it
        would be possible to cater for salted hashes as well. As such, this is not
        suitable for protecting against malicious attacks, it is however suitable to
        use when ensuring employees do not have casual access to the IP address from
        weblogs, which count as personally identifying information, while still
        giving employees access to the same logs so they can look at usage patterns
        and troubleshoot slow requests etc.
        
        To anonymise an IPv4 address, perform a GET to /ipv4/x.y.z.a, the response
        will be a 200 OK + the new ip address, or a 5xx error.
        
        Dependencies
        ============
        
        * Python 2.6+
        
        * Maxmind GeoIP Python library and a country level database.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Run python -m anonymiseip.main in an environment with all the dependencies
        available. Alternatively run ./bootstrap.py to create bin/buildout, then
        bin/buildout to create a bin/py and finally bin/py -m gpverify.main.
        
        Note that the GeoIP Python library and database may have to be installed by
        hand. On Ubuntu systems they are available in the python-geoip and
        geoip-database packages respectively. Anonymiseip looks for the database in
        '/usr/share/GeoIP/GeoIP.dat'.
        
        Testing
        =======
        
        anonymiseip is stateless and fast, so just use it directly for testing.
        
        Pass --host 0.0.0.0 --port 0 will cause a port to be dynamically allocated and
        printed out, which your test driver can then use.
