NikePlus API
============

As a Nike+ user and software engeneer I thought it would be interesting to be
able to get the raw data of my runs. This little bit of software enables you to
fetch that data either in XML (as provided by Nike) or in JSON.

All you need is you UserID, which you can get by following those steps:

1. Sign in to NikePlus_.
2. Click *My Runs*.
3. Click the *Share* button on the top right of your runs.
4. Click *Add to a Web page*.
5. Click *Grab the Code*.

The Code is now copied to your clipboard. Inside that code, you can find your
UserID.
