Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This package integrates `JSHint`_ with Python's `unittest`_ module. This
        package was inspired by `gocept.jslint`_.
        
        `JSHint`_ is a community-driven tool to detect errors and potential problems in
        JavaScript code and to enforce your team's coding conventions.
        
        It provides a special JSHintTestCase class that collects JavaScript files (in
        a configurable manner) and dynamically generates a test method for each file
        that calls jslint on that file.

        Usage
        =====
        
        To use it, create a test class like this::
        
            class MyPackageJSLintTest(unittest_jshint.JSHintTestCase):
        
                include = (
                    'my.package.browser:js',
                    'my.package.browser:js/lib',
                    )
        
                options = ( 'curly', 'eqeqeq', )
        
        
        ``include`` is a list of "resource paths" of the form ``packagename:path``
        (passed to pkg_resources).
        
        ``exclude`` can be a list of filenames (without path) that will not be
        collected.
        
        ``options`` is a list of arguments that are passed to JSHint (see its
        `documentation`_ for details). The default value is::
        
            options = ()
        
        
        All files ending in ``.js`` contained in each of these paths will be collected,
        and the test class will grow a method named ``test_<filename>.js``.
        
        You can ignore JSHint error by setting ``ignore`` on the test class (a list of
        substrings that are matched against each JHLint output line)::
        
            ignore = (
                "Use a named parameter",
                )
        
        
        Requirements
        ============
        
        ``unittest_jshint`` was tested with:
        
        - Python 2.6 (unittest2 required)
        - Python 2.7
        
        Currently I only test with `Python`_ versions that are used by `Plone`_ so it
        just might work for other `Python`_ versions.
        
        ``unittest_jshint`` requires ``jshint`` to be in the ``PATH`` or providing
        customized environmental variable ``UNITTEST_JSHINT_COMMAND``.
