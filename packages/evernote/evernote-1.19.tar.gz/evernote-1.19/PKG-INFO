Description: Python bindings to the Evernote API.
        
        All the code comes direct from Evernote -- see
        http://www.evernote.com/about/developer/api/ -- and is owned by them.
        
        This is simply an unofficial package produced from that code and uploaded to
        PyPI. Questions about using the Evernote APIs should go to them;
        questions/problems about the packaging should go to me.
        
        My additions -- the setup.py, the fabfile to automate production of the package,
        this readme -- are BSD licensed; see LICENSE.txt.
