Jasy - Web Tooling Framework
============================

Jasy is a powerful Python3-based tooling framework. It makes it easy to manage heavy web projects with a strong JavaScript focus. Jasy is based on the mature JavaScript parser Narcissus (Spidermonkey) by Mozilla. The main goal of Jasy is to offer an API which could be used by developers to write their custom build/deployment scripts. Your build script is just a normal Python script which includes the Jasy-API and defines so-called tasks.

Jasy is licensed under Apache V2. See separate license file for details. The parser implementation is under a triple open source license MPL 1.1/GPL 2.0/LGPL 2.1 as these are from the original Spidermonkey code.

Jasy is listed on PyPI as well: http://pypi.python.org/pypi?:action=display&name=jasy
