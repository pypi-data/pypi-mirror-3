        ============
        
        This package contains A115's collection of clean and useful utilities for 
        mathematical manipulations. These utilities have been tried and tested in 
        multiple real world deployments and have proven useful in just many projects 
        where work with numbers or basic financial operations are required. 
        
        The best way to learn about the provided utilities is to look at the 
        nicely commented source code and the comprehensive suite of unit tests. 
        
        This package is used as one of several basic building blocks in multiple 
        other Python packages released as open-source by A115.  
        
        Python 2.7 is required.
