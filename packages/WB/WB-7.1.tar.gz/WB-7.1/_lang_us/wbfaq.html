[Q] What's the meaning of error: 
    Error:  [exceptions.IOError] file locking: /path/to/my/billboard/wb.lock
    (usually on a newly created billboard)

[A] It is not possible to write the lock file. The user ID under which your Web server
    runs must have write access to directory: /path/to/my/billboard.

    You must set that user ID as owner of the directory: see step 3 in<a href=install.html>installation</a>.

[Q] What's the meaning of error: 
    Billboard currently locked by "some user"?

[A] Some user is apparently currently modifying or adding a document to the billboard;
    this may happen when somebody suspends the update prior of publishing the document.
    A suspended session will remain hanging for some time (default expire time is one hour), 
    but you may force the expiration by doing a billboard maintenance. Be careful because
    this will forcefully terminate any current session

[Q] What's the meaning of error: 
    Session time expired

[A] While modifying or adding a document you went for a coffee without publishing the 
    document and came back too late: your modification has been lost.
