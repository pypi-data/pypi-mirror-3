Description: IterDicts are almost exactly like regular Python dicts, except that they're
        only populated upon demand. This gives them most of the same advantages of
        generators, such as the ability to operator on very large (or infinite!)
        datasets. For example:
        
        Accessing keys that aren't populated yet
        
        >>> d = IterDict((a, a) for a in xrange(1000000000000000))  # 1 quadrillion (US)
        >>> d[10]
        10
        
        Deleting keys that aren't populated yet
        
        >>> del d[20]
        >>> del d[20]
        KeyError: 20
