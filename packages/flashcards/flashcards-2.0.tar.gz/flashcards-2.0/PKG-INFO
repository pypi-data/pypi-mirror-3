        Flashcards is meant to be used as an installed python module.
        
        You're supposed to use it by opening the python shell and importing 'fla
        shcards'. It's designed to be used after setup.py install. It will store
        quizzes in the current directory (default is home directory).
        
        Flashcards has three components:
        
        quiz.py - data.csv - __main__.py
        
        
        ========================================================================
        INSTALLATION
        ========================================================================
        Use:
            python setup.py install
        That should do the trick.
        
        
        ========================================================================
        GENERAL USAGE
        ========================================================================
        NOTE:
        importing flashcards creates a data.csv file in the current working directory.
        flashcards uses this file to store flashcard information.
        flashcards may truncate the existing data.py, so be careful with your quizzes.
        
        If installed:
            in the python shell:
                import flashcards
                #That should activate the menu UI
            
        If not installed:
            Run __main__.py in flashcards/flashcards
        
        ALSO:
        
        For changes to take effect when editing data.py, you need to exit the program and re-enter.
        ========================================================================
        1)quiz.py
        
            This is the main script. It has two classes:
            
            A) reader - class
            This class parses the information from the data.csv and uses it to quiz 
            the user on it.
            
            B)writer - class
            This class collects the questions and answers from the user and stores them
            in the data.csv file for the reader class to use later.
            
        2)data.csv (data.|C|omma|S|eparated|V|alues)
        
            This is the data file where all of the flashcard information is stored.
            You can add information to it yourself, or you can use quiz.writer()
            
            Each line in this file contains a question and it's corresponding answer/s.
            
            Each value in each line is separated by a comma, so be carefull with questions
            and answers that have commas in them.
            
            The first value in the line is always the question, and whatever values that follow
            in that line are the various possible answers.
            
            Make sure there are no blank lines. Remember that spacing counts.
            "answer" is not the same as " answer"
            
        
        3) __main__.py
        
            Just a menu interface for user convenience, it makes use of all the scripts in the package.
            It also includes a delete function, which erases the contents of the data.csv file
            in the current working directory.
