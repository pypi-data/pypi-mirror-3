**safe** - spatial analysis functional engine
=============================================

Python based toolkit to implement spatial analysis that involve raster and vector data.

It was built because we did not want to worry about the differences between osgeo.gdal and osgeo.ogr, or WCS and WFS.

This is the result of mixing mathematicians and engineers and tasking them to create simulations to prepare for natural hazards with very short deadlines.

Features
========

 * Unified API to work with Raster and Vector objects.
 * Uses GDAL/OGR and Numpy in the backend.
 * Simple plugin module for creating your own functions and registering them in the engine.
 * Built-in interpolation operations for most common needs (Raster - Raster, Raster - Point, Raster - Polygon )
 * Autodiscovery of compatible functions based on layer metadata.
 * Support for output styles (SLD - OGC Styled Layer Descriptors).
 * Able to use layers from remote OGC compatible web services (WFS / WCS) (not implemented)
 * Designed to be easy to implement within QGIS and GeoNode.

Installation
============

#. Install dependencies
   
   You will need ``NumPy``, ``Nose`` and ``GDAL``.

   In Ubuntu, you can do it like this::

    sudo apt-get install python-numpy python-gdal python-nose

    

#. Install this package::

    pip install python-safe

   If you do not have ``pip`` installed but only ``easy_install``,
   you can do ``easy_install pip`` and then use it to install ``python-safe``.

#. To verify everything is working as it should do, open a python shell and do::

    import safe
    safe.test()

   You can pass additional parameters to the test function, for example: ``verbose=2``
   to view the test names.


For Developers
==============

   The source code and issue tracker can be found at http://github.com/AIFDR/python-safe

   To install a development version instead of the last release you can do::

    pip install -e git+git://github.com/AIFDR/python-safe.git#egg=python-safe

   Or use the old fashioned::

    git clone git://github.com/AIFDR/python-safe.git
    cd python-safe
    python setup.py install
