Description: termine is a commandline tool that makes it easy to connect to
        your SOAP enabled Groupwise (r) server (using suds) and to fetch your upcoming appointments.
        For example, to list your appointments for the current week, you would use:
        
        	termine list thisweek
        
        and to list your appointments for the current month you would use:
        
        	termine list thismonth
        
        Support for busy searching Groupwise (r) users is present but it is quite rudimentary at the
        moment. It is expected that this will be much more visible and usable in future versions.
