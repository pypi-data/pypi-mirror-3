Description: The *sequencer* is an engine used by system administrators for the
        computation and execution of sequences of actions over hardware or
        software (for example powering on/off a whole cluster or a data-
        center).
        
        The sequencer is made of three different stages for:
        
            * the computation of dependency graphs;
            * the computation of instructions sequences;
            * the execution of instructions sequences.
        
        Each stage can be called separately (in an incremental execution
        mode), or chained together (blackbox execution mode). Both modes have
        their use in real life. Incremental mode allows the end user to
        validate dependency graph and/or instructions sequence before putting
        it on production for its actual execution. This is done for an
        Emergency PowerOff (EPO) instructions sequence for example. The
        blackbox mode is used for simple usage such as powering on/off small
        subset of clusters or data centers.
