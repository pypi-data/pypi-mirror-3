ObjP's goal is to create a two-way bridge between Python and Objective-C. Unlike PyObjC, which uses
dynamic calls to methods on runtime, ObjP generates static code. It generates either Objective-C
interfaces to Python code or Python modules to interface Objective-C code.

At the moment, the library is exceedingly rudimentary, but it works for simple cases. One of these
cases is in demos/simple. To build and run this demo do (Python 3.2+ required)::

    $ ./waf configure build
    $ cd build
    $ ./HelloWorld

That programs calls a simple Python script from Objective-C, and that python script itself calls
an Objective-C class.
