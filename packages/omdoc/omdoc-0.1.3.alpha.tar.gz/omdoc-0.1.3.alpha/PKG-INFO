Description: ## OMDOC
        
        OMDOC is a lightweight documentation builder that utilises [jinja2][0] templates as placeholders for markdown and code.
        
        Code samples are parsed with [pygments][1] and the content is parsed with markdown.
        
        You're in total control of how it looks, feels and responds to different devices.
        
        No magic, it's plain ol' html with a dash of jinja, markdown and pygments. 
        
        ## Features
        
        ### code
        
        Any blocks of code inside code tags are parsed; eg
        
        ```<code lang="bash">
        pip install omdoc
        </code>```
        
        
        An attempt is made to match the lang attribute against [known pygments lexers][2]. If no match is found it defaults to python.
        
        ### Markdown 
        
        Any content inside of ...
        
        ```{% markdown %} stuff to mark down  {% endmarkdown%} ```
        
        ... gets marked down.
        
        
        
        ## Installation
        
        ```pip install omdoc```
        
        ## Usage
        
        1. Make folder for docs
        2. Create layout.html inside of docs folder
        2. Style as you see fit
        3. Create pages that inherit layout.html in docs
        5. cd 'docs'
        6. run ``omdoc``
        
        Your documentation will now be in <docs>/_build
        
        ## What about static media?
        
        Proceed as you would building a a normal site. Folders inside of `docs/` get copied into the final build. Just make sure to use relative paths in your html & css.
        
        
        ## Status
        
        Early alpha. 
        
        ## Known caveats
        
        ### Nested Folders
        
        Doesn't support nested folders for docs so `docs/about/this.html` doesn't work. This will get fixed later one
