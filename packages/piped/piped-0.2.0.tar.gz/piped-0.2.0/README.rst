Piped: a pipeline processing framework
======================================

Piped is a `MIT-licensed <https://github.com/foundit/Piped/blob/develop/LICENSE>`_ framework for
`flow based programming <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow-based_programming>`_ written in Python that focuses on:

* Ease of use.
* Extendability.
* Painless integrating with other systems.
* Testing and maintainability.
* Performance.


A base Piped installation already speaks multiple protocols, such as HTTP, SMTP and Perspective Broker. Contrib packages that extends Piped,
adding support for database connectivity, message queues such as `ZeroMQ <http://zeromq.org>`_ and more are also available.
