Description:       A SQLAlchemy dialect that can be used to read OpenEdge 10 (aka
              Progress) databases over ODBC.
        
              This dialect was written to do some simple reporting only. It has
              not been tested with write operations.
        
              The Progress ODBC drivers come from DataDirect and return UTF-8
              by default or UCS-2. To work properly with these drivers, pyodbc
              needs to be compiled with the -fshort-wchar option and a small
              patch (included in the source distribution) that asks the DataDirect
              ODBC driver for UCS-2.
