* Docs, docs, docs!

* Plugins for more markup languages, e.g. rST, textile

* Wider platform and Python support. The initial build and testing was done
  using python2.7 on Archlinux x86_64. Haven't tested on other Python versions
  and/or other platforms yet. Should also check on Python 3.

* Add more built-in engines, e.g. to generate photo galleries

* Improve the extras: better bash completion script, better demo project

* Higher test coverage

* ???
