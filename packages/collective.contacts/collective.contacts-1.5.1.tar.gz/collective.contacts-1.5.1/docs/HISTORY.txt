1.4.0
-----

  * Added a customize view so it's possible to select which columns are shown
    or not.

  * Removed the "Import organizations or persons" from the groups view, since
    it was misleading.

    created before this version.

  * Added sizes to the photo field for persons, and an update step that will
    handle the existing objects that were created before this version.

1.3.3
-----

  * Added the sub-sector field to the columns in the organizations view.

  * Did some rework on the advanced search templates (for persons and
    organizations).

  * Fixed the referencebrowser_popup template that wasn't showing content when
    re-editing a person or a group.

  * Fixed bug where drop down fields will not update their content when editing
    inline.

  * Fixed a typo in spanish translation ("Eportar" instead of "Exportar").

  * Added a css to override Plone's default behaviour when editing a drop down
    field inline (it repeats the field label).

1.3.2
-----

  * Included a custom referencobrowser_popup to show only objects that are
    allowed to be referenced inside the reference browser pop up.
    (Used when relating a person with an organization for example).

1.3.1
-----

  * Fixed display issues with rich text fields.

  * Added sector and subsector drop downs to the advanced organizations search.

  * Added a "Go back" link, when doing a quick search.

  * [FIXED] was using the same id for translating both work and personal email
    in the search for persons template.

  * Replaced the way content was retrieved for the views. Now it uses the
    catalog and, in the case of the persons, it uses the advanced query
    capabilities so it will sort using last name first and then first name.

  * Added 2 sortable fields to the catalog, one for the last name and the other
    for the first name. They are added and indexed on installation.

  * Added types names translation to the old i18n (probably a Plone bug?).

1.3.0
-----

  * Did an override over the contentviews template to workaround a possible bug
    of Plone when having the default page as a portal_action.

  * Found a way to get the 'Work' schemata title to be translated to spanish.

  * Added some classes to the views, so forms and buttons are hidden when
    printing.

  * Added the "Select all" checkbox to all tables.

  * Added an uninstall profile.

  * When a user has permission to view an address book, it will see the 3
    main tabs with the 3 main views.

  * Removed the border when inside a search or a search result. This "fixes"
    the issue where the wrong tab was selected when inside a search or search
    results.

  * Added checkboxes to send email and export inside a group view.

  * Fixed missing translations under the "Send emails page".

  * Added "go back" and "Advanced search" buttons properly when getting or not
    getting search results.

  * Finished with the country and states fields, added them to the search
    templates.

  * Fixed a typo with the email spanish translation.

  * Added a note when sending emails about opening the default email client.

1.2.0
-----

  * Added Sectors and Sub sectors drop downs to organizations, where you can
    select a "sector" and then the "sub sectors" are automatically updated
    using KSS (Same behaviour as countries and states). This sectors are
    loaded in the address book itself.

  * Replaced the Country and State text entries with a drop down for all
    countries and, using kss, a drop down with states for each country. This
    was mainly taken from GetPaid, so most of the credit goes for those great
    gentlemen.

  * Title for the group view page.

  * Moved some fields to the default schemata, so instead of a drop down, they
    are shown as tabs.

  * Replaced the advanced search link with buttons.

  * Fixed a bug with the advanced search. Was giving some errors when searching
    persons based on their organization.

  * The import script now imports persons even if they had no organization.

  * Quick search feature can now return results if part of a string was
    entered. And if several words are used, it does an OR of all of them.

  * Added "No results found" string when no results are found, instead of
    showing an empty table.

  * Removed all required fields, only Name and Last name are required for
    persons, and just the name for organizations.

  * If persons or organizations have no email set, then the checkbox for
    sending them an email is disabled. Same if a group has no members, or
    members with no email.
