Description: Warning: This product is highly experimental, and created without deep
        knowledge/experience of the marker interfaces or ZODB machinery.  It
        may start making modifications deep within the ZODB and interface
        machinery as soon as it is loaded.
        
        It's main purpose is being installed and run on an instance that has
        old, broken marker interface dependencies and being used to find and
        clear those dependencies.  In particular this product was built to
        remove p4a (Plone 4 Artists) cruft when upgrading from Plone 3 to
        Plone 4.  It should be noted that product has its own uninstallation
        procedure.
        
        Portions copied from ZODB and zope.interface (under the ZPL).  The
        rest is available under the GPL.

               - Fixing some bugs in extensions.
        
        1.0.2a (2012-02-15)
        
              - Re-enabled patching of ZODB/serialize to enable migrating
                Plone site without upgrade stopping on missing interfaces
        
              - Refactored the code a bit, adding more robustness to the
                hacked _dump method.
