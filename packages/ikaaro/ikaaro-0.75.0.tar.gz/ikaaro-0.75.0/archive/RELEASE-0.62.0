ikaaro 0.62.0 (2010/08/10)
==========================

This is a Content Management System built on Python & itools, among
other features ikaaro provides:

 - content and document management (index&search, metadata, etc.)
 - multilingual user interfaces and content
 - high level modules: wiki, forum, tracker, etc.

Changes
-------

Maybe most important in this release is the new metadata: with a new
file format, new features and a somewhat different API.

Though the most visible change are the deep modifications to the main
template.  Which now can be customized through the control panel: to
change the logo, edit the CSS, etc.

Users can now define their timezone in the preferences form; information
that is used through ikaaro to properly display times.

Every existing submodule has seen major changes:

- The new Blog module replaces the Forum.

- Calendar: a completely new internal structure (now every event is
  stored as a separate resource), and better import/export logic.

- Tracker: the internals have been much simplified.

- The Wiki is not anymore included in ikaaro, it will be distributed as
  a separate package.

An important bug has been fixed, now the icms-update.py script does not
override anymore the modification time & last author of the upgraded
resources.

There are many other small feautures and user interface improvements
through ikaaro.  As well as some programming interface changes, like
the simpler API to make new resources (check the UPGRADE file).
