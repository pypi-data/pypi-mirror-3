    <h1>Hello Tornado</h1>
    <p>To get a feel for the different ways of interacting with Couch, let’s start with a Hello World. Here’s
       the boilerplate to set up a tornado server with two endpoints at <code>/hello</code> and <code>/hi</code>:</p>
    {{{app_boilerplate}}}
    
    <p>Since both of the request handlers (defined below) will need a reference to the database, set
       up a global for them to share:</p>
    {{{cords_boilerplate}}}
    
    <h2>The Twisted-Up Way</h2>
    <p>Our first request handler will parse the url and pull out the last component (which will 
       be treated as a document ID). It will then try to retrieve that doc from the database and print
       a greeting based on its contents. Here is a handler that uses an explicit callback to make a 
       non-blocking request:</p>
    {{{jumpy_app}}} 
    
    <p>Though it’s gratifying to know that your server process isn’t blocking while waiting for Couch to
       respond, the resulting code doesn’t feel terribly pythonic. Ideally something as simple as a GET
       request should be a one-liner. In addition, the use of callbacks means your code is no longer 
       in the call stack should an exception occur during the request. As a result, error handling becomes a 
       C-like process of manual <code>status</code> inspection in lieu of idiomatic <code>try</code>/<code>except</code>
       blocks.</p>
        
    <h2>The Way Out</h2>
    <p>A particularly nice solution to this problem of twisted async code is provided by the <a
       href="http://www.tornadoweb.org/documentation/gen.html"><code>tornado.gen</code></a> module. As the
       abbreviated name suggests, their approach is to use python <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0255/">generators</a> 
       to turn request handler methods into coroutines that can be suspended during i/o then restarted when 
       the response arrives.</p>
      
    <p>Corduroy is happy to work in this style and provides the <code>@relax</code> decorator to make
       the syntax more transparent (or at least more glazed with sugar). When applied to one of your
       methods, the decorator allows you to treat the API as if it were blocking and no longer requires
       explicit callbacks. All your code needs to do to make this possible is place a <code>yield</code>
       in front of calls to the library.</p>
       
    <p>The result of this <code>yield</code> expression will be the data that would ordinarily be passed to your
       callback function but can now be captured through simple assignment. If an error occurrs, the decorator
       handles that as well by raising the exception at the point of the <code>yield</code> in your code:</p>
    {{{relaxed_app}}}
    <p>This code <em>looks</em> like ‘normal’ blocking code but will in fact execute asynchronously. At the
       point of the <code>yield</code> statement, the request handler releases control of the event loop while
       Corduroy creates a callback behind the scenes. Once this internal callback fires, the request handler’s
       method is resumed. The handler can then make other asynchronous requests or just return its output if
       there’s nothing more to be done.</p>

    <a name="conventions"></a>
    <h1>Calling Conventions</h1>  
    <p>Virtually every method in Corduroy accepts an optional keyword argument called <code>callback</code>.
       When this argument is omitted (and the <code>@relax</code> decorator is not in effect), the call will 
       use blocking i/o and the function call will not return until the operation is complete (or until an exception is raised).</p>
    <p>If you pass a callable object (a.k.a. a function) as the callback arg, the call will complete almost
       immediately and the return value will not be the final data but a replica of the HTTP Request (which can be
       useful for debugging e.g., when passing a lot of options). The callback will be invoked moments later,
       when the server response arrives.
     </p>
    <p>Callbacks should expect two arguments and be of the form:</p>
    {{{example_callback}}}
      
    <h2>Callback Arguments</h2>
    <p>The first argument will contain the response from the server, either as a unicode string or as a 
       decoded json object. </p>
    <p>The second argument allows for error checking and has five attributes of 
       intrest: 
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>ok</code>: <code>False</code> if a response code >= 400 was received</li>
      <li><code>code</code>: The numeric HTTP response code</li>
      <li><code>headers</code>: A dictionary of response headers</li>
      <li><code>exception</code>: Either <code>None</code> or the exception that would have been raised
        were this a non-blocking call. Feel free to raise it yourself.</li>
      <li><code>error</code>: Either <code>None</code> or the class of the exception. This is redundant, 
        but also allows callback functions to use the syntax:<div class="sample"><pre><span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">status</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">error</span> <span class="ow">is</span> <span class="n">Conflict</span><span class="p">:</span></pre></div>
        which seems rather friendlier than:<div class="sample"><pre><span class="k">if</span> <span class="nb">isinstance</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">status</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">exception</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">Conflict</span><span class="p">):</span></pre></div>
       </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>When <code>status.ok</code> is <code>False</code>, the contents of the first argument are somewhat
       variable. Sometimes Couch responds verbosely to error conditions and the <code>data</code> argument will
       contain a json object. At other times <code>data</code> will simply be <code>None</code>. When in 
       doubt, consult the <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/couchdb/Complete_HTTP_API_Reference">HTTP API</a>.</p>
      
    <h2>Explicit vs. Implicit Callbacks</h2>
    <p>When you call the database from within a <code>@relax</code>-decorated function you don't have to 
       provide a callback; the decorator will do it for you. To give you some idea of what happens when you
       type <code>yield</code>, the decorator-provided callback’s logic looks something like this:</p>
       {{{relax_pseudocode}}}
       
    <p>The rest of this guide will use the implicit callback style for brevity’s sake. Just keep in mind that anywhere you
       see a <code>yield</code> before a library call, you could pass a <code>callback</code> argument
       instead.</p>
      
    <a name="couches-and-databases"></a>
    <h1>Couches &amp; Databases</h1>
    <p>When thought of purely as a key/value store, a CouchDB installation is a cascade of json objects with
       three basic levels of hierarchy. In Couch nomenclature, a single <em>Server</em> can contain many <em>Databases</em> 
       which in turn contain many <em>Documents</em>.</p>
    <h2>The CouchDB Server</h2>
    <p>Servers are represented by <code>Couch</code> objects. The constructor takes a url as an argument, 
      but will use the values in <code>corduroy.defaults</code> to construct a default url if none is provided.
      You can also include login credentials, either inline or as a 2-tuple.
      If you haven’t overridden the <code>host</code> and <code>port</code> defaults, all of these instantiations should be equivalent:</p>
      {{{couch_init}}}
    <p>All three of the above will return with:</p>
      {{#output}}<Couch 'http://127.0.0.1:5984'>{{/output}}
    <p>Creating a <code>Couch</code> object doesn’t actually connect to the server. As a result it’s safe to
       call the constructor in an event handler without needing a callback. You can then use the object’s 
       <code>all_dbs</code> method to obtain a list of available databases, monitor server activity with
       <code>tasks</code>, or read/write configuration options with <code>config</code>. See the Reference
       docs for other server-level operations.</p>
    <p>In all likelihood the only methods you’ll use regularly are <code>db</code> and <code>create</code>
       which let you retrieve a reference to a specifc database using its name:</p>
    {{{couch_interaction}}}
    <p>Since this pattern is fairly common, the above can be simplified to:</p>
    {{{couch_interaction_brief}}}

    <h2>Databases</h2>
    <p>You don’t actually need to create a <code>Couch</code> just to access a database. You can also
       instantiate them directly by passing the full url to the db to the <code>Database</code> constructor.
       As with <code>Couch</code> objects, the default server url will be prepended if necessary. Both of these
       are equivalent:</p>
    {{{db_init}}}
    {{#output}}<Database 'some_db_name'>{{/output}}
    <p>Creating a <code>Database</code> object doesn’t contact the server, but an efficient check for its
       presence can be performed by calling its <code>exists</code> method. Similarly useful is the 
       <code>info</code> method which performs a GET on the database’s root url.</p>

    <a name="documents"></a>
    <h1>Documents</h1>
    <p>CouchDB documents are dict-style json objects with two required keys: <code>_id</code> and <code>_rev</code>.
       The <code>_id</code> field is a unique-to-that-database string that allows the document to be requested
       by name. The <code>_rev</code> value is filled in by the server when you create or update a document. It
       is also the basis of Couch’s transaction-less mechanism for detecting write conflicts (see the <a href="eventual-consistency">Eventual Consistency</a>
       section for details).</p>
       
    <p>Corduroy will accept any <code>dict</code>-like you pass and treat it as a document. The objects it
       returns will by default use the <code>corduroy.Document</code> class (though this can be overridden). The
       <code>Document</code> class inherits from <code>dict</code> and has two noticeable differences from the
       stdlib model:</p>
       <ol>
         <li>It preserves the order of keys in dictionary objects (mimicing Erlang and Javascript behavior w/r/t
             json serialization)</li>
         <li>It allows you to refer to items in the dict as if they were attributes.</li>
       </ol>
    
    <h2>Basic CRUD</h2>
    <p>To fetch a single document, call the <code>Database</code> object’s <code>get</code> method with the 
       desired <code>_id</code> string. The <code>Document</code> object it returns can be used just like a dictionary:
    {{{doc_get}}}
    {{#output}}<Document lackey-129[1] {first:"Oliver", last:"Reeder", office:"Richmond Terrace"}>
Mr. Oliver Reeder can be found at Richmond Terrace.{{/output}}

    <p>After making local changes, a new version of the document can be written to the db by calling the
      <code>save</code> method:</p>
    {{{doc_save}}}
    {{#output}}<Document lackey-129[2] {first:"Oliver", last:"Reeder", education:"Oxbridge"}>{{/output}}
    <p>Note that the number in brackets incremented as a result of the save. This number is the first portion
       of the <code>_rev</code> value (the full value looks more like “<code>2-0348cd6cc49cb4cacdb9b94c87c83808</code>”).
       The <code>_rev</code> will change on every successful update. Also notice that we ignored the return value since the 
       <code>save</code> method updates its argument as a side effect.</p>
    <p>To remove a document from the db, pass a current version of the doc to the <code>delete</code> method. 
      If your argument’s <code>_rev</code> value doesn’t match the server copy, a conflict exception will 
      be raised.</p>
    {{{doc_delete}}}
    
    <p>To create a new document, <code>save</code> a dict with a valid <code>_id</code> string. Its <code>_rev</code>
      will be set in the process:</p>
    {{{doc_create}}}
    {{#output}}1-d0a259b5b8e71a3c0b0bc7facbb690d5{{/output}}
    <p>If you don’t specify an <code>_id</code>, one will be chosen for you. Corduroy keeps a cache of identifiers
       collected from the couch server’s <code>_uuids</code> API. Relying on server-provided IDs can 
       purportedly improve performance since the generated identifiers are semi-sequential in a way that
       is friendly to b-tree traversal. I take no definite stance on this.</p>
    {{{doc_create_anon}}}
    {{#output}}6efcdf33df6c82bfc53d7416c660ef5a 1-967a00dff5e02add41819138abb3284d{{/output}}
    
    <h2>Batch CRUD</h2>
    <p>Both the <code>get</code> and <code>save</code> methods can accept either a single value or a list
       as the first argument. To fetch multiple documents in a single request, pass a list of ID strings. The
       return value is a list of <code>Document</code> objects in the same order as the IDs list:</p>
    {{{batch_get}}}
    {{#output}}<Document ballentine[9] {first:"Claire", last:"Ballentine", highly_regarded:True}>{{/output}}
      
    <p>Whereas the single-doc <code>get</code> call will raise a <code>NotFound</code> exception should the 
       requested doc not exist, a batch <code>get</code> flags missing documents by including a <code>None</code> at the 
       corresponding element of the results list.</p>
       
    <p>To update multiple documents in a single request, pass your list of updated docs to <code>save</code>. To
       delete one or more docs in the batch, add a <code>_deleted</code> key to each such doc before submitting 
       the request:</p>
    {{{batch_save}}
    
    <a name="eventual-consistency"></a>
    <h1>Eventual Consistency</h1>
    <p>One of the fundamental differences between CouchDB and traditional RDBMSs is the way data integrity and
       transactional semantics are handled. The tl;dr version is that Couch abandons nearly all SQL-ish guarantees 
       and pushes responsibility for conflict resolution to the client. </p>
       
    <p>This might sound like a mis-feature, but in the best <a href="http://arborjs.org/docs/worse-is-better">Worse-is-Better</a> 
       tradition, the lack of abstraction over what-gets-written-when can force you to improve the way you
       structure your code. This may just be stockholm syndrome talking, but there’s an argument to be made that
       the client can do a better job of deciding how to deal with conflicts than a one-size-fits-all transaction
       could.</p>

    <h2>Couch’s Approach to MVCC</h2>

    <p>Regardless of how they’re rationalized, update conflicts are a common enough occurrance when dealing
       with documents that your code should generally consider them the norm rather than an exceptional
       condition.</p>
    
    <p>The basic rule Couch uses to determine whether an update should succeed is quite simple: </p>
    <blockquote>The new version of a doc must have the same <code>_rev</code> value as the copy currently 
      in the database.</blockquote>

    <p>To see how this on some level solves the entire problem of lost data consider the scenario where two
       clients simultaneously download the same copy of a doc whose revision is currently <code>1</code>. Both 
       clients will modify their local copy of the doc and attempt to save it back to the database.</p>
       
    <p>The first client to connect will succeed, since the <code>_rev</code> of its modified doc matches 
       the value in the database. The server’s copy of the doc is then updated and its <code>_rev</code> is
       incremented to <code>2</code>.</p>

    <p>When the second client’s save attempt is handled, the client’s <code>_rev</code> (<code>1</code>) no longer matches
       the server’s copy (now <code>2</code>). As a result the save will fail and raise a <code>Conflict</code>
       exception.</p>
         
    <p>The second client must now fetch the newly updated doc from the server, re-apply its modifications, then
       attempt the save again.</p>
        
    <h2>The Standard Recipe</h2>
    <p>The end result of this <code>_rev</code>-matching rule is that any writes attempted by your code should 
       use the following algorithm:</p>
       <ol>
        <li>Attempt the write.</li>
        <li>If no conflict occurred, you’re done.</li>
        <li>If there <em>was</em> a conflict, request the now-current copy of the doc.</li>
        <li>At the very least, copy the <code>_rev</code> from the newly-retrieved copy of the doc to
            your local copy. Ideally do something clever that merges the two docs without losing any edits.</li>
        <li>Attempt a write of the merged doc and <code>GOTO 2</code></li>
       </ol>

    <p>It’s worth acknowledging that doing things ‘correctly’ is a fair amount of (fairly repetitive) work. Thus the 
       temptation to perform blindfolded writes and just hope for the best can be dangerously strong.</p>
    
    <p>To try to make it easier to be responsible in this context, Corduroy treats every write as a potentially
       conflict-inducing operation. In previous examples of the <code>save</code> method, the return value was
       ignored. Let’s now take a look at the <code>ConflictResolution</code> object that <code>save</code> returns:
    {{{resolution_success}}}
    {{#output}}<Success: 2 docs updated>{{/output}}
    {{{resolution_conflicts}}}
    {{#output}}<Conflict: second>{{/output}}
    <p>From the repr strings you can see whether the write was successful and the list of conflicted IDs if not.
       To access this information from your code, the conflicts variable contains a pair of attributes to be
       inspected:</p>  
    <ul>
      <li><code>pending</code>: A dictionary (keyed by <code>_id</code>) containing a reference to each doc whose
          write attempt was unsuccessful.</li>
      <li><code>resolved</code>: A dictionary of all the successfully written docs.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Resolving Conflicts</h2>
    <p>You <em>could</em> use the values in <code>pending</code> to plan a fetch request, merge the results with your
       local edits, then resubmit them. But since this is such a common pattern, the <code>ConflictResolution</code>
       object provides a method called <code>resolve</code> to handle all of this in one shot.</p>
  
    <p>Since all parts of the Standard Recipe are identical except for step 4 (merging the local and fetched copies
       of the doc), Corduroy allows you to encapsulate your merge logic in a function and pass that to  
       <code>resolve</code> which will orchestrate the required HTTP traffic.</p>
    {{{resolution_merge}}}
    {{#output}}pre-merge:  1
post-merge: 0{{/output}}
    
    <p>The <code>ConflictsResolution</code> object fetches the current versions of all the <code>pending</code>
       docs, then repeatedly calls your merge function with local and remote copies of each. The merge function 
       should return a dictionary that merges the data in the divergent copies. These returned dictionaries will then
       be sent to the server in a batch write attempt. If the merge function returns <code>None</code>, no attempt to
       write that doc will be made.</p>
    <p>When the <code>resolve</code> call completes, the <code>pending</code> and <code>resolved</code> dictionaries
       will be updated to reflect the new state.</p>
    
    <h2>Anticipatory Conflict Handling</h2>
    <p>The same merge functions that that the <code>resolve</code> method accepts can also be passed to the 
       <code>Database.save</code> method directly. If any conflicts occur, a resolution will automatically be
       attempted using your merge function.</p>
    {{{resolution_before}}}
    <p>Despite this particular merge function’s obvious unsuitability for use in production, a forced overwrite is 
       ocasionally just the thing you need (especially during development). As a further shorthand, the above can be rewritten as:</p>
    {{{resolution_with_force}}}
    
    <a name="views"></a>
    <h1>Views</h1>
    <p>Beyond accessing documents individually, Couch provides a mechanism for building named indexes called
      ‘views’ that can aggregate data across documents. Views are defined by javascript functions on the server
      that update the index every time a document is added or modified. From the client’s perspective they are a
      series of ‘rows’ with three attributes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>key</code>: A string or other json-serializable object (often a list)</li>
        <li><code>id</code>: The <code>_id</code> of the document this row represents.</li>
        <li><code>value</code>: An arbitrary value returned by the serverside function.</li>
      </ul>
    <p>The mapping of rows to documents is not one-to-one, so it’s quite possible for one doc to be represented
       by multiple rows while another is omitted altogether.</p><p> Similarly, <code>key</code> values may be unique between rows but
       often will not be. In fact one of the more useful properties of views is that multiple documents can be 
       grouped together on the basis of having the same key.</p>
    
    <h2>Querying a View</h2>
    <p>To retrieve all of the rows from a view, call the database object’s <code>view</code> method with
       the ‘name’ of that view as an argument. Views are named according to the
       <a href="http://guide.couchdb.org/draft/design.html">design documents</a> they live in, so for a view 
       called <code>byname</code> in a design document called <code>_design/employees</code>, its ‘name’ 
       would be "<code>employees/byname</code>". </p>
    <p>The result of a call to <code>view</code> is an iterable list of <code>Row</code> objects. Here we
       grab all of the rows from a view and begin printing them out:</p>
    {{{query_simple}}}
    {{#output}}<employees/byname: 17/17 rows>{{/output}}
    {{{query_rowbits}}}
    {{#output}}key:abbott   | id:emp-2c9792a3
key:coverley | id:emp-fad5095d
key:cullen   | id:emp-687e8224
⋮
key:reeder   | id:emp-c110c0a8
{{/output}}
    
    <h2>Random Access Rows (and Docs)</h2>
    <p>Since every row in a view has an associated key, you can selectively query the view only for rows matching
       a particular value. For instance, to grab just the first row the query would be:</p>
    {{{query_hugh}}}
    <p>Queries with multiple keys are also possible:</p>
    {{{query_few}}}
    <p>Part of what makes this a useful feature is that the documents associated with rows can also be included
       in the response. As a result, views can be used to define aliases to documents independent of their potentially
       unwieldy <code>_id</code> values:</p>
    {{{query_hugh_further}}}   
    {{#output}}<Document emp-2c9792a3[5932] {first:"Hugh", last:"Abbott", locale:"Unknown"}>{{/output}}
    
    
    <h2>Ranged Queries</h2>
    <p>Since the rows in a view are sorted in ascending order based on their keys, you can also request all rows
       within a range by specifying <code>startkey</code> and <code>endkey</code> values. To select all the “C”
       names, the query wouldbe:</p>
    {{{query_c_words}}}
    {{#output}}[u"coverley", u"cullen"]{{/output}}
    <p>If it’s not immediately apparent why the above query looks the way it does I highly recommend the 
       CouchDB Guide’s <a href="http://guide.couchdb.org/draft/views.html">chapter</a> on the subject.</p>
    
    
    <h2>Reductions</h2>
    <p>For the most part views as described so far – an ordered set of key/id/value rows – provide all 
       the data-access flexibility you need for reading out the state of your database. But Couch also
       allows for a serverside pre-processing step to be associated with each view through the use of
       a <code>reduce</code> function.</p>

    <p>Couch’s semantics would seem to encourage using <code>reduce</code> as a 
       way to create denormalized copies of your view data (e.g., creating a list of all the values for
       a given key). But in practice this sort of usage is to be avoided due to an unfortunate trade-off 
       in Couch’s b-tree-based internal design.</p>
       
    <p>Instead, <code>reduce</code> should be thought of as a way to convert rows into a handful
       of numeric values – often only one. Accepting that limitation, it frequently makes sense to use one of
       Couch’s <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/couchdb/Built-In_Reduce_Functions">built-in</a> reductions 
       instead of writing your own. In combination with <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/couchdb/View_collation">View Collation</a> 
       this becomes a surprisingly powerful technique.</p>
    <p>Here is a view that uses the <code>_count</code> built-in reduction on rows keyed by the date.
       Views with <code>reduce</code> functions will return the output of that reduction by default. The
       pre-reduction rows can still be accessed with the query:
       </p>
    {{{query_no_reduce}}}
    {{#output}}["2007","11","28"]
["2007","11","29"]
["2007","11","29"]
⋮
["2007","12","02"]{{/output}}

    <p>The <code>group</code> and <code>group_level</code> keyword arguments allow you to control whether
       the <code>reduce</code> function is applied uniformly to the rows (resulting in a single value), 
       or to groupings based on shared key values.</p>
    {{{query_reduce}}}
    {{#output}}["2007","11","28"] → 1
["2007","11","29"] → 17
["2007","11","30"] → 3
["2007","12","01"] → 92
["2007","12","02"] → 50{{/output}}
    {{{query_reduce_group}}}
    {{#output}}["2007","11"] → 20
["2007","12"] → 142{{/output}}
    
    <a name="data-formatters"></a>
    <h1>Data Formatters</h1>
    <p>Couch is not limited to presenting your documents and views as json-formatted text. It allows you to
      define special handlers to transform the raw data into HTML, BibTeX, WAD or whatever is appropriate for 
      your application.</p>
    
    <p>These custom formatters are defined in a design document specific to your database and are referred to
      as ‘lists’ (which process the output of views) and ‘shows’ (which process the content of documents). Their client APIs are quite similar, 
      in both cases you provide the name of the formatter along with the view or document it will be applied to.
      In response an object is returned with two attributes of interest:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>headers</code>: A dictionary of response headers</li>
        <li><code>body</code>: A bytestring (or decoded json object if a mime-type of <code>application/json</code> was
          present in the headers)</li>
      </ul>
    
    <h2>Formatting Documents with Shows</h2>
    <p>‘Show’ functions are reuseable javascript routines that have access to a specified document as well
      as any query arguments passed in the request. Here the function <code>csv</code> in the design doc
      <code>records</code> is being used to format a document. The <code>include_titles</code> argument 
      instructs this particular ‘show’ to output a header row in addition to the document data:</p>
    {{{format_show}}}
    {{#output}}text/csv{{/output}}
    {{{format_show_more}}}
    {{#output}}artist,title,review,doc_id
Jeff Wayne,War of the Worlds,Stimulating,1978-wotw
    {{/output}}
    
    <h2>Formatting Views with Lists</h2>
    <p>‘List’ functions use similar syntax but apply to a view instead of a single document. In addition
       to query arguments, the same slicing operations that apply to views can be included to filter out
       selected rows before formatting:</p>
    {{{format_list}}}
    {{#output}}<ul><li>Nicola Murray</li><li>Newcastle</li><li>National Trust</li></ul>{{/output}}

    <p>If your list function is general enough, you can apply it to other views as well; even views
       in other design documents:</p>
    {{{format_list_elsewhere}}}
    {{#output}}<ul><li>Steve Fleming 13:00-13:07</li><li>Julius Nicholson 13:30–</li></ul>
{{/output}}



    <a name="replication"></a>
    <h1>Replication</h1>
    <p>Reliable, master-less <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/couchdb/Replication">replication</a> is one of Couch’s marquee features. A replication involves a source
       and a target database and propagates changes from the former to the latter. To copy an existing database, 
       pass the source and target database names (or urls) to a <code>Couch</code> object:</p>
    {{{replicate}}}
    
    <p><code>Database</code> objects can also replicate themselves through their <code>push</code> and <code>pull</code>
       methods. Their behavior is analogous to the eponymous commands used by distributed version control systems.
       These operations are one-way in nature meaning a full synchronization of two databases (each with local edits) 
       requires a reciprocal push and pull:</p>
    {{{replicate_push}}}

    <h2>Persistence</h2>
    <p>In addition to one-off, ‘anonymous’ replications, Couch maintains a system-controlled database called <code><a href="http://www.couchbase.com/docs/couchdb-release-1.1/index.html">_replicator</a></code>
       to track named replications over time. This database is exposed by the <code>Couch</code> object and behaves
       like any other (supporting <code>get</code>, <code>save</code>, and friends).</p>
    <p>The <code>_replicator</code> database has the special property that when docs of a certain form are created, 
       they will trigger a new replication. Its ongoing status can then be monitored by polling the document:</p>
    {{{replicator}}}
    {{#output}}{
  "_id":"local-to-remote",
  "source":"localdb", 
  "target":"http://elsewhere.com:5984/remotedb",
  "continuous":true,
  "_replication_id":  "c0ebe9256695ff083347cbf95f93e280",
  "_replication_state":  "triggered",
  "_replication_state_time":  1297974122
} {{/output}}

    <p>As a convenience, all of the replication methods accept a keyword argument called <code>_id</code>. If included,
       a new document will be created in the <code>_replicator</code> database using the arguments for its fields. 
       Thus the previous example could be rewritten as:</p>
    {{{replicator_convenience}}}
    <p>Or if you want to get fancy:</p>
    {{{replicator_star}}}
    
    <a name="change-notifications"></a>
    <h1>Change Notifications</h1>
    <p>At the filesystem level, a couch database is stored as something more akin to a journal file than a snapshot
       of the current state. Every document modification is appended to this journal and the ‘live’ database can be
       thought of as the result of playing back all these modification records in order.</p>
    <p>Beyond being just an implementational detail, this alternative method of representing a database (as a sequence
       of changesets) is exposed through the <code><a href="http://wiki.apache.org/couchdb/HTTP_database_API#Changes">_changes</a></code> 
       API. Your application code can make use of this data in two main ways:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>retrieving a list of changes since a known timepoint (a ‘seq’ value).</li>
      <li>subscribing to an asynchronous feed in which a user-provided callback is fired in realtime coincident with changes to the db.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The former can be useful for reinventing differently-sized wheels (see also <a href="#replication">Replication</a>), 
       while the latter can be used to trigger scripted events such as cache invalidation or summary statistics generation.</p>
    <p>When requesting a list of changes, you can either specify no arguments (in which case somewhere between 0 and <code>update_seq</code>
      change records will be returned), or you can bracket the time period in order to limit the response size:</p>
    {{{changes_seq}}}
    {{#output}}11519{{/output}}
    {{{changes_everything}}}
    {{#output}}seq: 11519 (210 changes){{/output}}
    <p></p>
    {{{changes_bracket}}}
    {{#output}}seq: 11506 (5 changes){{/output}}
    <p>Each element of the <code>changes.results</code> list corresponds to a document and contains a delta relative
       to its previous state. For all the details see the CouchDB Book’s <a href="http://guide.couchdb.org/draft/notifications.html#polling">chapter</a> on the subject.</p>
    
    
    <h2>Asynchronous Feeds</h2>
    <p>Changes can also be accessed as a ‘feed’ in which an HTTP connection is left open and Couch will write 
       individual change notifications to it as they occur. To listen for changes in this manner, request a 
       continous feed and pass an explicit callback (i.e., do <em>not</em> call <code>yield</code> this time):</p>
    {{{changes_feed}}}
    <p>The return value of a feed request is a <code>ChangesFeed</code> object. It will keep the connection alive
       and handles the invocation of your callback at regular intervals (see the <code a="#">latency</code> parameter).
       The feed will continue listening until it is explicitly stopped:</p>
    {{{changes_stop}}}

    <h1>Further Reading</h1>
    <p>The overall documentation scene for Couch isn’t quite as focused as it could be. There’s quite a bit of 
      good infomation out there, but it’s scattered all over the net. Here are some I’ve found useful:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://guide.couchdb.org/">The O’Reilly Book</a> – Somewhat dated at this point but mostly in terms
        of missing features (i.e., it won’t lead you astray recommending deprecated approaches or the like).</li>
        
      <li><a href="http://www.couchbase.com/docs/couchdb-release-1.1/index.html">CouchDB 1.1 Release Notes</a> – Written
        by CouchBase before they pivoted away from using Apache CouchDB. This details most of the changes not covered 
        in the book.</li>

      <li><a href="http://wiki.apache.org/couchdb">The CouchDB Wiki</a> – Less holistic than the book, but more
          up to date. In particular take a look at the <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/couchdb/Reference">Reference</a> section.</li>
          
      <li><a href="http://blog.mudynamics.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/icouch.html">Interactive CouchDB</a> – Click
        on the Map/Reduce tab then say ‘eureka, views make sense now’ about 5 minutes later.</li>
