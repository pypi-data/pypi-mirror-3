Description: Imagy - make your website's images load upto 50% faster
        ===============
        
        Imagy is a file daemon, that watches your website's media root (where your images are stored) and automatically optimizes image files that are created or modified within it. Imagy uses *lossless compression*, so your users never have to load unnecessary bytes while the algorithms used are completely lossless. Your images look the same, but load faster.
        
        A lot of work has gone into making it `set-and-forget`. Instead of having to code up deamons, file watches and handle different file formats on your own, Imagy does all the work for you. All you need to do is
        ::
        
            imagy /awesome/images/
            
        
        The algorithms used are stable (don't further modify files after multiple invocations), however to make trying it out as easy as possible Imagy, by default, keeps the original file around for later reversal. 
        
        If you wish to stop using Imagy, run ``imagy -r`` which will copy all original images back to their initial location
        
        If you have (rightfully) come to the conclusion that you don't really need to keep originals around, set ``KEEP_ORIGINALS`` in ``config.py`` to  ``False``. If you want to delete all already stored originals run ``imagy --deloriginals``.
        
        
        Getting Started 
        -----------------
        
        On ubuntu:
        
        ::
        
            sudo apt-get install pngnq pngcrush imagemagick libjpeg-progs gifsicle
        
        
            pip install imagy
            
        
        That's it. Imagy's now running.
        
        
        You can instead also specifiy the image paths directly in ``config.py`` which already holds a couple of examples
        
        
        Example
        -----------------
        
        As soon as the file
        
        ::
        
            images/img.jpg
        
        gets created, Imagy optimizes it while keeping the original at 
        
        ::
        
            images/img-original.jpg
             
        
        Homage
        -----------------
        
        In the background Imagy uses the awesome library smush which exposes a general interface to handle the various file types.
