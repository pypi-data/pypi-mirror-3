Description: Paver is a Python-based build/distribution/deployment scripting tool along the
        lines of Make or Rake. What makes Paver unique is its integration with 
        commonly used Python libraries. Common tasks that were easy before remain 
        easy. More importantly, dealing with *your* applications specific needs and 
        requirements is also easy.
