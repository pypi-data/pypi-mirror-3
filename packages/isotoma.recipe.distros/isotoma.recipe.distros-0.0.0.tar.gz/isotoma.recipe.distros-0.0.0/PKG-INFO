Description: isotoma.recipe.distros
        ======================
        
        This is a fork of ``plone.recipe.distros`` that uses the zc.buildout Download
        API so that the lovely.buildouthttp monkey patches work on it. You probably
        don't want to use this fork!!!!
        
        Options
        -------
        
        urls
            The URLs of the archives to download. The archives specified in the same
            part will be extracted into the same parts folder named after the part.
            The full path to that folder will be available as 'location' from the
            parts option dictionary.
        
        nested-packages
            The file names of one or more of the archives in the urls list.
            This will cause only the Python packages (identified by a __init__.py) in
            the top folder in the archive to be extracted into the destination.
        
        version-suffix-packages
            The file names of one or more of the archives in the urls list.
            This will cause the part after the last dash to be omitted from the created
            destination folder.
