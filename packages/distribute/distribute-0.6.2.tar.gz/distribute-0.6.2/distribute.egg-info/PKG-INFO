        Installing and Using Distribute
        ===============================

        About the fork
        ==============
        
        `Distribute` is a fork of the `Setuptools` project.
        
        Distribute is intended to replace Setuptools as the standard method
        for working with Python module distributions.
        
        The fork has two goals:
        
        - Providing a backward compatible version to replace Setuptools 
          and make all distributions that depend on Setuptools work as
          before, but with less bugs and behaviorial issues.
        
          This work is done in the 0.6.x series
        
          Starting with version 0.6.2, Distribute supports Python 3. 
          Installing and using distribute for Python 3 code works exactly 
          the same as for Python 2 code, but Distribute also helps you to support 
          Python 2 and Python 3 from the same source code by letting you run 2to3 
          on the code as a part of the build process, by setting the keyword parameter 
          ``use_2to3`` to True. See docs/python3.txt for more information.
        
        - Refactoring the code, and releasing it in several distributions.
          This work is being done in the 0.7.x series but not yet released.
        
        If you install `Distribute` and want to switch back for any reason to
        `Setuptools`, get to the `Uninstallation instructions`_ section.
        
        More documentation
        ==================
        
        You can get more information in the Sphinx-based documentation, located
        in the archive in `docs`. This documentation includes the old Setuptools
        documentation that is slowly replaced, and brand new content.
        
        About the installation process
        ==============================
        
        The `Distribute` installer modifies your installation by de-activating an
        existing installation of `Setuptools` in a bootstrap process. This process 
        has been tested in various installation schemes and contexts but in case of a 
        bug during this process your Python installation might be left in a broken
        state. Since all modified files and directories are copied before the 
        installation, you will be able to get back to a normal state by reading
        the instructions in the `Uninstallation instructions`_ section.
        
        In any case, it is recommended to save you `site-packages` directory before 
        you start the installation of `Distribute`.
        
        -------------------------
        Installation Instructions
        -------------------------
        
        Distribute is only released as a source distribution.
        
        It can be installed using easy_install or pip, and can be done so with the source
        tarball, the eggs distribution, or by using the ``distribute_setup.py`` script
        provided online.
        
        ``distribute_setup.py`` is the simplest and preferred way on all systems.
        
        distribute_setup.py
        ===================
        
        Download ``distribute_setup.py`` and execute it, using the Python interpreter of
        your choice.
        
        If your shell has the ``wget`` program you can do::
        
            $ wget http://nightly.ziade.org/distribute_setup.py
            $ python distribute_setup.py
        
        easy_install or pip
        ===================
        
        Run easy_install or pip::
        
            $ easy_install Distribute
            $ pip install Distribute
        
        Source installation
        ===================
        
        Download the source tarball, uncompress it, then run the install command::
        
            $ wget http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/d/distribute/distribute-0.6.1.tar.gz
            $ tar -xzvf distribute-0.6.1.tar.gz
            $ cd distribute-0.6
            $ python setup.py install
        
        ---------------------------
        Uninstallation Instructions
        ---------------------------
        
        Like other distutils-based distributions, Distribute doesn't provide an 
        uninstaller yet. It's all done manually!
        
        Distribute is installed in three steps:
        
        1. it gets out of the way an existing installation of Setuptools
        2. it installs a `fake` setuptools installation 
        3. it installs distribute
        
        Distribute can be removed like this:
        
        - run ``easy_install -m Distribute``. This will remove the Distribute reference
          from ``easy-install.pth``. Otherwise, edit the file and remove it yourself.
        - remove the ``distribute*.egg`` file located in your site-packages directory
        - remove the ``setuptools.pth`` file located in you site-packages directory
        - remove the easy_install script located in you ``sys.prefix/bin`` directory
        - remove the ``setuptools*.egg`` directory located in your site-packages directory,
          if any.
        
        If you want to get back to setuptools:
        
        - reinstall setuptools using its instruction.
        
        Lastly:
        
        - remove the *.OLD.* directory located in your site-packages directory if any,
          **once you have checked everything was working correctly again**.

        Install FAQ
        -----------
        
        - **Why Distribute turn my Setuptools installation into an fake one?**
        
           Since Distribute is a fork, and since it provides the same package and modules,
           it fakes that the Setuptools installation is still present, so all the programs
           that where using Setuptools still work.
        
           If it wasn't doing it, a program that would try to install Setuptools 
           would overwrite in turn Distribute.
        
        - **How does Distribute interacts with virtualenv?**
        
          Everytime you create a virtualenv it will install setuptools, so you need to
          re-install Distribute in it right after. The Distribute project will not
          attempt to patch virtualenv so it uses it when globally installed.
        
          Once installed, your virtualenv will use Distribute transparently.
        
          Although, if you have Setuptools installed in your system-wide Python,
          and if the virtualenv you are in was generated without the `--no-site-packages`
          option, the Distribute installation will stop.
        
          You need in this case to build a virtualenv with the --no-site-packages option
          or to install `Distribute` globally.
        
        - **How does Distribute interacts with zc.buildout?**
        
          Some work is being done on zc.buildout side to make its bootstrap
          work with Distribute. Until then, using Distribute in zc.buildout is a bit
          tricky because the bootstrap process of zc.buildout hardcodes the
          installation of Setuptools.
        
          The plan is to come with a custom bootstrap.py for zc.buildout for the
          0.6.3 release, together with some small changes on zc.buildout side.
