Description: Introduction
        ---------------
        
        AuthBWC is a component for `BlazeWeb <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/BlazeWeb/>`_
        applications.  It provides users, groups, permissions, related helpers
        and views.  Proper integration of this component will allow applications to have
        views that can only be accessed by certain users.
        
        Includes email notifications when an account is created as well as an email
        based password reset mechanism.

        0.1.4 released 2011-01-07
        =========================
        
        * SECURITY FIX: fixed an issue with the way the HTTP session user permissions
            were loaded.  This vulnerability made it possible for a user to gain the
            permissions of the user logged in previously.  The user would have had
            to be sharing the same http session for this access to have been
            gained.
        
        0.1.3 released 2010-11-24
        =========================
        
        * modifying after_login_url() to take script_name into account (requires BlazeWeb
            upgrade to 0.3.1)
