## Goals

 - audio-only processing
 - video-only processing
 - handle both static and live inputs + outputs
 - explicit + implicit input setup
 - explicit + implicit output setup
 - a/v sync

## Questions

### Push vs. pull control.

 - let's stick to pull for now, and also provide callbacks for audio_
   and video_input

### Format compatibility

Resolutions, aspect ratios, frame rates, sample sizes, sample rates...

Solution: convert inputs to a common format with a sensible default.
