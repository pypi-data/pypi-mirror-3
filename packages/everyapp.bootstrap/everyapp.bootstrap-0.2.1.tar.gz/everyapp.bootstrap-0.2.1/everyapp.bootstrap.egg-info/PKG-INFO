        About
        =====
        
        *everyapp.bootstrap* provides an enhanced and customizable virtualenv_
        bootstrap script.  It aims to make it easy to bootstrap a virtual environment
        for your project.
        
        This project includes a tool to generate a bootstrap script that will
        automatically create the virtual environment when run.  By placing the
        bootstrap script in the root of your project's source tree and making it
        available on a fresh checkout/clone from your version control repository, you
        make it easy for anyone who wants to hack on your project (including yourself!)
        to work in a consistent development environment.
        
        Additionally, this enhanced bootstrap script can read a configuration file and
        perform additional actions beyond just creating a bare-bones virtual
        environment.

        Features
        ========
        
        * Easy creation of a virtualenv_ bootstrap script.
        * Better defaults for virtualenv_, like using distribute_ instead of
          setuptools_ and always unzipping EGGs.
        * Easy customization of the bootstrapping process.
        * Automatic installation of additional distributions using pip_ and/or
          easy_install_.
        * Easy customization of pip_ and easy_install_ behaviour during distribution
          installation.
        * Automatic execution of additional commands after the bootstrapping is
          complete.
        * Adherence to `Semantic Versioning <http://semver.org/spec/v1.0.0.html>`_ in
          order to be a well behaved dependency.

        Status
        ======
        
        This project is very young and the code should be considered *Alpha* quality.
        It has been minimally tested on Linux and Windows, under Python_ 2.6 and 2.7,
        but has not yet been seriously tested on any platform.
        
        That said, it is largely just a wrapper and a few customizations on the
        production-grade virtualenv_ project [#ve1]_, so it should be reasonably
        stable.  It should also be mostly feature complete.
        
        .. installation
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        The easiest way to install this distribution is::
        
          pip install everyapp.bootstrap
        
        or::
        
          easy_install everyapp.bootstrap
        
        For additional information on installing and upgrading, see the `installation
        documentation`_. |(in doc/INSTALL.txt)|
        
        Basic Usage
        ===========
        
        In your project's root directory, run::
        
          mkbootstrap
        
        This will generate a ``bootstrap.py`` script and a ``bootstrap.cfg``
        configuration file.  Edit ``bootstrap.cfg`` as desired, then run::
        
          python bootstrap.py
        
        This will create the virtual environment in the root directory for your
        project.
        
        For additional bootstrap script options and usage information see the `usage
        documentation`_. |(in doc/USAGE.txt)|
