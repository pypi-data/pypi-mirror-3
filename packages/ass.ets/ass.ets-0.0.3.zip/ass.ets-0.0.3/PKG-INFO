Description: The main purpose of an assets management application is to map local paths to urls on the server. Secondly you want to apply filters to sets of files, e.g. you want to merge and minify them. You often want this build-process to be automatic, on-the-fly, just by pressing refresh in your webbrowser. Later, in a production mode of your web application you just want to serve different, specific versions of your files.
        
        Since I was just too dumb to use miracle2k's `webassets <https://github.com/miracle2k/webassets>`_ - did three days to write a new filter, new manifest implementation, then the ASSETS tag for jinja didn't liked my multiple environments - I put together this simple stuff.
        
        As this is alpha, it just doesn't work. Please contribute via `github <http://github.com/kaste/ass.ets>`_. In the following we use three filters; of course you need ``node`` with ``uglifyjs`` and/or ``lessc``; to minify css the python package ``cssmin`` is used. So you need to install these or write your own filters.
        
        ::
        
        	from ass.ets import *
        	from ass.ets.filters import *
        
        	import os
        	here = os.path.dirname( os.path.realpath(__file__) )
        
        	env = Environment(
        		map_from=os.path.join(here, 'static'),
        		map_to='/static',
        		# t.i. a local file ./static/lib.js will later be served as /static/lib.js
        		
        		#use the default implementation
        		manifest=os.path.join(here, 'assets-manifest'),   # we don't want the manifest in the static dir
        		#or provide your own object that answers get(key) and set(key, value)
        		
        		#some defaults
        		production=use_manifest #in production mode we ask the manifest which file to serve, in this case we need to build before we deploy
        		#note: use_manifest is just another filter
        	)
        
        	jslib = bundle(
        		"jquery.1.7.1.js", #...
        		name='jslib',   # the naive manifest implementation uses this name
        		env=env,        # the bundle inherits all the settings from env 
        
        		#very explicit pipe of filters
        		development=[read, merge, store_as('jslib.js')],
        		build_=[read, merge, uglifyjs, store_as('jslib-%(version)s.js'), store_manifest],
        		#yes ^ thats an underscore, because bundles have a build() method
        	)
        
        	# now we could do
        	# env.mode = 'development'
        	# print [url for url in jslib.urls()]
        
        	# in our build script we do
        	# env.mode = 'build_'
        	# print [url for url in jslib.build()]
        
        There's is no much difference between ``urls()`` and ``build()``. In the above example both pipes - 'development' and '\built_' - yield relative paths at the end, ``urls()`` just uses ``env.map_to`` to construct a url, where ``build()`` maps to the local path using ``map_from``.
        Internally ``build()`` appends the following filter to the chain::
        
        	@worker
        	def local_path(files, bundle):
        		for file in files:
        			yield os.path.join(bundle.map_from, file)
        
        The ``@worker`` annotation comes from the `useless.pipes <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/useless.pipes>`_ package.
        
        Ok, add another bundle::
        
        	less_styles = Bundle(
        		'styles.less', 
        		name='less_style',
        		env=env,
        		development=as_is,
        		build_=[read, merge, lessify]
        	)
        	all_styles = Bundle(
        		less_styles, 'main.css',
        		name='all_styles',
        		env=env,
        		development=as_is,
        		build_=[read, merge, minify, store_as('styles-%(version)s.css'), store_manifest]
        	)
        
        T.i. in development mode we just spit the files as they are, when we build the less-file gets 'delessed', after that all css-files are merged and stored. Note that the `less_styles.build_` chain yields the css-content. We don't store a temporary file. The current implementation of `read` actually expects nested bundles to yield contents not filenames. 
        
        Ok, now we need the less-js file in the development version of our app. We write a simple filter::
        
        	def add(*filenames):
        		@worker
        		def add_(items, bundle):
        			for item in items:
        				yield item
        
        			for filename in filenames:
        				yield filename
        
        		return add_			
        
        	# and then
        	less_styles = Bundle(
        		'styles.less', 
        		name='less_style',
        		development=[as_is, add('less-1.2.1.min.js')],
        		build_=[read, merge, lessify]
        	)
        
        
        	# all_styles.urls() now yields .css, .less and .js files in development mode and one .css file in built_ or production mode.
        
        In jinja we could define two macros::
        
        	{%- macro asset(url) %}
                {%- if url.endswith('.js') %}<script type="text/javascript" src="{{ url }}"></script>{%- endif %}
                {%- if url.endswith('.css') %}<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="{{ url }}" />{%- endif %}
                {%- if url.endswith('.less') %}<link rel="stylesheet/less" type="text/css" href="{{ url }}" />{%- endif %}
            {%- endmacro %}
            {%- macro assets_for(bundle) %}
                {%- for url in bundle.urls() %}
                    {{ asset(url) }}
                {%- endfor %}
            {%- endmacro %}
        
        Assume ``Flask`` and ``g.all_styles = all_styles``::
        
        	{{ assets_for(g.all_styles) }}
        
        and we're done.
        
        Some last things; if you often write::
        	
        	[read, merge, uglifyjs, store_as('...'), store_manifest]
        
        You could instead write something like this::
        
        	# no magic here, just tuple + tuple
        	process_js = (read, merge, uglifyjs)
        	jslib.build_ = process_js + (store_as('...'), store_manifest)
        
        OR::
        	
        	def process_js_and_store(fn):
        		return [read, merge, uglifyjs, store_as(fn), store_manifest]
        	jslib.build_ = process_js_and_store('...')
        
        A worker that combines other filters by the way looks rather awkward, just to let you know::
        
        	@worker
        	def read_and_merge(items, bundle):
        		return items | read(bundle) | merge(bundle)
        
        As an example, the naive ``uglifyjs`` filter used herein, looks like this::
        
        	@worker
        	def uglifyjs(files, bundle):
        		args = ['uglifyjs']
        		for file in files:
        			proc = subprocess.Popen(
        				args,
        				stdin=subprocess.PIPE, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE,
        				shell=True)
        			stdout, stderr = proc.communicate(file)
        
        			if proc.returncode != 0:
        				raise FilterError(('uglifyjs: subprocess had error: stderr=%s, '+
        	                               'stdout=%s, returncode=%s') % (
        	                                    stderr, stdout, proc.returncode))
        
        			yield stdout
        
        This filter likely fails because of ``args = ['uglifyjs']`` and ``shell=True``. So contribute back.
