Sphene 0.7
  Changes:
  - We're now using Django 1.2 (introduced backward incompatible changes!)
  - Attachment upload now uses formsets (this allows changing and removing
    attachments).
    Beware that associated template (_displayPostForm.html) was also changed
    so any custom overrides of this template should be updated to use formsets.
  - Added SPHFileWidget that is used by upload form (based on AdminFileWidget)
  - Added caching to Category.__get_absolute_url and Post.__get_absolute_url and
    sphene.community.sphutils->get_user_displayname
  - Added CACHE_MIDDLEWARE_KEY_PREFIX to some cache keys.
  - Added root_post__category, root_post__author, latest_post__author to
    select_related clause at sphboard.views->showCategory to reduce amount
    of database queries
  - Upgraded pagination to support QUERY_STRING parameters and changed display
    of pagination slices. Template tag sph_pagination now accepts additional
    argument: compress = 1/0. If compress is set to 1 then list of
    paginated pages is limited to show at most 7 pages with current page
    in the middle. If parameter 'page' passed to sph_pagination tag
    is '-1' - this happens eg. for list of pages displayed for thread,
    then with compress=1 list of pages is limited to show only six links.

    To use compress=1 call:

        {% sph_pagination page pages '' 'page' 1 %}

    This will result in something like:
    << < 3 4 5 6 7 8 > >>
    instead of:
    1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14
  - Slightly changed toggle_monitor methods to allow admin toggling monitors
    for users
  - Added list of active monitors to user profile
  - Sphboard now uses migrations (if South is present)
  - Added some code in order to make postsyncdb signals used by SCT work while
    using South
  - SCT now uses slughifi to generate slugs. This means that special
    characters are not removed from slug, eg.:
        Title: zażółć gęślą jaźń
    becomes:
        Slug: zazolc-gesla-jazn

    Previously this would be:
        Slug: za-gl-ja
    Beware that this might change your existing links

  - Added new management views:
      * 'List of users'
      * 'List of posts of specific user' (if sphboard is used)
         It is now possible to remove posts of individual user from one place.
         You can also remove all posts of specific user (at last it will be
         possible to remove all spam quickly!)

      these views should be added to template, see this post for details:
         http://sct.sphene.net/board/thread/3708/updates-in-sct/?page=1#post-3708

      New permission was introduced for these views: community_manage_users

  - Permission names and field names in management views are now translated.
  
  Fixes:
  - Fixed bug in user registration that caused no Response object to be returned
    if there were any errors in Registration form (eg. invalid password
    repetition)
  - Fixed displaying of user at 'Edit profile' page. Because 'user' variable
    was passed into template it messed with user from context processor
  - Fixed post count for users - now it is aware of is_hidden attribute of posts
  - Fixed displaying posts in sphcomments - now is_hidden is used in filter
