Description: CassandraLauncher contains two parts:
        
        1. `cassandralauncher` is accessible straight from the command line and launches a Cassandra cluster for you.
        2. `clusterlauncher` is also accessible from the command line and provides a user interface for AWS and RAX.
        
        Both run off of a config: clusterlauncher.conf.
