Version 0.7.1, released on 2012-03-21
=====================================

Change the license from AGPL to BSD.


Version 0.7, released on 2012-03-21
===================================

* Support page breaks between table rows
* Support for the ``orphans`` and ``widows`` properties.

Only avoiding page breaks before/after an element is still missing.


Version 0.6.1, released on 2012-03-01
=====================================

Fix a packaging bug. (Remove use_2to3 in setup.py. We use the same
codebase for Python 2 and 3.)


Version 0.6, released on 2012-02-29
===================================

* *Backward incompatible*: completely change the Python API.
  See the documentation: http://weasyprint.org/using/#as-a-python-library
* *Backward incompatible*: Proper margin collapsing.
  This changes how blocks are rendered: adjoining margins "collapse"
  (their maximum is used) instead of accumulating.
* Support images in ``embed`` or ``object`` elements.
* Switch to pystacia instead of PIL for raster images
* Add compatibility with CPython 2.6 and 3.2. (Previously only 2.7
  was supported)
* Many bug fixes


Version 0.5, released on 2012-02-08
===================================

* Support for the ``overflow`` and ``clip`` properties.
* Support for the ``opacity`` property from CSS3 Colors.
* Support for CSS 2D Transforms. These are prefixed, so you need to use
  ``-weasy-transform`` and ``-weasy-transform-origin``.


Version 0.4, released on 2012-02-07
===================================

* Support ``text-align: justify``, ``word-spacing`` and ``letter-spacing``.
* Partial support for CSS3 Paged Media: page size and margin boxes with
  page-based counters.
* All CSS 2.1 border styles
* Fix SVG images with non-pixel units. Requires CairoSVG 0.3
* Support for ``page-break-before`` and ``page-break-after``, except for
  the value ``avoid``.
* Support for the ``background-clip``, ``background-origin`` and
  ``background-size`` from CSS3 (but still with a single background
  per element)
* Support for the ``image-rendering`` from SVG. This one is prefixed,
  use ``-weasy-image-rendering``. It only has an effect on PNG output.


Version 0.3.1, released on 2011-12-14
===================================

Compatibility with CairoSVG 0.1.2


Version 0.3, released on 2011-12-13
===================================

* **Backward-incompatible change:** the 'size' property is now prefixed (since
  it is in an experimental specification). Use '-weasy-size' instead.
* cssutils 0.9.8 or higher is now required.
* Support SVG images with CairoSVG
* Support generated content: the ``:before`` and ``:after`` pseudo-elements,
  the ``content``, ``quotes`` and ``counter-*`` properties.
* Support ordered lists: all CSS 2.1 values of the ``list-style-type`` property.
* New user-agent stylesheet with HTML 5 elements and automatic quotes for many
  languages. Thanks Peter Moulder!
* Disable cssutils validation warnings, they are redundant with WeasyPrintâ€™s.
* Add ``--version`` to the command-line script.
* Various bug fixes


Version 0.2, released on 2011-11-25
===================================

* Support for tables.
* Support the `box-sizing` property from CSS 3 Basic User Interface
* Support all values of vertical-align except top and bottom. They are
  interpreted as text-top and text-bottom.
* Minor bug fixes

Tables have some limitations:
Only the fixed layout and separate border model are supported.
There are also no page break inside tables so a table higher
than a page will overflow.


Version 0.1, released on 2011-10-28
===================================

First packaged release. Supports "simple" CSS 2.1 pages: there is no
support for floats, tables, or absolute positioning. Other than that
most of CSS 2.1 is supported, as well as CSS 3 Colors and Selectors.
