"""The :mod:`yaak.inject` module implements dependency injection. Here is a
tutorial that explains how to use this module.

First, import the :mod:`yaak.inject` module so that you can use the injection
functionality in your application:

  >>> from yaak import inject

Create a class whose instances have to be injected a *feature*
identified by the string ``IService`` (but could be any hashable type, such
as a class):

  >>> class Client(object):
  ...   service = inject.Attr('IService')  # inject a feature as an attribute
  ...   def use_service(self):
  ...     self.service.do_something()  # use the injected feature
  ...

Also, create a class (or any callable) that implements the *feature*:

  >>> class Service(object):
  ...   def do_something(self):
  ...     print "Service: I'm working hard"
  ...

Then, when you configure your application, you need to wire an implementation
for each *feature*. In this case, we provide an implementation for the
``IService`` feature:

  >>> inject.provide('IService', Service)

Note that we provide a factory (class) for the feature and not the instance
itself. You'll see later why.

Now, a Client instance can use the service:

  >>> client = Client()
  >>> client.use_service()
  Service: I'm working hard

When you use the default :func:`provide` behavior, all instances
of the Client class will be injected the same Service instance:

  >>> another_client = Client()
  >>> client.service is another_client.service
  True

In fact, the default behavior when you :func:`provide` a feature is to create a
thread-local singleton that is injected in all instances that request the
feature. That's what we call the *scope*: it defines the lifespan of the
feature instance.

You may want a different ``IService`` instance for each Client. You can do that
by changing the default scope to :attr:`Scope.Transient` when you provide the
feature:

  >>> inject.provide('IService', Service, scope=inject.Scope.Transient)

Then, a different Service instance is injected in each new Client instance:

  >>> client = Client()
  >>> another_client = Client()
  >>> client.service is another_client.service
  False

You can also declare injected features as function/method parameters instead
of attributes:

  >>> class Client(object):
  ...   @inject.Param(service='IService')
  ...   def __init__(self, text, service):
  ...     self.text = text
  ...     self.service = service
  ...   def use_service(self):
  ...     print self.text
  ...     self.service.do_something()
  ...

Then you could use the Client class and get the parameters injected
automatically if you don't provide a value for them:
  
  >>> client = Client('This is a text')
  >>> client.use_service()
  This is a text
  Service: I'm working hard

That's the easiest way to declare injected parameters. But if you want to
keep your class decoupled from the injection framework, you can also define
the injection afterwards:
  
  >>> class Client(object):
  ...   def __init__(self, text, service):
  ...     self.text = text
  ...     self.service = service
  ...   def use_service(self):
  ...     print self.text
  ...     self.service.do_something()
  ...
  >>> inject_service = inject.Param(service='IService')
  >>> InjectedClient = inject_service(Client)
  >>> client = InjectedClient('This is a text')
  >>> client.use_service()
  This is a text
  Service: I'm working hard
