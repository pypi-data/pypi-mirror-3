        Centipede 0.2.2
        ===============
        
        Centipede is a WSGI microframework with a simple decorator based router. It's strength is that it models the technology in use and tries not to confuse developers with complex patterns and tricks. It inherits strongly from urlrelay_.
        
        Installation
        ============
        ::
        
            $ pip install centipede
        
        Defining handlers
        =================
        With Centipede you expose functions to urls. Functions either return a **string** or a **tuple**. A string is treated as the document body, http status is set to *200 OK* and returned to the browser. Should you return a tuple, *status code*, *body* and *headers* are expected. The expose decorator also supports a few arguments.
        
        ::
        
        	from centipede import expose, app
        
        	@expose('^/$')
        	def index(request):
        	    """ Simple Hello IgglePigglePartyPants
        	    """
        	    return 'Hello IgglePigglePartyPants!'
        
        	@expose('^/google$')
        	def index(request):
        	    """ A redirect
        	    """
        	    return (307, '', {'Location':'http://google.com'})
         
        	import json
         
        	@expose('^/params$', 'GET', content_type='application/json')
        	def twitter(request):
        	    """ JSON dump the params
        	    """
        	    return json.dumps(request['params'])
            
        	application = app()
        
        
        Expose arguments
        ================
        The expose decorator looks like this::
        
            expose(url_pattern, method='GET', content_type='text/html', charset='UTF-8')
        
        Request
        =======
        The parameter passed to the functions exposed (*request* in the examples above) is the WSGI environ_ dictionary. For convenience the GET and POST parameters are packed into environ's **params** key. These parameters are unquoted using *urllib.unquote*. Raw parameters are passed to the **params_raw** key.
        
        Templates
        =========
        I would recommend keeping your html templates static on the client side and use a javascript template library. But if you really need some server side templating, have a look at mako.
        
        Deployment
        ==========
        For deployment it is a good idea to run your centipede application behind a good WSGI server. There is a bunch_. Gunicorn_ is good. I usually end up running uwsgi_ behind nginx.
