Description: =============
        Django-Scrypt
        =============
        
        **WARNING**
        
        This is alpha software under active development. It was only tested
        on **Python 2.7**. It probably will not run on Python 2.5 since
        *py-scrypt* doesn't run on anything earlier than Python 2.6.
        
        Basic Usage
        ~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        To use Scrypt as your default storage algorithm in Django 1.4, do the
        following:
        
        Install the py-scrypt library version 0.5.5 or later (probably by running ``sudo pip install py-scrypt``, or downloading the library and installing it with ``python setup.py install``).
        
        **Py-Scrypt 0.5.5 contains a major bug on 64-bit Linux**
        
        Next, install Django-Scrypt::
        
          $ python setup.py install
        
        Then, run the test suite::
        
          $ python setup.py test
        
        In your Django 1.4 application *settings.py* file, modify (or add) the
        ``PASSWORD_HASHERS`` tuple to include ``ScryptPasswordHasher`` first.
        
        For example::
        
          PASSWORD_HASHERS = (
            'django_scrypt.hashers.ScryptPasswordHasher',
            'django.contrib.auth.hashers.PBKDF2PasswordHasher',
            'django.contrib.auth.hashers.PBKDF2SHA1PasswordHasher',
            'django.contrib.auth.hashers.SHA1PasswordHasher',
            'django.contrib.auth.hashers.MD5PasswordHasher',
            'django.contrib.auth.hashers.CryptPasswordHasher',
          )
        
        Note: You need to keep the other hasher entries in this list, or else Django
        won't be able to upgrade passwords!
        
        You have now changed your app to use Scrypt as the default storage algorithm.
        
        More Stuff?
        ~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        There is a bit more to the software, but you will have to read the source to
        figure it out. :)
