        How it works
        ============
        
        Add an File with zipped content, this will be marked with 'collective.archiveviewer.interfaces.IArchiveFile'.
        
        Now you can access the content trough web by appending '@@contents/$filename' to the path of your file.
        
        For instance, if you have a file 'foo.html' inside the archive you can view it by going to 'http://yourplone.com/yourzipfile/@@contents/foo.html'.
