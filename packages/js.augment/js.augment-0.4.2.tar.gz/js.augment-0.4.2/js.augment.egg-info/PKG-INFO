        Introduction
        ============
        
        This library packages `Augment.js`_ for `fanstatic`_.
        
        .. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
        .. _`Augment.js`: http://augmentjs.com/
        
        This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
        and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
        directory in ``js.augment``) are published to some URL.
