* Change the Creator field to use the correct query operation for filtering

  This fixes https://dev.plone.org/ticket/12052
  [jcerjak]

* Limit number of items that show up in the preview of the edit view to 25.
  If we do not limit these results all items in the query will be rendered in
  the preview which leads to problems when the collection contains > 10k
  results.
