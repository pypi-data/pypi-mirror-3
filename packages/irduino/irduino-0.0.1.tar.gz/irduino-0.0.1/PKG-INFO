        =======
        
        IRduino is a Mac/Windows cross-platform system to utilize an Arduino 
        with IR TV remotes to control XBMC by mapping their buttons to keystrokes.
        For the time being, this is a rather inefficient process of logging codes
        by copy and pasting, but, as this is a learning experience, I hope to soon
        incorporate.
