    ==========
    
    dicompyler is an extensible open source radiation therapy research 
    platform based on the DICOM standard. It also functions as a 
    cross-platform DICOM RT viewer.
    
    dicompyler runs on Windows, Mac and Linux systems and is available in 
    source and binary versions. Since dicompyler is based on modular 
    architecture, it is easy to extend it with 3rd party plugins.
