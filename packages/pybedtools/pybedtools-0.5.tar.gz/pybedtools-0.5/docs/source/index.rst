Welcome to pybedtools's documentation!
======================================

.. include:: ../../README.rst

The documentation is separated into 4 main parts, depending on the depth you'd
like to cover:

* Lazy, or just want to jump in?  Check out :ref:`3examples` to
  get a feel for the package.
* Want a guided tour?  Give the :ref:`tutorial` a shot.
* More advanced features are described in the :ref:`topical` section. 
* Finally, doctested module documentation can be found in :ref:`autodoc`.


A PDF version of this manual can be found `here`_.
