Description: Tromegle:  Troll Strangers!
        ========
        Tromegle started as a project through which to learn about HTTP requests and asynchronous I/O.  The idea was
        to learn how to use urllib(2) and later Twisted while having a bit of fun at the expense of a few [Omegle](http://omegle.com) users, or "strangers".
        It has since evolved into an unofficial API, complete with a simple client class.
        
        ###Trolling is a Art!
        The nonstandard functionality of Tromegle is centered around a relatively simple [man-in-the-middle attack](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack).
        
        The power of Tromegle lies in the Transmogrifier class, which allows for the conditional modification or injection of AJAX events
        and, by extension, user messages.  In plain English, this means **you can modify the message a user sends to another**
        as well as pass messages that only one user will see!
        
        ###Trolling gently
        Sometimes it's just fun to evesdrop; internet users are often funny despite themselves.  Tromegle gives you the
        tools to either observe or record conversations, or relevant portions thereof.
        
        Getting Tromegle
        ========
        As of right now, the easiest way to obtain Tromegle is to clone this git repository with this command:
        
        ```git clone https://github.com/louist87/tromegle.git```
        
        The package can then be installed withe the following commands:
        ```
        cd tromegle
        sudo python setup.py install
        ```
        
        I do plan to release this library as a pip package when it leaves alpha.
        
        Dependencies
        ========
        Tromegle requires that you have the latest version of [Twisted](http://twistedmatrix.com/) installed.
        
        Canonical installation instructions can be found on the above website, but the following installation steps
        should work.
        
        ###Ubuntu (or other Debian-based distro)
        
        ```sudo apt-get install python-twisted```
        
        ###Windows
        
        Download the installer from [here][download]
        
        ###Any OS with pip installed (Mac/Win/*nix)
        
        ```pip install Twisted```
        
        ###OSX
        
        I don't own an Apple computer (too rich for my blood), but I understand that [OSX has shipped with Twisted pre-installed-ish since 2007][osx].
        So, there's a good chance that this code works with zero setup - woohoo! If you happen to have an OSX box, please give it a shot
        and let me know how it goes. Thanks!
        
        If you have trouble with the OSX version of Twisted, try [downloading the tarball][download] and installing it to a different `PYTHONPATH` than the default.

        Using Tromegle
        ========
        So far, the MiddleMan class is the only attack that is working.  More work will follow, including documentation.
        
        ```python
        
        import tromegle
        
        m = tromegle.MiddleMan()
        tromegle.reactor.run()
        ```
