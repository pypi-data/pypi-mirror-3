Description: Extended Autocomplete provides a few features that are not
        available in the default autocomplete widget shipped with `Deform
        <http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/deform/en/latest/>`_. Essentially,
        Extended Autocomplete allows the developer to show a value to the user
        that is different from the one that is returned by the widget.
        
        For further details, see the documentation at
