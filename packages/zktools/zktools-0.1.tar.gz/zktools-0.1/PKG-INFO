        Zookeeper Tools
        ===============
        
        ``zktools`` is a package of tools implementating higher level constructs using
        `Apache Zookeeper`_.
        
        It currently provides:
        
        * A Zookeeper Connection object that handles proxying calls to zookeeper
          using the correct zookeeper handle, and re-establishing the connection
          during connection loss in a call.
        * A Zookeeper lock with support for non-blocking acquire, modeled on Python's
          Lock objects that also includes a `Revocable Shared Locks with Freaking Laser
          Beams` described in the `Zookeeper Recipe's <http://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/current/recipes.html#sc_recoverableSharedLocks>`_.
        
        See `the full docs`_ for more  information.
