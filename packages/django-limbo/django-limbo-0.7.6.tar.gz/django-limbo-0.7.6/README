Django Limbo
This is a library of django tools that are used to extend default django functionality.

To install:

1. Run python setup.py

2. Add limbo and any of the limbo apps to settings.py INSTALLED_APPS

3. Add to urls.py
Add to your url root url conf at a url like this:
    (r'^util/', include('limbo.urls', namespace='limbo'))

Note: The namespace is important!

Limbo does not have any models at this time that are not abstract.
