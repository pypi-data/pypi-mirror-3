    Adapter
        *"In computer programming, the adapter design pattern (often referred
        to as the wrapper pattern or simply a wrapper) translates one interface
        for a class into a compatible interface. An adapter allows classes to
        work together that normally could not because of incompatible
        interfaces, by providing its interface to clients while using the
        original interface. The adapter translates calls to its interface into
        calls to the original interface, and the amount of code necessary to do
        this is typically small. The adapter is also responsible for
        transforming data into appropriate forms."*

        -- `Adapter pattern at Wikipedia`_

      In this project, this pattern has been formalized by the use of the
      zope.interface_ and zope.component_ packages.  zope.interface_ prvides a
      method to formally define interfaces independent of their
      implementations, and zope.component_ facilitates the creation and
      registration of adapters when they are necessary.

      You can find more information on the Zope Component Architecture and it's
      adapter system by reading `A Comprehensive Guide to Zope Component
      Architecture`_ by Baiju M, in particular `chapter 4`_, as well as in the
      documentation for the zope.interface_ and zope.component_ packages.  For
      more general information about adapters, see the `Wikipedia page on the
      adapter pattern`_.

    Callable
      In Python_, A callable is a generic term for any object that can be
      called.  This is usually a function or a method, but can be any object
      that defines a :meth:`!__call__` method.  For more information see the
      Python_ documentation on `Emulating callable objects`_

    Coroutine
        *"A coroutine is a generalization of the subroutine. Forget for a
        moment everything you've been taught about calling functions, and
        stacks, etc... Think back to BASIC, and the evil GOTO statement.
        Imagine a more powerful GOTO that could jump back and forth between
        functions, passing arguments, and you begin to get the idea."*

        *"Coroutines are a bit of ancient forgotten computer-science lore;
        stamped out of the collective memory by the hegemony of C. But they are
        useful in a wide variety of situations that can only be clumsily solved
        using 'standard' tools like threads and processes."*

        -- `Coroutines In Python`_

      Coroutines in Python_ are described in :PEP:`342`.  There is an excellent
      presentation on Python_ coroutines titled `A Curious Course on Coroutines
      and Concurrency`_ by `David Beazley`_.  For information on coroutines in

    Framework
      For this project, a framework is simply defined as something that calls
      your code, rather than your code calling it.  (As opposed to a
      `library`.)  For general information on the concept if a framework in
      software, see the `Wikipedia page on software frameworks`_.

    Generator
        *"A generator is, simply put, a function which can stop whatever it is
        doing at an arbitrary point in its body, return a value back to the
        caller, and, later on, resume from the point it had `frozen' and
        merrily proceed as if nothing had happened."*

    Producer
      For this project, a producer is a coroutine that produces messages to be
      consumed, but does not consume any messages itself (aside from shutdown
      messages).  For example, reading lines from a files and send them out one
      at a time.  For general information on the concept of a producer, see the
      `Wikipedia page on the Producer-consumer problem`_.
