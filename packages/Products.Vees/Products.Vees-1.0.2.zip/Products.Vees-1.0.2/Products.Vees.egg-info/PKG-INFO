Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        Vee replaces the normal, linear science report and puts it into a visual map.
        This map is organized around a graphic of a Vee.  This Vee map makes sense to 
        our brains about the way knowledge is created and becomes a tool which actually
        makes it easy for students to take charge of their own experiments/inquiry. 
        Say good bye to 'cook-book' labs.
