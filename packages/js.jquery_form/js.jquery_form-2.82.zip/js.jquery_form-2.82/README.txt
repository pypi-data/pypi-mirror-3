js.jquery_form
**************

Introduction
============

This library packages `jQuery Form`_ for `fanstatic`_.

.. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
.. _`jQuery Form`: http://jquery.malsup.com/form

This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
directory in ``js.jquery_form``) are published to some URL.
