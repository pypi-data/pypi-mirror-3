.. function:: findConsecutiveScale(source, targetScale, degreesRequired=5, stepSize=1, comparisonAttribute='name', repeatsAllowed=True, restsAllowed=False)


    Given a pitch source and a concrete scale, return references to all elements found that represent consecutive scale segments in one direction.

    The `targetScale` is a concrete scale instance.

    The `degreesRequired` specifies how many consecutive scale degrees are required for grouping. Note that if more are found, the will continue to be gathered until a break is found.

    The `stepSize` determines what scale step size is examined

    The `comparisonAttribute` is the Pitch class attribute used for all pitch comparisons; this can be used to force enharmonic comparison ('name'), pitch space comparison ('nameWithOctave') or permit pitch class matching ('pitchClass').

    If `repeatsAllowed` is True, repeated Pitches will be counted as part of the consecutive segment.

    If `restsAllowed` is True, rests will not interrupt a consecutive segment.
