Extended Autocomplete provides a few features that are not
available in the default autocomplete widget shipped with `Deform
<http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/deform/en/latest/>`_. Essentially,
Extended Autocomplete allows the developer to show a value to the user
that is different from the one that is returned by the widget.
