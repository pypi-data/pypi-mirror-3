What is Cynic?
--------------
These days almost any application has several integration points
like database, payment gateway, or some Web service that it consumes
over HTTP.

All communication with the remote systems happens over the network and
both networks and those systems often go wonky.

If we do not test the behavior of **our** system when the remote end
operates out of spec and goes haywire the only place for testing
becomes in production which is, as we all know, for some systems is
less than acceptable.

Because the calls to the remote systems use network, the socket
connection can have different failure scenarios, for example:

- The remote end resets the connection by sending a TCP RST packet

- The connection may be established, but the response is never sent
  back and the connection is not closed (If you don't use socket
  timeouts in your app you may be in trouble at some point).

- The remote end can send garbage data as the response

- The service can send HTML over HTTP instead of the expected JSON
  response

- The HTTP service can send one byte of the response data every 30
  seconds

- The remote HTTP service sends only headers and no body

- The service can send megabytes of data instead of expected kilobytes

- Etc.

It would be good to be able to test the behavior of our application
when some of those conditions happen.

**Cynic** tries to help with that testing. Basically it's a test
harness (test double) that can be used to simulate crafty and devious
remote systems right from your command line.

Cynic will try hard to cause injury to your system.

*It's goal is to make your system under test cynical.*

Installation
------------

::

    $ [sudo] pip install cynic

Or the bleeding edge version from the git master branch:

::

    $ [sudo] pip install git+https://github.com/rspivak/cynic.git#egg=cynic


Quick intro
-----------

Start Cynic which in turn will start multiple services on different
ports:

::

    $ cynic
    INFO     [2012-06-03 23:44:35,603] server: Starting 'HTTPHtmlResponse'   on port 2000
    INFO     [2012-06-03 23:44:35,603] server: Starting 'HTTPJsonResponse'   on port 2001
    INFO     [2012-06-03 23:44:35,604] server: Starting 'HTTPNoBodyResponse' on port 2002
    INFO     [2012-06-03 23:44:35,604] server: Starting 'HTTPSlowResponse'   on port 2003
    INFO     [2012-06-03 23:44:35,604] server: Starting 'RSTResponse'        on port 2020
    INFO     [2012-06-03 23:44:35,604] server: Starting 'RandomDataResponse' on port 2021
    INFO     [2012-06-03 23:44:35,604] server: Starting 'NoResponse'         on port 2022
    INFO     [2012-06-03 23:44:35,604] server: Starting 'LogRecordHandler'   on port /tmp/_cynic.sock


Test different services
=======================

1. Connect to the service on port 2020 and get a TCP RST packet
   right away which causes 'Connection reset by peer' message on the
   command line

  ::

      $ curl http://localhost:2020
      curl: (56) Recv failure: Connection reset by peer

2. Connect to the service on port 2021 and get back 7 bytes of random data

  ::

      $ telnet localhost 2021
      Trying 127.0.0.1...
      Connected to localhost.
      Escape character is '^]'.
      #6
      Connection closed by foreign host.

3. Connect to the service on port 2001 to get the HTTP JSON response

  ::

      $ curl http://localhost:2001
      {"message": "Hello, World!"}


So you got the basic idea. Point your application's integration points to the
Cynic's services and see how your app reacts.


Let's check out Cynic's help options
------------------------------------

::

    $ cynic -h
    Usage: cynic [options]

    Test harness to make your system under test cynical

    Options:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -c CONFIG_PATH, --config=CONFIG_PATH
                            Path to an INI configuration file. If no configuration
                            file is provided then default configuration is
                            applied. To see the default configuration use -d
                            option described below.
      -d, --dump            Dump default configuration to STDOUT


As you can see if we start **Cynic** without **-c** option the default
configuration is used and **-d** is used to dump that configuration to
the standard out.

Let's see what's included in the default configuration


Default configuration

    port = 0
    family = unix


There are basically two types of handlers:

1. The ones that deal with any TCP socket protocol
2. HTTP specific handlers


Let's have a closer look at some of them.

cynic.handlers.httpslow.HTTPSlowResponse
========================================

This handler sends one byte of the HTTP response every 30 seconds.
The config part is as follows

::

    [handler:httpslow]
    # sends one byte of the response every 30 seconds.
    # when the data to be sent is exhausted - terminates
    class = cynic.handlers.httpslow.HTTPSlowResponse
    #args = ('/tmp/test.json', 'application/json', 1)
    host = 0.0.0.0
    port = 2003

where

*class* - a fully qualified dotted Python name of the handler class

*args* - a tuple of Python values to pass as positional arguments to the handler's constructor.

       **First argument** specifies absolute path to a file to read
       the data from instead of using a default data sting 'Hello, world!'

       **Second argument** specifies the value of HTTP's Content-Type
       response header

       **Third argument** specifies time interval in seconds, default
       is 30, after which additional byte is sent to the client

*host* - an IP address to bind the service to (For Unix socket it's a file path)

*port* - port to listen on (not applicable for Unix sockets)


Even with this service alone you can be creative and come up with
several test scenarios that will make the life of your system under
test quite unbearable:

1. Specify file in the *args* that contains megabytes of data and see how
   your system handles such a large response

2. You can change file path and content type arguments to send HTML,
   JSON, XML, Plain text, etc

3. You can send HTML data but set Content-Type header value to
   *application/json*

4. You can change time interval to test your socket read timeout
   expiration or lack thereof.

5. You can have all above as separate services on different ports.
   Just add *[handler:httpslow1]*, *[handler:httpslow2]*, etc. sections to
   the INI file and tweak the *args*.


Extending Cynic with custom handlers
------------------------------------

It's very easy to add your own handler to the Cynic.

1. To add a new TCP handler inherit from *cynic.handlers.base.BaseHandler*
   and implement the *handle* method which directly interacts with a
   TCP socket.

2. To add a new HTTP handler inherit from
   *cynic.handlers.base.BaseHTTPHandler* and implement your custom
   do_GET, do_POST, do_PUT, etc methods.
   For more information about the handler see `BaseHTTPRequestHandler <http://docs.python.org/library/basehttpserver.html#BaseHTTPServer.BaseHTTPRequestHandler>`_

3. Add a section *[handler:my_new_name]* to the INI configuration file with corresponding
   configuration parameters.
