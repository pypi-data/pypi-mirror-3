Description: Django Dataforms
        ================
        
        **django-dataforms** is a wrapper for the Django forms API that lets you dynamically
        define forms in a database, rather than hard-coding form definitions. This can be
        especially helpful for projects that have many forms and/or forms which constantly
        change, and you don't want to be constantly updating models and schemas.
        No model creation required.
        
        See the `Documentaion`__ for more information.
        
        
        Go from this...
        ---------------
        
        ::
        
        # forms.py
        from django import forms
        
        class ContactForm(forms.Form):
        subject = forms.CharField(max_length=100)
        message = forms.CharField()
        sender = forms.EmailField()
        cc_myself = forms.BooleanField(required=False)
        
        # view.py
        def contact(request):
        if request.method == 'POST':
        form = ContactForm(request.POST)
        # ...
        else:
        form = ContactForm()
        
        return render_to_response('contact.html', {'form': form,})
        
        
        To this!
        --------
        
        ::
        
        # Now your form is stored in the database and you can
        # change it without changing a model and DB schema!
        create_form(request, form="contact-form" submission="mySubmission")
