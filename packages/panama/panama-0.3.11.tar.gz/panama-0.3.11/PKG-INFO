        ===========
        
        PANAMA is a novel probabilistic model to account for confounding factors in eQTL studies.
        
        Hidden confounding factors, such as unobserved covariates or unknown
        subtle environmental perturbations can create spurious false
        associations or mask real genetic association signals. In contrast to
        previous methods, PANAMA learns hidden factors jointly with the effect
        of prominent genetic regulators. As a result, this new model can more
        accurately distinguish true genetic association signals from
        confounding variation.
