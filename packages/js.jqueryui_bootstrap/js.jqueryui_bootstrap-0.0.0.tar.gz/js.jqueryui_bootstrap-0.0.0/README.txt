Introduction
============

This library packages `jQuery UI Bootstrap theme`_ for `fanstatic`_. It is aware of different modes (normal, minified).

.. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
.. _`jQuery UI Bootstrap theme`: http://github.com/addyosmani/jquery-ui-bootstrap/

This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
directory in ``js.jqueryui_bootstrap``) are published to some URL.
