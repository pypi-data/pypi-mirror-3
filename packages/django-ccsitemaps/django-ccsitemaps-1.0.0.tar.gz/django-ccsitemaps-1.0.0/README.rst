About
--------------------------------------------

django-ccsitemaps is a static sitemap generator for django.  Unlike the bundled sitemaps application that ships with Django, ccsitemaps builds a static sitemap that is regenerated with a management command or if you're feeling fancy you can hook up the signals to a celery task
