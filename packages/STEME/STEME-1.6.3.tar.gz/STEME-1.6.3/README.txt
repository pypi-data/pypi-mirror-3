 An accurate efficient motif finder for large data sets

Installation instructions can be found in the file docs/_build/html/index.html in the STEME
distribution. If this file does not exist you can make it using the Sphinx package
(http://sphinx.pocoo.org/) by typing "make html" in the docs/ directory. Or more easily
you should be able to find it on the web__ .
