        __ http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/

        Warnings
        ========
        
        When you DON'T need this
        ------------------------
        
        You **must not** install this product if your Plone site already have other jQueryUI products like:
        
        * `collective.js.jqueryui`__ (the most common)
        * `collective.javascript.jqueryui`__
        * ...others?
        
        __ http://pypi.python.org/pypi/collective.js.jqueryui
        __ http://pypi.python.org/pypi/collective.javascript.jqueryui
        
        All products above have some drawbacks. For example latest ``collective.js.jqueryui`` doesn't play well with
        Plone 3 (and the Plone 3 compatible version doesn't include autocomplete plugin yet).
        
        On the other hand ``collective.javascript.jqueryui`` cleaner but don't register any resource.
        
        When you need this
        ------------------
        
        You need to use jQueryUI autocomplete but you don't want to include the whole jQueryUI stuff that products
        above give you.
