  <h1>Basket &mdash; a local static PyPI repository builder</h1>

  <div class="layout">

    <p>
      Basket is a small command-line utility that downloads Python
      packages from a (real) PyPI server and store them in a single
      place so that they can be found by <code>easy_install</code>
      or <code>pip</code> when offline.
    </p>

    <p class="clear">
      I often work offline (typically in the train). It is not unusal
      then to have to create a virtual environment and fill it with
      the Python packages I need. Without an Internet connection, I
      could copy Python packages from an environment to another, but
      this is a bit cumbersome. I need a local PyPI repository. Basket
      allows me to build and maintain such a repository.
    </p>

    <p>
      Basket is not a PyPI mirror. It is not a server: you cannot register
      or upload packages. It does not install Python packages in a Python
      installation or a virtual environment.
    </p>

    <h2>Usage</h2>
    <p>
      You need Python 2.7 or Python 3.2 to run Basket. It may work
      with other versions but this has not been tested.
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Install Basket:</p>
        <pre class="code">
$ easy_install Basket</pre>
        <p>or:</p>
        <pre>
$ pip install Basket</pre>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Initialize your Basket repository:</p>
        <pre>
$ basket init
Repository has been created: ~/.basket</pre>
        <p>
          This will create a <code>.basket/</code> directory in your
          home folder. If this location is not appropriate, you may
          configure it by setting a
          <code>BASKET_ROOT</code> environment variable. If the
          directory already exists, an error message will be
          printed.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Download one or more packages:</p>
        <pre>
$ basket download unittest2
Added unittest2 0.5.1.
$ basket download nose coverage
Added coverage 3.5.2.
Added nose 1.1.2.</pre>
        <p>
          Basket searches for the name of the package so the case does
          not matter:
        </p>
        <pre>
$ basket download MySql-pYthon
Added MySQL-python 1.2.3.</pre>
        <p>
          If you already have the latest version of the requested
          package, Basket will not download it again. If there is a
          more recent version, Basket will download it but will also
          keep the old one. This is a feature: if you want to remove
          old versions, use the <code>prune</code> command (see
          below).
        </p>
        <p>Basket also downloads requirements:</p>
        <pre>
$ basket download Jinja2
Added Jinja2 2.6.
  -&gt; requires: Babel
Added Babel 0.9.6.</pre>
        <p>
          See the <a href="#limitations-and-features">Limitations and
          features</a> section below for further details about which
          packages can be downloaded and how Basket handle
          requirements.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>List all downloaded packages:</p>
        <pre>
$ basket list
Babel 0.9.6
coverage 3.5.2
Jinja2 2.6
MySQL-python 1.2.3
nose 1.1.2
unittest2 0.5.1</pre>
        <p>Or only one or more specific packages:</p>
        <pre>
$ basket list nose
nose 1.1.2
$ basket list nose coverage
coverage 3.5.2
nose 1.1.2</pre>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          You probably want to update packages regularly. The
          following will download the latest version of each existing
          package if you do not have it already:
        </p>
        <pre>
$ basket update nose
nose is already up to date (1.1.2).</pre>
        <p>
          Ok, we have the latest versions. Let's mess with the
          repository to make it think that we actually have an old
          version of <code>nose</code>:
        </p>
        <pre>
$ mv ~/.basket/nose-1.1.2.tar.gz ~/.basket/nose-1.1.1.tar.gz
$ basket list nose
nose 1.1.1</pre>
        <p>And ask again:</p>
        <pre>
$ basket update nose
Added nose 1.1.2.</pre>
        <p>
          As indicated above for the <code>download</code> command,
          old versions are kept alongside the latest one. This is a
          feature.
        </p>
        <pre>
$ basket list nose
nose 1.1.1
nose 1.1.2</pre>
        <p>
          You may update only a particular package or a set of
          packages:
        </p>
        <pre>
$ basket update Jinja2
Jinja2 is already up to date (2.6).
$ basket update nose coverage
coverage is already up to date (3.5.2).
nose is already up to date (1.1.2).</pre>
        <p>
          Usually, though, you would ask for an update of all
          downloaded packages:
        </p>
        <pre>
$ basket update
Babel is already up to date (0.9.6).
coverage is already up to date (3.5.2).
Jinja2 is already up to date (2.6).
MySQL-python is already up to date (1.2.3).
nose is already up to date (1.1.2).
unittest2 is already up to date (0.5.1).</pre>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          If you wish to keep only the latest version of each package,
          use the <code>prune</code> command:
        </p>
        <pre>
$ basket list nose
nose 1.1.1
nose 1.1.2
$ basket prune nose
Removed nose 1.1.1 (kept 1.1.2).
$ basket list nose
nose 1.1.2</pre>
        <p>You may do the same thing on all downloaded packages:</p>
        <pre>
$ basket prune
Babel has only one version. Nothing to prune.
coverage has only one version. Nothing to prune.
Jinja2 has only one version. Nothing to prune.
MySQL-python has only one version. Nothing to prune.
nose has only one version. Nothing to prune.
unittest2 has only one version. Nothing to prune.</pre>
        <p>
          Of course, it would be wiser to update downloaded packages
          before pruning anything. Otherwise, you may end up keeping
          only your latest <em>downloaded</em> packages instead of the
          latest <em>released</em> packages.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      Obviously, all commands above (except <code>list</code>) require
      an Internet connection. The point of Basket is that if you are
      offline, you can still install your preferred packages from your
      Basket repository:
    </p>
    <pre>
$ easy_install -f ~/.basket -H None pyramid</pre>
    <p>Or if you prefer Pip:</p>
    <pre>
$ pip install --no-index -f file:///path/to/.basket pyramid</pre>
    <p>
      Running Basket without any argument, with wrong arguments or with the
      <code>help</code> command will print an helpful message that
      describes each command.

    <h2 id="limitations-and-features">Limitations and features</h2>
    <p>
      Basket downloads source distributions only. That may or may not
      cause issues for certain packages on certain platforms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Basket cannot download packages that are not hosted on
      PyPI. Note that a package may appear on PyPI while its files are
      hosted somewhere else. In this case, <code>easy_install</code>
      and <code>pip</code> go a long way to find the files (by
      following links and parsing HTML pages). Basket, on the other
      hand, does not do that and act as if the package was not on
      PyPI.
    </p>
    <p>
      When looking at requirements, Basket only cares about the name
      of the package, ignoring any particular version requirements
      (e.g. "nose&gt;=1.1.2") and thus always downloading the
      latest version. This may be a problem for packages that
      explictly require a version that is not the latest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, Basket downloads optional requirements. This is a feature.

    <h2>Development and license</h2>
    <p>
      Basket is hosted
      <a href="https://github.com/dbaty/basket">on GitHub</a>. Feel
      free to report bugs and contribute there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tests may be run with <a href="http://tox.testrun.org/">Tox</a>,
      which has to be installed first. Unit and integration tests may
      be run with the <code>tox</code> command. Functional tests are a
      lot slower (more than 30 seconds for each Python version) and must
      be run explicitly with <code>tox&nbsp;-e&nbsp;py27-functional</code>
      and <code>tox&nbsp;-e&nbsp;py32-functional</code>.
