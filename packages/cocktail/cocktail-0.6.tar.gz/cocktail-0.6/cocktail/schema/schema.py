    Schemas support inheritance. All members defined by a base schema will be
    reflected on their derived schemas. This is done dynamically: new members
    added to base schemas automatically appear as members of any derived
    schema, recursively. Derived schemas can override member definitions with
    their own, simply adding a new member matching the name of a existing one.

    Schemas can use multiple inheritance; in case of conflicting member
    definitions, the one defined by the foremost base schema (as passed to the
    L{inherit} method) will take precedence.
