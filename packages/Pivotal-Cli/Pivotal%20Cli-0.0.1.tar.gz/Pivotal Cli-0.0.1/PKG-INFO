Description: # pivotalcli
        
        Ever found you want to add a lot of stories for lots of files to
        Pivotal Tracker but found it too much hassle to do by hand? Enter
        `pivotalcli`:
        
            find templates/ -name "*html" | xargs -I {} pivotalcli add {} --labels "templates, todo"
            
        That is it, in a nutshell. 
        
        ## Installation
        
            pip install pivotalcli
        
        ## Configuration
        
        `pivotalcli` looks first for `--token` and `--project` flags. If that
        fails it looks for `PIVOTAL_[TOKEN|PROJECT]` env vars. If
        that also fails, it walks up your file tree until it finds a `.pivotal.json`
        file with `TOKEN` and `PROJECT` keys, eg:
        
            {"PROJECT": "123", "TOKEN": "456"}
