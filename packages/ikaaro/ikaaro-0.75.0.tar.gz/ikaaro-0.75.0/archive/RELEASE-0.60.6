ikaaro 0.60.6 (2009/12/16)
==========================

This is a Content Management System built on Python & itools, among
other features ikaaro provides:

 - content and document management (index&search, metadata, etc.)
 - multilingual user interfaces and content
 - high level modules: wiki, forum, tracker, etc.

The calendar javascript widget has been changed to use dyndatetime [1],
which is based on jquery [2].  Several optimizations have been made to
reduce the size of the javascript files required by ikaaro.

The search-engine-optimization control panel now supports yahoo and
bing.

Many bugs have been fixed, specially in the logic that keeps internal
links up-to-date when moving or renaming resources.
