Python bindings for the Socialtext ReST API
===========================================

This is a client for Socialtext's REST API. The goal of this project is to provide an extensible library that helps you focus on building applications that leverage the power of Socialtext instead of worrying about HTTP methods and status codes.

You will need a user account on a Socialtext appliance to access the API.
