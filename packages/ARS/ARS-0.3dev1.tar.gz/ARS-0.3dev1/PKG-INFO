Description: ARS is a physically-accurate open-source simulation suite for research and
        development of mobile manipulators and, in general, any multi-body system. It
        is modular, easy to learn and use, and can be a valuable tool in the process
        of robot design, in the development of control and reasoning algorithms, as
        well as in teaching and educational activities.
        
        It will encompass a wide range of tools spanning from kinematics and dynamics
        simulation to robot interfacing and control.
        
        The software is implemented in Python integrating the Open Dynamics Engine
        (ODE) and the Visualization Toolkit (VTK).
        
        REQUIREMENTS
