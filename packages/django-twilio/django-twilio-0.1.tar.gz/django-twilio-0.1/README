Purpose
=======

Building telephony applications with Twilio is easy, but not simple.

django-twilio is my attempt at reducing some of the complexities of telephony
development with Twilio--namely, implementing common patterns, helpers, etc., so
that you can truly focus on the core application logic and leave out all the
rest.
