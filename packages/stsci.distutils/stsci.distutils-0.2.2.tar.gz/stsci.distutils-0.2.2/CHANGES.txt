Changelog
===========

0.2.2 (2011-11-09)
------------------

- Fixed check for the issue205 bug on actual setuptools installs; before it
  only worked on distribute.  setuptools has the issue205 bug prior to version
  0.6c10.

- Improved the fix for the issue205 bug, especially on setuptools.
  setuptools, prior to 0.6c10, did not back of sys.modules either before
  sandboxing, which causes serious problems.  In fact, it's so bad that it's
  not enough to add a sys.modules backup to the current sandbox: It's in fact
  necessary to monkeypatch setuptools.sandbox.run_setup so that any subsequent
  calls to it also back up sys.modules.


0.2.1 (2011-09-02)
------------------

- Fixed the dependencies so that setuptools is requirement but 'distribute'
  specifically.  Previously installation could fail if users had plain
  setuptools installed and not distribute

0.2 (2011-08-23)
------------------

- Initial public release
