        FAQ
        ===
        
        **I'm a newbie. Is oh-my-vim made me a Vim guru ?**
        
        No, but it can help you to setup a friendly environment.
        
        After the installation step install some `usefull
        <https://github.com/gawel/oh-my-vim/tree/master/tools/requires/usefull.txt>`_
        plugins with the following::
        
            $ oh-my-vim install -d usefull
        
        Then have a look at the `defaults
        <https://github.com/gawel/oh-my-vim/tree/master/profiles/default.vim>`_ and
        `map <https://github.com/gawel/oh-my-vim/tree/master/profiles/map.vim>`_
        profiles and enable them in your ``.vimrc``
        
        You're now ready to go...!
        
        **What if I already use pathogen ?**
        
        Nothing. Just remove the ``pathogen`` stuff from your ``vimrc``
        
        **Can I use oh-my-vim from Vim ?**
        
        Yes, and you should. You'll get some completion. Just use ``:OhMyVim <args>``
        
        **Can I install a bundle from a mercurial repository ?**
        
        Yes. You just need to prefix your url with ``hg+``::
        
          $ oh-my-vim install hg+https://bitbucket.org/sjl/gundo.vim

        <https://github.com/gawel/oh-my-vim/blob/master/ohmyvim/config.ini>`_
        
        **Does oh-my-vim work on windows ?**
        
        No, it wont be so hard to port but I'm not supporting this OS
        
        **This is a great project. Can I offer you a beer ?**
