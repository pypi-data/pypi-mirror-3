        define possible relations between objects. EEA Relations also comes with a nice,
        customizable faceted navigable popup for relations widget.

        Introduction
        ============
        
        Once installed from "Add-ons", the package will add an utility
        called "Possible relations" under control panel.
        
        
        Main features
        =============
        
        Main goal of EEA Relations is to be an alternative to the default Plone
        related item widget.
        
        EEA Relations features:
        
          1. Define/restrict what kind of content types a certain content can relate to
          2. Set restrictions on possible relations (e.g. relations can be made
             only with published content)
          3. You can define easy to use faceted searches (using EEA Faceted navigation)
             on the relate items popup
          4. Nice visual diagram showning all the relations and restrictions you defined
             (Control pane -> Possible relations)
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        The easiest way to get eea.relations support in Plone 4 using this package is to
        work with installations based on `zc.buildout`_.  Other types of installations
        should also be possible, but might turn out to be somewhat tricky.
        
        To get started you will simply need to add the package to your "eggs" and
        "zcml" sections, run buildout, restart your Plone instance and install the
        "eea.relations" package using the quick-installer or via the "Add-on
        Products" section in "Site Setup".
        
          .. _`zc.buildout`: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zc.buildout/
        
        You can download a sample buildout at:

        Getting started
        ===============
        
        Once you install the package from control panel "Add-ons", the package will add
        an utility called "Possible relations" under control panel from where you can start
        define the relations, the constraints between contents etc.
