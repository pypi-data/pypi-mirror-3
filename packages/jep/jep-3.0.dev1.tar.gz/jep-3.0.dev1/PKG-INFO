Description: Jep - Java Embedded Python
        ===========================
        
        Jep embeds CPython in Java. It is safe to use in a heavily threaded
        environment, it is quite fast and its stability is a main feature and
        goal.
        
        Some benefits of CPython over Java-based languages:
        
        * Using the native Python interpreter may be much faster.
        
        * Python is mature and well supported, so there's no fear the
          interpreter will suddenly change widely-used features.
        
        * Access to the high quality Python modules, both native and
          Python-based.
        
        * Compilers and assorted Python tools are as mature as the language.
        
        * Python is an ideal language for your business logic. It is easy to
          learn, readable and generally immune to programming gotchas.
        
        Patches, comments and other help is greatly appreciated. If you need
        help, post to the `SourceForge mailing list <http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_name=jepp-users>`_
        or forums. Please include code snippets for the most accurate
        response.

        Dependencies
        ------------
        * Python version >= 2.6
        * JNI >= 1.4
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Simply run ``pip install jep``.
        
        *Building on Mac OS X*
        
        OS X requires the `Java Developer Package and Xcode
        <http://developer.apple.com/java/>`_ from Apple. They are free to download.
        
        *Windows*
        
        You'll need to use the same compiler that your Python is built
        with. That's usually MSVC.
        
        Note that Oracle is now building Java with a MSVCRT version that is
        not easily linked with using tools that I have. Using native modules
        on Windows has not worked in recent years because the compilers are
        not widely available. If an OpenJDK build used MinGW, that'd be
        much more likely to work.
        
        Running on \*nix
        -----------------
        Due to some (common) difficulties with Java and C projects
        that dlopen libraries, you may need to set LD_PRELOAD environment
        variable. That's in addition to setting LD_LIBRARY_PATH if you've
        installed libjep into a directory not cached by ld.so.
        
        For example, my Tomcat startup.sh script starts with this:
        
        ::
        
            #!/bin/sh
            # force system to load python
            export LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/libpython2.7.so
            
            # this is where my libjep.so is.
            export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib
        
        The libpython used here is whatever you've compiled jep against. If
        you don't know, try this command:
        
        ::
        
            $ ldd /usr/local/lib/libjep.so | grep python
                /usr/lib/libpython2.7.so (0x00007f74adfbd000)
        
        That's the libpython you want to set in LD_PRELOAD.
        
        Running the tests
        -----------------
        
        The tests are run from setup.py:
        
        ::
        
            $ python setup.py test
        
        Running scripts
        ---------------
        
        There is a ``jep`` shell script to make launching Java and Python a little easier.
        
        ::
        
            $ jep
            >>> from java.lang import System
            >>> System.out.println('hello, world')
            hello, world
            >>>
