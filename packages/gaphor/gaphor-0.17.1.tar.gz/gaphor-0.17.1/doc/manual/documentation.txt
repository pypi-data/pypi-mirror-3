Documentation
=============


  ''The source is the documentation.''

Well, not for us.

Currently, there's not a lot of documentation though. For those of you interested in Gaphor there's

 * A manual_. It outlines some of the ideas in and behind Gaphor.
 * The Tech section contains some interesting articles about the technology that drives Gaphor and Gaphas, Gaphor's canvas widget.
 * We're working on a `new manual`_.

If you're into writing plug-ins for Gaphor you should have a look at our fabulous [source:/gaphor-plugins/gaphor.plugins.helloworld Hello world] plug-in.

External links
==============

 * You should definitely check out http://www.agilemodeling.com.
    * The `UML diagrams <http://www.agilemodeling.com/essays/umlDiagrams.htm>`_ (although Gaphor does not see it that black-and-white).
    * http://www.agilemodeling.com/essays/
 * The `official UML metamodel specification <http://www.omg.org/technology/documents/modeling_spec_catalog.htm#UML>`_. This ''is'' our data model.

Odds and ends
=============

* A somewhat older document about [wiki:Documentation/GtkWin32 how to get GTK+ with Python bindings working on Win32].
