Description: # righteous! : Python RightScale API client
        
        **righteous!** is a Python client implementation of the [RightScale API](http://support.rightscale.com/15-References/RightScale_API_Reference_Guide/02-Management/02-Servers) for EC2 instance management.

        righteous provides an API to create, start/stop, delete, remove and introspect RightScale EC2 Servers.
        This library implements RightScale API 1.0 and has only been tested with EC2 instances using ServerTemplates and managed in a Deployment.
        
        ### Installation
        
        Get it from pypi (like it's hot):
        
            pip install righteous
        
        ### API Usage
        
        First, initialise righteous (to access read-only functionality, you just need to provide the following authentication parameters):
        
        ```python
        import righteous
        username, password = 'me@domain.com', 'security'
        # find your RightScale account_id by going to Settings -> Account Settings in the RightScale Dashboard
        # The URL that is shown in your browser's location bar should look like the following: https://my.rightscale.com/accounts/1234.
        account_id = 1234
        righteous.init(username, password, account_id)
        
        # list servers
        servers = righteous.list_servers()
        ```
        
        ### CLI Usage
        
        Configure the CLI by copying righteous.config.template to ~/.righteous
        and customise appropriately
        
        List all the instances
        
            $ righteous -l
            
        Status of a single instance
        
            $ righteous -s my-instance
        
        Stop an instance
        
            $ righteous -k my-instance
        
        See all the options
        
            $ righteous -h
        
        ### Development / Running the tests
        
            $ pip install -r requirements.txt
            $ testify tests.unit
            $ testify tests.integration 
        
        The integration tests take a couple of  minutes to run since they tests all the current functionality (creating, starting, stopping, deleting environments)
        against RightScale.  These tests require a configured righteous.config in the root of the directory (copy and customise righteous.config.template)
