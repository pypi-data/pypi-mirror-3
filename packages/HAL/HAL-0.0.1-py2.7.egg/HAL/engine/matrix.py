#This file is based on Jon Skeet facts

#HELLO WORLD
Said Hello to World.

#FIRST JON SKEET
Jon Skeet's first words are "Let there be light" apparently.

#NAME ANONYMOUS METHOD
Anonymous methods and anonymous types are really all called Jon Skeet. They just don't like to boast.

#JON SKEET CODING CONVENTION
Jon Skeet's code doesn't follow a coding convention. It is the coding convention.

#BOTTLENECK PERFORMANCE
Jon Skeet doesn't have performance bottlenecks. He just makes the universe wait its turn.

#ACCEPT JON SKEET
Users don't mark Jon Skeet's answers as accepted. The universe accepts them out of a sense of truth and justice.

#DIVIDE ZERO
Jon Skeet and only Jon Skeet can divide by zero.

#JON SKEET FAIL COMPILE
When Jon Skeet's code fails to compile the compiler apologises.

#JON SKEET NULL
When Jon Skeet points to null, null quakes in fear.
