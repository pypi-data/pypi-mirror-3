INI File
--------

Kotti is configured using an INI configuration file.  The
:ref:`installation` section explains how to get hold of a sample
configuration file.  The ``[app:main]`` section in it might look like
this:

.. code-block:: ini

  [app:main]
  use = egg:Kotti
  pyramid.reload_templates = true
  pyramid.debug_authorization = false
  pyramid.debug_notfound = false
  pyramid.debug_routematch = false
  pyramid.debug_templates = true
  pyramid.default_locale_name = en
  pyramid.includes = pyramid_debugtoolbar
                     pyramid_tm
  mail.default_sender = yourname@yourhost
  sqlalchemy.url = sqlite:///%(here)s/Kotti.db
  kotti.site_title = Kotti
  kotti.secret = changethis1

Various aspects of your site can be changed right here.

Overview of settings

This table provides an overview of available settings.  All these

===========================  ===================================================

Only the settings in bold letters required.  The rest has defaults.

kotti.secret and kotti.secret2
------------------------------

The value of ``kotti.secret`` will define the initial password of the
``admin`` user.  This is the initial user that Kotti creates in the
user database.  So if you put *mysecret* here, use *mysecret* as the
password when you log in as ``admin``.  You may then change the
``admin`` user's password through the web interface.

The ``kotti.secret`` token is also used for signing browser session
cookies.

The ``kotti.secret2`` token is used for signing the password reset
token.

Here's an example.  Make sure you use different values though!

.. code-block:: ini

  kotti.secret = myadminspassword
  kotti.secret2 = $2a$12$VVpW/i1MA2wUUIUHwY6v8O

Adjusting the look & feel with ``kotti.override_assets``
--------------------------------------------------------

In your settings file, set ``kotti.override_assets`` to a list of
*asset specifications*.  This allows you to set up a directory in your
package that will mirror Kotti's own and that allows you to override
Kotti's templates, CSS files and images on a case by case basis.

As an example, image that we wanted to override Kotti's master layout
template.  Inside the Kotti source, the layout template is at
``kotti/templates/view/master.pt``.  To override this, we would add a
directory to our own package called ``kotti-overrides`` and therein
put our own version of the template so that the full path to our own
custom template is
``mypackage/kotti-overrides/templates/view/master.pt``.

We can then register our ``kotti-overrides`` directory by use of the
``kotti.asset_overrides`` setting, like so:

.. code-block:: ini

  kotti.asset_overrides = mypackage:kotti-overrides/

Using add-ons
-------------

Add-ons will usually include in their installation instructions which
settings one should modify to activate them.  Configuration settings
that are used to activate add-ons are:

- ``kotti.includes``
- ``kotti.available_types``
- ``kotti.base_includes``
- ``kotti.configurators``

.. _kotti.includes:

kotti.includes
``````````````

``kotti.includes`` defines a list of hooks that will be called by
Kotti when it starts up.  This gives the opportunity to third party
packages to add registrations to the :ref:`Pyramid Configurator API`
in order to configure views and more.

As an example, we'll add the `kotti_twitter`_ extension to add a
Twitter profile widget to the right column of all pages.  First we
install the package from PyPI:

.. code-block:: bash

  bin/pip install kotti_twitter

Then we activate the add-on in our site by editing the
``kotti.includes`` setting in the ``[app:main]`` section of our INI
file.  (If a line with ``kotti.includes`` does not exist, add it.)

.. code-block:: ini

  kotti.includes = kotti_twitter.include_profile_widget

kotti_twitter also asks us to configure the Twitter widget itself, so
we add some more lines right where we were:

.. code-block:: ini

  kotti_twitter.profile_widget.user = dnouri
  kotti_twitter.profile_widget.loop = true

The order in which the includes are listed matters.  For example, when
you add two slots on the right hand side, the order in which you list
them here will control the order in which they will appear.

With this configuration, the search widget is displayed on top of the
profile widget:

.. code-block:: ini

  kotti.includes =
      kotti_twitter.include_search_widget
      kotti_twitter.include_profile_widget

.. _kotti.available_types:

kotti.available_types
`````````````````````

The ``kotti.available_types`` setting defines the list of content
types available.  The default configuration here is:

.. code-block:: ini

  kotti.available_types = kotti.resources.Document kotti.resources.File

An example that removes ``File`` and adds two content types:

.. code-block:: ini

  kotti.available_types =
      kotti.resources.Document
      kotti_calendar.resources.Calendar
      kotti_calendar.resources.Event

Configuring authentication and authorization
--------------------------------------------

You can override the authentication and authorization policy that
Kotti uses.  By default, Kotti uses these factories:

.. code-block:: ini

  kotti.authn_policy_factory = kotti.authtkt_factory
  kotti.authz_policy_factory = kotti.acl_factory

These settings correspond to
`pyramid.authentication.AuthTktAuthenticationPolicy`_ and
`pyramid.authorization.ACLAuthorizationPolicy`_ being used.

Sessions
--------

The ``kotti.session_factory`` configuration variable allows the
overriding of the default session factory.  By default, Kotti uses
``pyramid_beaker`` for sessions.
