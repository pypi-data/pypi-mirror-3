Description: Products.SimpleCalendar is a simple, accessible display-only
        calendaring solution for Plone.  It was created to ensure that a
        simple, accessible (table-based listing) calendaring solution exists,
        and is a viable alternative to p4a.plonecalendar.
        
        In many ways it is similar to p4a.plonecalendar, as it makes use of
        the dateable.chronos and dateable.kalends code as well, and also
        depends on some p4a code, a dependency that was discovered when
        developing Products.SimpleCalendar.
        
        An alpha release for now, using hacks and adapter goodies to get
        things working.  Enjoy.  :)
