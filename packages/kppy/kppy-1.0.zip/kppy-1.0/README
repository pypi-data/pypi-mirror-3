WARNING:
--------

Due to the design of Python it is not possible to create a module that is as
secure as KeePass/KeePassX itself. As long as the database is opened with this
module, the password is saved as plain text in RAM. The problem is that even if
the database was closed correctly it is possible that the password lies
somewhere in your computer's RAM, it's not possible to prevent this in Python.
That is, if your computer is compromised it is possible to dump the password
from memory. But if your computer is really compromised it is also possible to
get your password if you're using KeePass/KeePassX, although it's more
difficult.
