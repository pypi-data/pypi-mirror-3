Description: ========
        Remember
        ========
        
        Remember is a full implementation of the default Plone member
        configuration using content to represent the members, built on top of
        Membrane.  Out of the box, Remember should work very much like a
        regular Plone site, except that member information is stored in Member
        objects that are (by default) stored in the portal_memberdata tool.
        
        Remember is a successor to CMFMember, which will not work with
        PluggableAuthService-based user folders, and thus will not work with a
        typical Plone 2.5 (and greater) installation.  There is a migration
        path provided for folks with existing CMFMember-based sites who would
        like to migration to Plone 2.5.X and Remember.  For instructions on
        performing such migrations, please refer to the README.txt file in
        the cmfmember subdirectory.
        
        NOTE: This version of Remember requires Plone 3; it does NOT support
        Plone 2.5 or Plone 4.  If you have a CMFMember-based Plone 2.1
        solution, you should initially migrate to Remember 1.0 and Plone 2.5.
        Once this is working correctly, then you can upgrade to Remember 1.1
        and Plone 3 with little problem.

        ============
        INSTALLATION
        ============
        
        Remember is packaged using Python's setuptools package management
        infrastructure.  Remember can be made available to your Zope instance
        by installing the Products.remember package into your Zope's python
        environment, using either easy_install or 'python setup.py install'.
        
        Remember is installed into a Plone site by the application of a
        GenericSetup extension profile.  You can do this when creating a new
        site by selecting remember from the list of available setup profiles
        when you are creating the site.  In an existing site, you can use
        Plone's regular product installation interface.
