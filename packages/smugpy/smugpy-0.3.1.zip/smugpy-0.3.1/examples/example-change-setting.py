"""
Example of how to change a setting on multiple albums.

Finds a set of albums (in this example, the match is based on Category name)
and changes an attribute (in this example, the 'Public' property is examined and changed).

Uses smugpy by Chris Hoffman: https://github.com/chrishoffman/smugpy

This example finds all albums in the 'Sports' category and shows how to
display and change the 'Public' attribute.

Uses the old SmugMug API (1.2.2) because it's not worth the effort of using
new style authentication (OAuth) for a one-shot script.

You will need to obtain an API Key from SmugMug to use this script:

Example of information for a single album (returned by albums_get):

{u'Category': {u'Name': u'Events', u'id': 11},
 u'Key': u'xyzzy',
 u'SubCategory': {u'Name': u'Holidays', u'id': 987654},
 u'Title': u'2000-01-01 New Years Eve Party',
 u'id': 1234567}

# display the matching albums
for album in matches:

    print "%s - %s" % (info['Album']['Public'], album['Title'])

# uncomment the code below to change all matching albums

## THIS OPERATION WILL CHANGE THE ATTRIBUTES OF ALL MATCHING ALBUMS.
## USE WITH CAUTION!
