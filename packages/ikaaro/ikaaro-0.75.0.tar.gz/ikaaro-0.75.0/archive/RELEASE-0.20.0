ikaaro 0.20.0 (2007/12/31)
==========================

This is a Content Management System built on Python & itools, among
other features ikaaro provides:

 - content and document management (index&search, metadata, etc.)
 - multilingual user interfaces and content
 - high level modules: wiki, forum, tracker, etc.

This is the first release of ikaaro as a separate package (before it
was distributed as a sub-package of the "itools" [1] library).

From a functional and visual point of view, the changes of this release
are modest:

 - Now we have a friendlier user interface to manage multilingual web
   pages.

 - Following the W3C recommendations [2], type extensions have been
   drop from the URI, so for example "http://.../index.html" becomes
   "http://.../index".

However, the most important changes concern the architecture and the
programming interface, and are strongly related to the changes in the
latest itools version.

This is the (new) architecture diagram:

 4) The Content Management System (ikaaro)
 -----------------------------------------------------------------
 2) File Handlers & Database (itools.handlers)  | 3) Web Framework
 ---------------------------------------------- |    (itools.web)
 1) Virtual File System (itools.vfs)            | 

Summarizing: now the distinction between the different layers is
cleaner.

Another important change from the architecture point of view, we have
decentralized three different aspects:

 - the definition of the fields to be indexed

 - the definition of the metadata fields

 - the upgrade logic

Before these three aspects were defined globally, now they are centered
on the objects.  This means, for instance, that now it should be much
more easy to develop third-party modules.

Please check the upgrade notes for a more detailed description of what
has changed.
