quintagroup.portlet.cumulus is a Plone product that allows you to add tag cloud
portlets to your Plone site. Your site's tags (content categories are used as 
tags) are displayed using a Flash movie that rotates them in 3D. It works just 
like a regular tags cloud, but is more visually exciting. This is the WordPress 
WP-Cumulus plugin ported to Plone as a portlet.

When you add this portlet anywhere in the site it will display all site's tags. 
If you have installed QuillsEnabled product this portlet will display only blog's 
tags when rendered inside blog.
