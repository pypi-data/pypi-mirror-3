PyTTY
=====

Installing
----------

Install this package using distutils:
# python setup.py build
# sudo python setup.py install

See the distutils documentation or help for more options.


Purpose
-------
I created PyTTY because PySerial/etc are not available for Python 3.
While it would be good to get these older packages upgraded for newer
Python releases, PyTTY is intended to be cleaner and use more of
Python's standard library than older serial packages.


Limitations
-----------
PyTTY currently only works on posix systems such as BSD, Linux, and OSX.
Windows support will be added when someone who cares enough about it sits
down for 4 hours to write it.


Help
----
Use pydoc for more information on using pytty.
