        How does it works
        -----------------
        
        ::
        
                                  _______________
                                 /               \
                                 |               |
                          ------>| NETWORKCACHED |
                          |  ----|               |<-----
                          |  |   \_______________/     |
                GET /key  |  |                         |
                          |  | File                    | PUT / <- data
                        __|__v______             ______|_____
                       |            |           |            |
                       |   Client   |           |   Client   |
                       |____________|           |____________|
        
        
        Basically, the networkcached archives the files through HTTP PUT method.
        When a client want to download the file it just need to provide the key
        value and the server will send a response with the file data.
        
        ::
        
          API:
           PUT / : 
             parameter: file uploaded 
             Used to upload/modify an entry
        
           GET /<key>
             Return raw content
             Raise HTTP error (404) if key does not exist
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        ::
        
          $ python2.6 setup.py install
        
        Now it is time to create the 'networkcached.conf' file in /etc/networkcached.conf
        directory, using your preferred text editor (gedit, kate, vim.).
        Follow text shall be put in this file::
        
          [networkcached]
          host = 127.0.0.1
          port = 5001
          cache_base_folder = /var/cache/networkcached/
        
        Run the server::
        
          # networkcached networkcached.conf
        
        
        Setup Develoment Environment
        ----------------------------
        
        ::
        
          $ mkdir -p ~/networkcached/downloads
          $ cd ~/networkcached
        
        Now it is time to create 'buildout.cfg' file in ~/networkcached directory,
        using your preferred text editor (gedit, kate, vim.).
        Follow text shall be put in this file::
        
          [buildout]
          extensions = mr.developer
          auto-checkout = slapos.tool.networkcached
          download-cache = /nexedi/buildout-networkcached/downloads
          eggs-directory = /nexedi/buildout-networkcached/eggs
        
          parts =
           networkcached
        
          [sources]
          slapos.tool.networkcached = svn https://svn.erp5.org/repos/vifib/trunk/utils/slapos.tool.networkcached
        
          [networkcached]
          recipe = zc.recipe.egg
          eggs = 
            slapos.tool.networkcached
        
        Now you bootstrap the buildout::
        
          $ python -S -c 'import urllib;print urllib.urlopen(\
               "http://svn.zope.org/*checkout*/zc.buildout/trunk/bootstrap/bootstrap.py"\
               ).read()' | python -S -
        
        Run the buildout::
        
          $ bin/buildout -v
        
        Now it is time to create the 'networkcached.conf' file in ~/networkcached
        directory, using your preferred text editor (gedit, kate, vim.).
        Follow text shall be put in this file::
        
          [networkcached]
          host = 127.0.0.1
          port = 5001
          cache_base_folder = ~/networkcached/networkcached-database
        
        Now you can start your networkcached server:
        $ bin/networkcached networkcached.conf
        or 
        $ bin/networkcached -d networkcached-database -a 127.0.0.1 -p 5002
