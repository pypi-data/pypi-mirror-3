        Introduction
        ============
        
        collective.zestreleaser.aftercheckoutaction allows to execute any
        shell action after a clean tag checkout has been done. The command
        is executed in the context of hte checkout directory.
        Some variables in the command string can be substituted:
        
         - name
           The package name
         - version
           The package version of the checkout
        
        Commands can be written into ~/.pypirc, the section name must be
        collective.zestreleaser.aftercheckoutaction.
        The variable name is used to match the action against a package.
        For each variable, this plugin compares the package name against
        the variable name. If the variable name matches the beginning
        of the package name, the action is executed. If multiple variable
        name match, the longest variable name wins.
        
        cza is a bit similar to gocept.zestreleaser.customupload.
        While gza lets you upload the finished egg to a predefined location,
        cza lets you do something with the clean checkout. Cza is intended to
        be used if company policy demands that each released version of company
        code must be committed to a company versioning system, but where the
        actual development happens somewhere else. You should NOT use this
        plugin to change something in the checkout, this would result in an
        egg release that has different contents than what is in the source
        repository
        
        Example
        =======
        Add this to your local `~/.pypirc`::
        
            [collective.zestreleaser.aftercheckoutaction]
            collective.zestreleaser.aftercheckoutaction=svn import svn+ssh://do3cc@svn.zope.org/repos/main/Sandbox/do3cc/%(name)s/tags/%(version)s -m "Automatic commit"
        
        This would execute an action for the package collective.zestreleaser.aftercheckoutaction.
