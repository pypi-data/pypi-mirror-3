Description: # sqla_mixins
        
        A python module that contains a number of simple declarative sqlalchemy mixins.
        Currently it supports two such mixins:
        
        * BasicBase
        
          The BasicBase class can be used either as a mixin or simple as the base class
          for all of your sqlalchemy classes. This mixin automatically provides the
          tablename for the class, as well as two columns, `id` and `created_at`.
        
        * UserMixin
        
          The UserMixin class is great for storring username and password information
          into a database. It provides automatic password salting and hashing through
          the recommended [PBKDF2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2) key derivation
          function.
