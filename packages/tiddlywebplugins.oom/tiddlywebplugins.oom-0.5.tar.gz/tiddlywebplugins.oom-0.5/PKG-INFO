Description: 
        This is a TiddlyWeb plugin which extends the TiddlyWeb filter syntax 
        to add 'oom' (One Of Many) which matches if the named attribute is any
        of those named in the provided list. It is similar to
        tiddlywebplugins.mselect but only matches the named attribute against
        many values, not many possible attributes.
        
        This will return all tiddlers with tag blog or published (or both) and
        then sort by modified:
        
            oom=tag:blog,published;sort=-modified
