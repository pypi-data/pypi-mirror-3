Description: 
        ``Pdfposter`` can be used to create a large poster by building it from
        multple pages and/or printing it on large media. It expects as input a
        PDF file, normally printing on a single page. The output is again a
        PDF file, maybe containing multiple pages together building the
        poster.
        The input page will be scaled to obtain the desired size.
        
        This is much like ``poster`` does for Postscript files, but working
        with PDF. Since sometimes poster does not like your files converted
        from PDF. :-) Indeed ``pdfposter`` was inspired by ``poster``.
