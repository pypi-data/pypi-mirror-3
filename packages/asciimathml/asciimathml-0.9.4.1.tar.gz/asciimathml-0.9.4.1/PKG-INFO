Description: Translates from ASCIIMathML (an easy to type and highly readable way to
        represent math formulas) into Presentation MathML (a w3c standard directly
        displayable by some web browsers).
        
        The MathML tree is represented by Elements from the standard
        xml.etree.ElementTree python library.
        
        The obtained tree can then be further manipulated and then serialized into a
        string to be included for example in a HTML document.
        
        Also included is a markdown extension that allows the use of ASCIIMathML,
        eclosed between $$, inside markdown documents.
