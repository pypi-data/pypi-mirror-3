        OOPS Tools
        ==========
        
        This is a Django application to analyze OOPS reports
        (see https://launchpad.net/python-oops).
        
        Please see https://dev.launchpad.net/LazrStyleGuide and
        https://dev.launchpad.net/Hacking for how to develop in this
        package.
        
        Dependencies
        ============
        
        OOPStools uses buildout for configuration.
        
        All dependencies (except for the database packages) are available from the
        lazr-source-dependencies branch on Launchpad. Simply typing make will set-up
        the download-cache of dependencies eggs and then create the buildout.
        
        If you already have that shared eggs cache branch available locally (to share
        between branches of the Lazr project), simply set the LAZR_SOURCEDEPS_DIR to
        the directory containing the download-cache and eggs directories before
        invoking make.
        
        To run under apache with mod_wsgi (recommended)
        
            * libapache2-mod-wsgi package
        
        To run under apache with mod_python
        
            * libapache2-mod-python package
        
        Deployment using mod_wsgi
        =========================
        
        Create a custom cfg file - start with production.cfg and take a copy. Update
        your copy with your database configuration and the paths to your OOPS
        directories:
        
        [configuration]
        db-name = /path/to/your/oops.db
        index-template = 'index.html'
        oopsdir = /path/where/rsynced/oopses/are/found
            /another/such/path
        
        Update settings.py setting a custom SECRET_KEY
        
        To deploy oops tools make sure all the dependecies are installed.
        
         * bin/buildout -c yourfilename.cfg
        
         * Run bin/django syncdb
        
         * Run bin/django migrate
        
         * Copy apache/oops-tools.dev.mod_wsgi to /etc/apache2/sites-available/
        
        AMQP Integration
        ================
        
        The script bin/amqp2disk is an AMQP handler that will receive OOPS reports over
        AMQP and publish them locally to disk as well as loading the metadata directly
        into the oops-tools database. To use this you will need to config your OOPS
        creation to publish over AMQP. If you are using Python then the oops-amqp
        module will help you do this.
        
        Running locally
        ===============
        
        Sometimes Launchpad developers want to run oops-tools to help analyse locally
        generated OOPS reports.
        
        The first step is to setup the local database.
        
        Local PostgreSQL setup
        ++++++++++++++++++++++
        
        If you do Launchpad development, you probably have PostgreSQL already running
        on port 5432. You'll need another cluster to run the oops-tools database.
        
        Create a new cluster for lpoops:
        
            $ LC_ALL=C sudo pg_createcluster 8.4 lpoops --encoding UNICODE --port 5433
        
        Apply the following patch to /etc/postgresql/8.4/lpoops/pg_hba.conf. Note that
        this configuration change needs to be before the "DO NOT DISABLE!" line in the
        pg_hba.conf file.
        
            sudo patch /etc/postgresql/8.4/lpoops/pg_hba.conf <<'EOF'
            --- pg_hba.conf 2005-11-02 17:33:08.000000000 -0800
            +++ /tmp/pg_hba.conf    2005-11-03 07:32:46.932400423 -0800

            +host    all         all         127.0.0.1/32      trust
        
        
            EOF
        
        In case localhost is using IPv6, you'll need an extra line just below the one above.
        
            host    all         all         ::1/128               trust
        
        Start the cluster.
        
            $ sudo pg_ctlcluster 8.4 lpoops start
        
        Add your own user to the cluster:
        
            $ sudo -u postgres /usr/lib/postgresql/8.4/bin/createuser -a -d $USER --port
            5433
        
        To create the new db:
        
            $ createuser lpoops --createdb --no-superuser --no-createrole --port 5433
            $ createdb -O lpoops lpoops --host localhost --port 5433
        
        Note that this command creates a password-less database. Use --password to
        create a db with a password.
        
        To delete the db:
        
            $ dropdb lpoops --port 5433
            $ dropuser lpoops --port 5433
        
        Configuration changes
        +++++++++++++++++++++
        
        If you used a different port than 5433 for the PostgreSQL setup, pass the
        DBPORT variable to make and it'll build the configuration files using the
        value provided.
        
         * `make DBPORT=$PORT`
         * Run bin/django syncdb
         * Run bin/django migrate
         * `make run` at the root of the oops-tools directory
         * Point your browser to http://localhost:8000/oops

        NEXT
        ====
        
        0.6.1
        =====
        
        * Added AMQP support via the bin/amqp2disk script. (Robert Collins)
        
        * Bumped oops-amqp rev to 0.0.3 for bugfixes. (Robert Collins)
        
        * amqp2disk now creates a fanout exchange if --bind-to is supplied.
          (Robert Collins)
        
        * amqp2disk -v will print the received OOPS ids on the console, for
          entertainment and delight. (Robert Collins)
        
        * OOPS reports with non-ascii URL values are handled by url escaping the URL
          bytestring (this is separate to handling of unicode URL values).
          (Roman Yepishev, Robert Collins, #881400)
        
        * OOPS reports with unicode URL values are now handled during oops loading: the
          unicode string is utf8 encoded (an arbitrary choice) and url escaped.
          (Robert Collins, #879309)
        
        * OOPS reports with no topic (formerlly called pageid) will no longer use their
          url instead. Rather '' is used, and reports will show Unknown for empty
          pageids. (Robert Collins, #880641)
        
        0.6
        ===
        
        * Initial release
        
        * Add dependency on testtools and fixtures for cleaner tests.
        
        * Fix race conditions with oops loading and non-sequential oopses. These can
          occur when e.g. rsync is writing at the same time as oops loading, or if a
          non-sequential publisher is used. (Robert Collins, #667373)
        
        * Update to oops-datedir-repo 0.0.7 and add reading of bson serialized oopses
          (which are more extensible and more easily parsed). (Robert Collins)
