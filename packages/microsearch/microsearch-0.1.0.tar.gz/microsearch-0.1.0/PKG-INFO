Description: ===========
        microsearch
        ===========
        
        
        A small search library.
        
        Primarily intended to be a learning tool to teach the fundamentals of search.
        
        Useful for embedding into Python apps where you don't want/need something
        as complex as Lucene.
        
        
        Requirements
        ============
        
        * Python 2.6+ or Python 3.2+
        * (Optional) simplejson
        * (Optional) unittest2 (Python 2.6 - for runnning the tests)
        
        
        Running Tests
        =============
        
        With a source checkout, run:
        
        In Python 2:
        
            python -m unittest2 tests
        
        In Python 3:
        
            python -m unittest tests
        
        Tests should be passing at all times under both Python 2.7 & Python 3.2.
        
        
        Contributions
        =============
        
        If you wish to contribute to improving ``microsearch``, the code you submit
        must:
        
        * Be your own work & BSD-licensed
        * Include a working fix/feature
        * Follow the existing style of the codebase
        * Include passing test coverage of the new code
        * If it's user-facing, must include documentation
        
        Other submissions are welcome, but won't get merged until all of these
        requirements are met.
