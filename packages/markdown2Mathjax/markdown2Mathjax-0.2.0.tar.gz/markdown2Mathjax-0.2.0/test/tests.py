#Some simple test strings.
test='This is a test string with \\$ some escaped $2+3$ and some non-escaped $\\$$ characters.  I hope we can find a pattern to work on this \\$$\\$ ugly$ bitch.  We had better include some $$ double $ like this $$ as well just in case.'
dtest="""This one will start off with some dobule $$ 2+4$ = 3$$, just to make shit diffiult."""
