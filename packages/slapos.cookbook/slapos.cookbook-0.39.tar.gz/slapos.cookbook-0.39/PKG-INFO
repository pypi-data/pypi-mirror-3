        Introduction
        ------------
        
        The erp5.recipe.kvm aims to integrate KVM setups and buildout. This recipe is 
        able to download one remote image and setup a KVM environment to use it. 
        
        This recipe is also capable to reuse images or partitions already present on
        disk to create the setup. 
        
        Examples
        --------
        
        The follow examples lists different kind of configurations.

        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        ::
        
            [kvm-testing-with-remote-gzip-image]
            image = http://URL/public.mdv2010.0_x86_64.qcow2.img.gz
        
            # md5 checks are optional
            md5_download = adcff8adcff8adcff8adcff8
            md5_image = 1a4e371a4e371a4e371a4e371a4e37
        
            gzip = true
            
            # Use -hda instead -drive arg
            # Default is drive (see Options bellow)
            image_type = hda
        
            ### Common Configuration bellow. ###
            
            # VNC is optional
            kvm_vnc = <SOME-IP>:<VNC-DISPLAY>
        
            # Graphic is optional
            kvm_graphic = std
        
            
            # Define list of redirections.
            kvm_redir =
              tcp:13480::80
            
            kvm_net =
              user,hostname=publicmandriva
              nic,model=ne2k_pci
        
            # This automatically create a redirection for 13456 -> 22
            ssh_port = 13456
            ssh_key_path = /path/to/mykey.key
        
        KVM with Remote and raw Image
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        ::
        
            [kvm-testing-with-remote-raw-image]
            image = http://URL/public.mdv2010.0_x86_64.qcow2.img
            md5_download = 1a4e371a4e371a4e371a4e371a4e37
            md5_image = 1a4e371a4e371a4e371a4e371a4e37
        
            gzip = false
        
            ### The Rest Same configuration as previous ###
        
        KVM with direct local Image file
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        This does not copy and/or download the image::
        
            [kvm-testing-with-local-image]
        
            file = /home/you/public.mdv2010.0_x86_64.qcow2.img
            md5_image = 1a4e371a4e371a4e371a4e371a4e37
        
            ### The Rest Same configuration as previous ###
        
        KVM with a linux partition
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        This does not copy and/or download the image::
        
            [kvm-testing-a-linux-partition]
        
            file = /dev/sdb
        
            ### The Rest Same configuration as previous ###
        
        
        Options
        -------
        
        
        location
        
          When define, it does not use buildout parts directory to allocate the image.
        
        image
        
          URL to a remote image. 
        
        file 
        
          Use file makes recipe ignore image option. You can define a path to a image
          or partion to use. 
        
        image_type 
        
          You can define how the KVM will use the image with "-hdx" or "-drive". By
          default it uses drive and the result is:
        
            "kvm -drive file=IMAGE,if=virtio,cache=none,boot=on ..."
        
          if you use image_type=hda:
             
            "kvm -hda IMAGE ..." 
        
        gzip
        
          If true means the image is compressed (gzipped), and the recipe will
          uncompress the image before copy it.
        
        md5_download
        
          When defined, this values is used to verify the file downloaded.
        
        md5_image
        
          When defined, this values is used to verify the image generated, don't use it
          when a partition is used in file parameter.
        
        kvm_vnc
        
          Define the ip-address:display used by KVM to start the VNC server. If not
          defined, no VNC port is created.
        
        kvm_redir
        
          Define port redirections to the buildout.
        
        kvm_graphic
        
          If defined it adds the "-vga value" at the KVM command.
        
        kvm_net
        
          Define the net definitions, each value defines one "-net" in kvm command.
          Example:
          
            kvm_net =
              user,hostname=publicmandriva
              nic,model=ne2k_pci
        
          It generates:
        
            "kvm -net user,hostname=publicmandriva -net  nic,model=ne2k_pci ..."
        
        kvm_snapshot 
        
          Use "-snapshot" when run a KVM. This not write the changes direct into the
          image. Default value is False.
        
        ssh_port
        
          If defined creates a new redirection for port 22 and creates few script to
          connect to the instance.
        
        ssh_hostname
        
          By default it uses localhost. You don't need to define this.
        
        ssh_key_path
        
          Path to the ssh key used to connect without password to the image running.
          
        ssh_user
        
          Define the server that will be used to connect to the instance. 
        
        kvm_bin_directory
        
          Place where the scripts will be created. By default it uses bin-directory from
          buildout.
        
        kvm_run_directory
        
           Place where the pid file will be created, by default it uses var-directory
           from buildout.
        
        
        Generated Commands
        ------------------

        lamp
        =====
        
        The lamp recipe helps you to deploy simply a php based application on slapos. This recipe is 
        able to setup mariadb, apache and apache-php for your php application, and is also capable of
        configuring your software during installation to ensure a full compatibility.
        
        
        How to use?
        -----------
        
        just add this part in your software.cfg to use the lamp.simple module
        
        [instance-recipe]
        egg = slapos.cookbook
        module = lamp.simple
        
        you also need to extend lamp.cfg
        
        extends =
          http://git.erp5.org/gitweb/slapos.git/blob_plain/refs/tags/slapos-0.50:/stack/lamp.cfg
        
        
        lamp.runner
        =====
        
        When you install some software (such as prestashop) you need to remove or rename folder, with slapos you can not 
        access to the www-data directory. to do this, you need to tell to lamp recipe to remove or/and it when software 
        will be instantiated. Some software requires more than rename or delete a folder (manualy create database etc...)
        in this case you need to write a python script and lamp recipe must run it when installing your software.
        
        
        
        How to use?
        -----------
        
        this part of lamp recipe work with slapos.toolbox, Therefore you must add it to your recipe.
        in software.cfg, replace instance-recipe-egg part by
        
        [instance-recipe-egg]
        recipe = zc.recipe.egg
        python = python2.7
        eggs =
            ${mysql-python:egg}
            ${instance-recipe:egg}
            slapos.toolbox[lampconfigure]
        
        and add into your instance.cfg
        
        lampconfigure_directory = ${buildout:bin-directory}/lampconfigure
        
        
        CONDITION
        --------
        
        the action (delete, rename, script, chmod) only starts when the condition is filled.
        in instance.cfg, add 
        
        file_token = path_of_file
        
        and the action will begin when path_of_www-data/path_of_file will be created
        you can also use database to check condition. add 
        
        table_name = name_of_table
        constraint = sql_where_condition
        
        name_of_table is the full or partial name(in some cases we can not know the prefix used to create tables) of table
        into mariadb databse for example table_name = admin. if you use
        name_of_table = **, the action will begin when database is ready. 
        constraint is the sql_condition to use when search entry into name_of_table for example constraint = `admin_id`=1
        
        you can't use file_token and table_name at the same time, otherwise file_token will be used in priority. Beware of conditions that will never be satisfied.
        
        
        
        ACTION
        -------
        The action starts when condition is true
        1- delete file or folder
        into instance.cfg, use 
        
        delete = file_or_folder1, file_or_folder2, file_or_folder3 ...
        
        for example delete = admin 
        
        2- rename file or folder
        into instance.cfg, use 
        
        rename_chmod = mode (optional)
        rename = old_name1 => new_name1, old_name2 => new_name2, ... 
        
        you can also use
        rename = old_name1, old_name2 => new_name2, ... in this case old_name1 will be rename and the new name will be chose
        by joining old_name1 and mysql_user: this should give 
        rename = old_name1 => old_name1-mysql_user, old_name2 => new_name2, ...
        use rename_chmod to apply a mode to new_name1, new_name2, ...
        
        3- Change mode of file or directory
        
        this is usefull if you want to change the mode of files into your www-data, use 
        
        chmod = file1, file2, ....
        mode = mode_to_apply (ex= 0644)
        
        4- Launch python script
        
        use script = ${configure-script:location}/${configure-script:filename} into instance.cfg, add part configure-script
        into software.cfg
        
        parts = configure-script
        
        [configure-script]
        recipe = hexagonit.recipe.download
        location = ${buildout:parts-directory}/${:_buildout_section_name_}
        url = url_of_script_name.py
        filename = script_name.py
        download-only = True
        
        The script_name.py should contain a main function, sys.argv is given to the main. you can write script_name.py like this
        ....
        def setup(args):
            mysql_port, mysql_host, mysql_user, mysql_password, mysql_database, base_url, htdocs = args
            .......
        
        if __name__ == '__main__':
            setup(sys.argv[1:])
        
        base_url: is the url of php software
        htdocs: is the path of www-data directory
        mysql_user, mysql_password, mysql_database, mysql_host: is the mariadb parameters
        you can also use "import MySQLdb" if you want to access to database via your python script
        
        libcloud
        ========
        
        Slapified recipe to interact with any libcloud supported IaaS system

        librecipe
        =========
        
        Thanks to using slapos.cookbook:librecipe it is easier to create zc.buildout recipes in SlapOS environment.
        
        How to use?
        -----------
        
        In setup.py of recipe add only one install requires to slap.lib.recipe.
        
        In code itself subclass from slap.lib.recipe.BaseSlapRecipe.BaseSlapRecipe.
        
        Use _install hook:
        
        ::
        
          from slap.lib.recipe.BaseSlapRecipe import BaseSlapRecipe
        
          class Recipe(BaseSlapRecipe):
            ...
            def _install(self):
              # refer below for list of available objects
              specific code
              of recipe
        
        Available variables self.:
        
         * name and options passed by zc.buildout during init
         * work_directory -- buildout's directory
         * bin_directory -- places for generated binaries
         * running_wrapper_location -- filename of wrapper to create
         * data_root_directory -- directory container for data -- inside this
           directory it is advised to create named directories for provided servers
           which needs data
         * backup_directory -- directory container for backups -- inside this
           directory it is advised o created named directories for backups, with same
           structure as in data_root_directory
         * var_directory -- container for various, unix following things:
        
           * log_directory -- container for logs
           * run_directory -- container for pidfiles and sockets
        
         * etc_directory -- place to put named files and directories of configuration
           for provided servers
         * computer_id -- id of computer
         * computer_partition_id -- if of computer partition
         * server_url - url of Vifib server
         * software_release_url -- url of software release being instantiated
         * slap -- initialised connection to Vifib server
         * computer_partition -- initialised connection to computer partition
         * request -- shortcut to computer partition request method
        
        By default all directories are created before calling _install hook.
        
        _install method shall return list of paths which are safe to be removed by
        buildout during part uninstallation.
        
        Important assumptions
        ---------------------
        
        Because in SlapOS environment zc.buildout does not know when data are changed,
        recipes shall be always uninstalled/installed. This is done during constructing
        recipe instance which subclasses from BaseSlapRecipe.
        
        
        memcached
        =========
        
        Instantiates Memcached instance.

        mkdirectory loops on its options and create the directory joined
        
        .. Note::
        
           Use a slash ``/`` as directory separator. Don't use system dependent separator.
           The slash will be parsed and replace by the operating system right separator.
        
           Only use relative directory to the buildout root directory.
        
        The created directory won't be added to path list.
