Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        Press Room is a simple add-on product which can be used to easily manage an
        online Press Room within your Plone site.  It adds 4 new content types to your
        Plone site including a Press Release, a Press Clip (i.e. an outside news
        piece), and a Press Contact (someone who might be available to speak to the
        press.)
        
        It also provides a Press Room, a folderish content type with a nice default
        view and some automatically created folders and Collections (aka Smart Folders)
        to help you organize and present your press materials.
        
        Some press rooms we observed in making this product are found at microsoft.com,
        intel.com, nrdc.org, sierraclub.org, and google.com.  Our goal was to make
        something suitable for many kinds of organizations, including nonprofits,
        businesses, educational institutions, and more.

        Current Status of Press Room
        ============================
        
        This release of PressRoom has been tested with Plone 2.5.5, Plone 3.3.2, and
        Plone 4.0b1. We assume it will work for most Plone releases 2.5 through 4.0b1.
        If you have a Plone 2.1 site, please see the PressRoom 1.1 line.  We are
        committed to supporting the two most current Plone releases at a time.
        
        Known bugs and issues are listed at http://plone.org/products/pressroom/issues
        
        Suggestions welcome!  (Code even more welcome!)
        
        Roadmap: http://plone.org/products/pressroom/roadmap
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Install in the usual way, by:
        
         * Adding the Products.PressRoom egg to your buildout
         * Browse to your plone site --> site setup --> add/remove products
         * Click install (or you can use the QuickInstaller tool in the Zope Management Interface)
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        We recommend creating a Press Room object in the root of your site.
        Then begin creating Press Releases, Press Clips and Press Contacts in your
        Press Room.  
         
        The "Add Press (item)" links in the Press Room will shortcut you to subfolders
        intended to store these items.  Only items stored in their appropriate
        subfolder will be shown in the Press Room view.
         
        You may create Press Releases, Clips and Contacts elsewhere in your site, but
        these will not be shown in the Press Room view.
         
        You might find it useful to suppress the ability to add normal News Items if
        Press Room replaces that need.  You can do that by going into the portal_types
        tool in the ZMI and unchecking "implicitly addable" for News Items.
        
        Note that in Plone 3.0+, the infrastructure supporting each Press Room by
        default is created as "private".  The Press Room provides a button to publish
        all of these.  That button will NOT publish any actual Releases, Clips or
        Contacts -- just the folders that contain them and the Collections that
        aggregate them.
        
        Upgrading Folders
        =================
        
        As of Press Room 3.2, the containers for Press Clips and Press Releases are
        Large Plone Folders. Before 3.2, Press Room used normal folders, which become
        inefficient when containing more than about a hundred items.  To upgrade an
        older Press Room, navigate to the Press Room and append "/@@upgrade-folders" to
        the url. A message will return with the results of the upgrade. Note that your
        Press Room subfolders must retain their original ids ('press-clips' and
        'press-releases') in order to be upgraded.
        
        Note also that, by default, Large Plone Folders are not normally addable in a
        Plone site. To allow the creation of the two used in a new Press Room, we
        briefly enable them (if they weren't already) and after adding them, we disable
        them again. That means that attempts to rename them will cause a cryptic error
        about disallowed types. To get around that, simply navigate to portal_types in
        the ZMI, click into Large Plone Folders, and check the "Implicitly addable"
        checkbox.
        
        In Plone 4, standard folders are BTree-based and can better handle large numbers
        of items, so Large Plone Folders are no longer used.  Folders that were already
        upgraded to Large Plone Folders in Plone 3 can remain that way.

         - Switched to Large Plone Folders for storing Press Releases and Clips. Provided
           a migration script for upgrading older Press Rooms. (This was Roadmap
           item #3.) [jbaldivieso]

         - Made CSS not conditional on pressroom types (it was hard to style pressroom
           subfolders, which aren't custom types; also it's more efficient to have that
           readily combinable with other stylesheets in the Resource Registry) [jonstahl]
        
        3.1
         - Added basque translation [erral]
         - Fixed an upgrade error (issue #42) and the i18n coverage in pressroom_view (issue #43).
         - Added a cell phone field to press contacts. Enhanced the way they are displayed throughout the
           Press Room (issue #11). Also Press Contacts can be downloaded as vCards for use in address
           books/email clients. [jbaldivieso]
        
        3.0
         - moved pressroom_view logic into view [jbaldivieso]
         - bifurcated the pressroom_content skin directory into 2.5 and 3.0 versions to
           support KSS in 3.0 sites [jbaldivieso]
         - moved as much of the initialization into GenericSetup as possible, without sacrificing
           normal quickinstaller-based installation in Plone 2.5. [jbaldivieso]
         - created a workaround for PressRooms created using the new Simple Publication WF.
           Users are warned if the releases/clips/contacts folders are private, and a button
           is provided to publish the pressroom, the three subfolders, and their respective
           Collections. [jbaldivieso]
        
        1.1
         - Italian translation file [rlemmi - thanks!]
         - Corrected help text on press clip publication [jonstahl]
         - Moved press clip description above byline [jonstahl]

           contacts folder [jonstahl]

           in the Press room default subfolder titles and descriptions
         - added i18n in pressroom domain, added Czech translation [naro - thanks!]
         - removed condition on pressroom_folder_listing that prevented bylines from being
           shown to anonymous users [jonstahl]
         - added i18n tags to page templates [jonstahl]
        
        1.0.3
         - Changed the id on the created press contact smart folder from "roster" to "press-contacts"
           due to the former being a reserver id within the context of a member folder.  Fixes issue
           #26 [andrewb]
         - Changing some tests that were based on the assumption that we were ordering catalog results
           on effective rather than the more logical storydate and releaseDate schema fields [andrewb]
         - Adding test coverage to prove that a storydate and releaseDate *should* be required on the
           PressRelease & PressClip content types due to the sorting that's done in the default
           catalog queries [andrewb]
         - Making storydate and releaseDate required fields within the schema declaration per the
           testing coverage in the previous line [andrewb]
         - The "More press clips/release" text only shows up when there actually *are* more of
           those items [andrewb]
         - Removed trailing slashes in links from main press room and press room subfolder views [jonstahl]
         - Added | between email and phone number for press contacts [jonstahl]
         - Spam-protected email adddress of press contacts [jonstahl]
         - Changed CSS selector for press contacts from #press-contacts to #press-contacts-box to
           resolve conflict with auto-generated listing in folder_contents [jonstahl]
        
        1.0.2
         - Fixed a missing global define.  [jonstahl]
        
        1.0.1
         - Fixed dumb tab issue. [jonstahl]
        
        1.0 final 
         - Fixed smart folder index fields to include getReleaseDate and getStoryDate
        
        1.0 beta
         - Subclassed ATFolder instead of OrderedBaseFolder so that display menu works properly [jonstahl]
         - Added views for clip, release, contact folders [burbank]
        
        0.8.1
         - Resolved compatibility issues with LinguaPlone and PressRoom due to subclassing of
           i18N-unaware type for the PressRoom type
        
        0.8 
         - Initial release to plone.org products area (CHANGES regime not in place so do the following:   
           "svn diff --verbose -r 23865:27132" against the collective repository to determine what
           has changed)
        
        0.1 
         - Initial release and migration to Collective
