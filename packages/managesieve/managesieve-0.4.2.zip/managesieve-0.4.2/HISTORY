Version XXX by Hartmut Goebel <h.goebel at crazy-compilers.com>
--------------------------------------------------------------------
:sieveshell:
  - Added option --port, thanks to Damien Aumaitre submitting for the
    patch.
  - Added option --verbose for controling debug output in managesieve.
    May be given several times to increase verbosity.

:managesieve:
  - Switched to Python standard logging system.
    This introduces a minor interface change: MANAGESIEVE.debug and
    global Debug are gone. See source for information about debuging
    log levels.


Version 0.4.2 by Hartmut Goebel <h.goebel at crazy-compilers.com>
--------------------------------------------------------------------
:managesieve:
  - Use ssl.wrap_socket() instead of deprecated socket.ssl().
    Thanks to Guido Berhoerster for submitting the patch.

Version 0.4.1 by Hartmut Goebel <h.goebel at crazy-compilers.com>
--------------------------------------------------------------------
:managesieve:
  - fixed short read (thanks to paurkedal for submitting the patch)


Version 0.4 by Hartmut Goebel <h.goebel at crazy-compilers.com>
--------------------------------------------------------------------
:managesieve:
  - now work with Python 2.3 and later
  - added support for TLS (STARTTLS), special thanks to Gregory Boyce
    for fixing some corner cases here
  - added support for PLAIN authentication
  - use optparse if available instead of optik.
  - API change: login() no longer uses the LOGIN authentication
    mechanism, but has become a  convenience function. It uses the best
    mechanism available for authenticating the user.

  Bugfixes:
  - If a capability had no values (like 'STARTTLS'), parsing
    capabilities failed. Fixed.
  - removed dependency on some imaplib's private functions
  - fixed typo: self.supports_tls

  Thanks to Tomas 'Skitta' Lindroos, Lorenzo Boccaccia, Alain Spineux,
  darkness and Gregory Boyce for sending patches.

:sieveshell:
  - added support for different authentication mechanisms
  - added option --start-tls
  - more verbose output when server says "BYE" (prints out referrals
    etc.)
  - automatic cmd_quit() when server says "BYE"
  - several minor bugfixes and enhancements


Version 0.3 by Hartmut Goebel <h.goebel at crazy-compilers.com>
--------------------------------------------------------------------
:managesieve:
  - MANAGESIEVE.authenticate() now only returns a OK/NO/BYE result
    like any command not asking data from the server

:sieveshell:
  - added 'edit', which may create scripts, too. (posix only)
  - now prints out the server capabilities, thus the user knows what
    the server is capable of (and which Sieve-Commands may be used).
  - fixed some minor bugs

--------------------------------------------------------------------
