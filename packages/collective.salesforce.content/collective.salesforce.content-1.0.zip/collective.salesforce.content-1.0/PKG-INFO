Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        ``collective.salesforce.content`` provides a Dexterity behavior for setting up
        Plone Dexterity content types that are connected to objects in a Salesforce.com
        database. Arbitrary schema fields can be mapped and updated periodically based on
        automatic queries to Salesforce.
        
        This is currently an integrator-level package with minimal UI. As consultants,
        we have used this functionality as a foundation for solving use cases like:
        
        * Expose a member directory on a public Plone website based on Account or Contact
          records pulled from Salesforce.com each night.
        
        * Provide browseable and searchable tables of arbitrary data whose
          canonical storage is in Salesforce.com.
        
        * In conjunction with ``dexterity.membrane``, allow users represented in
          Salesforce.com to log in to a Plone site, with appropriate roles based on their
          status in Salesforce.com.
        
        * Pull pricing records from Salesforce as a basis for charging the correct amount
          in online transactions on the Plone website.
