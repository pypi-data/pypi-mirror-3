Description: Drawsomething
        =============
        
        Help you guess drawsomething words by brute force all permutations.
        
        Depends
        -------
        
        - pyenchant
        - google-translate
        
        Install Guide
        -------------
        
        Take OS X for example.
        
        Drawsomething depends on enchant to do spell checking.
        
        As pyenchant is only a python binding for enchant, we need to install enchant first. And we also need to install aspell with en dict because enchant use aspell as backend.
        
        ::
        
            $ brew install aspell --lang=en
            $ brew install enchant
            $ pip install pyenchant google-translate
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        One line script to generate all possible words:
        
        ::
        
            >>> import drawsomething
            >>> drawsomething.get_words('esttxyz', 4)
            ['ttys', 'sexy', 'yest', 'text', 'sett', 'zest', 'stet', 'test']
        
        
        To list words with translations:
        
        ::
        
            >>> import drawsomething
            >>> words = drawsomething.get_words('esttxyz', 4)
            >>> for w in words:
            >>>     trans = drawsomething.translate(w, 'zh_cn').lower()
            >>>     print w, trans
        
        
        The `drawsth` is a cli script to list all possible words:
        
        ::
        
            $ drawsth -l 4 -c esttxyz
            ttys
            sexy
            yest
            text
            sett
            zest
            stet
            test
