Some general Remarks
=====================

Theano offers quite a bit of flexibility, but has some limitations too.
How should you write your algorithm to make the most of what Theano can do?

Limitations
-----------

- While- or for-Loops within an expression graph are supported, but only via
  the :func:`theano.scan` op (which puts restrictions on how the loop body can
  interact with the rest of the graph).

- Neither ``goto`` nor recursion is supported or planned within expression graphs.
