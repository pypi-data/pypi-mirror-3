Description: =================
        Custom egg upload
        =================
        
        This package provides a plugin for ``zest.releaser`` that offers to upload the
        released egg via SCP or HTTP PUT (WebDAV) to a custom location (instead of or
        in addition to PyPI).
        
        To use, add a section to your ``~/.pypirc`` like the following::
        
            [gocept.zestreleaser.customupload]
            gocept = scp://download.gocept.com:/var/www/packages
            gocept.special = http://dav.gocept.com/special
        
        If the package being released starts with one of the keys in that section
        (longest match wins, case insensitive), you will be prompted whether to upload
        the egg (that was created by zest.releaser by checking out the tag) to the
        given server.
