Vizing -- list-colouring of graphs in Python 
============================================

Vizing is a collection of Python code for working with list-colouring problems. List vertex-colourings and list edge-colourings are both of interest here. With Vizing you can easily build a variety of models of a list colouring problem instances and use solvers to find realisations of your models. 

Visualisations in LaTeX are provided via ``tkz-graph``.
