        About sparkblocks
        -----------------
        ``sparkblocks`` is a Python module that provides a single function, ``spark()`` which takes a list of numbers (ints or floats) and outputs a string containing a unicode character (9601-9608) sparklines bargraph representation of the numbers.
        
        It is based on the `spark tool <https://github.com/holman/spark>`_ by Zach Holman, and the original `Twitter sparkline generator <http://www.datadrivenconsulting.com/2010/06/twitter-sparkline-generator/>`_ by Alex Kerin.
