Dalimil todo

Clarify provided compression versions
-------------------------------------
Currently, some compression methods are mentioned, but not supported.

Review, which methods are really worth to implement (probably only tar and targz)

Optional 7-zip support
----------------------
So far, no reliable 7-zip Python lib was found.

Consider supporting this compression by simply callint 7-zip command line tool directyl.

.. warning:: 7-zip can consume quite some resourcing while compressing, be careful not to get your
   server down to its knees as I did.

Complete unittest
-----------------
Currently, unit tests just do some call of dalimil, but do not check any results.

Checks shall be added.
