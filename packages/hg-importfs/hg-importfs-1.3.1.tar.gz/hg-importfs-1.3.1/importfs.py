    Imports a set of files from a given file-system into a Mercurial

    the repository as it is.

    The specified repository is created if it doesn't exist. It is updated to
    the specified parent revision or null.

    If the repository is updated to a revision other than "tip" the new
    revision is created on a new branch. If the branch option is used the
    branch has the given name. Otherwise the name "default" is used.

    The files in the working directory are deleted and the files from the
    source directories are copied into the working directory. If a file exists
    in more than one source directory the file in the rightmost directory wins.
    "hg addremove" with the specified similarity is executed. "hg commit" with
    the specified message is executed. If a tag is specified, "hg tag" with the
    name is executed.

    If the import is done in Windows, symbolic links are dereferenced
    - that is, replaced by a copy of the linked file or directory. If the
    import is done in Unix, symbolic links are imported as Unix symbolic
    links (i.e. not dereferenced).

    All files and directories matching the exclude pattern will be ignored. If
    you want to use more than one pattern use the --exclude-pattern option
    several times. The following example will copy everything except .pyc files
    and files or directories whose name starts with tmp.

    $ hg importfs repo source --exclude-pattern *.pyc --exclude-pattern tmp

    The --exclude-path option takes an exact path as value. The result is that
    the files in the path are not imported. The option can be used several
    times for different paths. The path is specified relative to SOURCE.

    Using the --retain-empty-dirs option will create a new file, .empty, during
    the import when a empty directory is encountered so that the directory is
    added to the repository. This is executed after the contents of the SOURCE
    are determined (e.g. after the exclude options are applied).
