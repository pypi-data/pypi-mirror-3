Responsive Design Patterns
---------------------------
Responsive design implies that your site looks different on different devices (desktop,table,phone). 
Traditionally, you deal with this by using the visibility classes to reveal or hide content or collape 
or expand the layout. 
Instead, *responsive design patterns* allow you to plan how your sites are going to react on various display types and resolutions.
We have also included CSS to support
