.. rubric:: A networked data structures manager design to work with Redis_
  data-store, but implemented so that other storage systems can be supported
  in the future.
  
  
It is shipped with an object-data mapper which greatly facilitates the
management and retrieval of large data-sets.
It includes a stand-alone, ``python 3`` compatible,
:ref:`redis client <redis-client>` which was originally forked from redis-py_.
There are no dependencies, it requires ``python 2.6`` up to ``python 3.3`` and
there are over 500 tests with a coverage of about 90%.

**The library is stable, used in production and continuously maintained**.

**Dependencies**: None

**Optional Dependencies**: cython_ for the :ref:`Redis C parser <redis-parser>`.
