Description: Bytestag is a peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing system that uses a distributed
        hash table (DHT) to achieve wide availability of files. Unlike the BitTorrent
        protocol, files are published entirely via DHT and do not require trackers
        or swarming. Each computer donates disk space and bandwidth for caching of
        published values.
        
        This software is currently under development.
