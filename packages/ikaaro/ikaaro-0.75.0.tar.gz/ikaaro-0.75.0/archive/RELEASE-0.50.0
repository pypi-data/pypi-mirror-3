ikaaro 0.50.0 (2008/12/19)
==========================

This is a Content Management System built on Python & itools, among
other features ikaaro provides:

 - content and document management (index&search, metadata, etc.)
 - multilingual user interfaces and content
 - high level modules: wiki, forum, tracker, etc.

This release has seen the major changes in the user interface for a
long time.  Most notably the backoffice is now integrated into the
frontoffice.  When the user logs in the application, the backoffice
interfaces appear.

A number of changes have been made to satisfy this new approach.  In
particular the backoffice interfaces are lighter.  For instance the
two level drop down menu has been replaced by a discrete flat menu.
Another example, now the right column, instead of being always visible,
contains context menus that appear or dissappear depending on the
resource & view being displayed.

The internationalization and localization of the user interfaces has
also been considerably improved.  For example now there is a global
language selector, available in both the front and back office modes.
And several components are multilingual now, like the HTML editor
(TinyMCE [1]) and the tracker tables.

Some other features have been added to the issue tracker.  First, a
calendar has been integrated, in order to track resources attached
to an issue.  Another important change, there is a new field called
'Products', and now modules and versions are classified by product
(inspiration from bugzilla [2]).

Many other changes have been made to the user interface, too many to
enumerate them here.

The application behaviour is also more respectful of the REST [3]
paradigm.  For instance now there are much less redirections than
before.

However, it is probably the changes under the hood that are most
important.  Specifically the architecture changes concerning the
way a resource view is built.  Before a view was a resource method,
simple enough but not very scalable.  Now a view is a class in
itself, what enhances the possibilities of code refactoring.

Again, the changes to the programming interface are too many to
enumerate here.  See the upgrade notes for more.
