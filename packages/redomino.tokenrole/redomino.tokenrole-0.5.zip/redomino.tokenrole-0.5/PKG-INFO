        unregistered user through a link.

        users providing a specific token is provided.
        
        After you install redomino.tokenrole through Plone Control Panel, go to
        any Plone Page and activate TokenRole support using the specific
        action in the content actions menu.
        
        A new content tab will appear to let you manage your tokens on that
        page: create a new one leaving there what the system suggests or
        modifying it as you need. Now try to access the provided url with
        an unpriviledged user and you'll get the role you granted on that context.
