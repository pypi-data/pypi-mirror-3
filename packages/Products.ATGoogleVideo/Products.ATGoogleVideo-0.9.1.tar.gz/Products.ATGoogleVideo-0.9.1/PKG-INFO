        Plone site.
        
        **Products.ATGoogleVideo** was initially developed as part of a project to
        create a system for Newspaper Workflow Automation based on the requirements of
        the Mexican newspaper `La Jornada <http://www.jornada.unam.mx/>`_ and on the
        `IPTC News Architecture <http://www.iptc.org/>`_ .
        
        This product has been tested with versions 3 and 4 of Plone.
