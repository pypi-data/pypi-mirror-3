= Get Gaphor running on Windows =

Gaphor even runs on windows. 

  '''NOTE''': The installer is currently broken. For now, use the alternative way as described below (see #128).

Download the installer:

{{{
#!html
<div style="float: left; height: 51px; background: #eeeeee url(/projects/gaphor/attachment/wiki/Images/arrow.png?format=raw) no-repeat top right; margin: 0; padding: 3px 36px 10px 5px; border: 1px outset #DDDDCC">
<a href="http://downloads.sourceforge.net/gaphor/gaphor-0.13.0-py2.5.exe" style="font-size: 26px; font-weight: bold; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif">download<br/><span style="font-size: 11px; padding: 0">windows installer</span></a>
</div>
<br style="clear: both" />
}}}

This installer will download all required files and install them (you should have an internet
connection when running the installer).


----

For those of you that do not trust installers, check out the alternatives below.

== Alternative == 

Another way is to install the [http://osl.ulpgc.es/~arc/gnome/pygtk-setup.exe all-in-one installer] from [http://aruiz.typepad.com/siliconisland/2006/12/allinone_win32_.html Alberto Ruiz]. Running the PyGTK installer with default settings will install Python, GTK+ and PyGTK in {{{C:\Program Files\PyGTK}}}.

After installing Python, PyGTK and the GTK+ runtime environment, you need to install [http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall easy_install]. Download the latest version from the [http://peak.telecommunity.com/dist/ez_setup.py ez_setup.py] (place it in {{{C:\Program Files\PyGTK}}} for example) and run it: Open a command shell (''Start'' -> ''Run...'', type {{{cmd}}} (enter))

{{{
C:\>"c:\Program Files\PyGTK\Python\python.exe" "c:\Program Files\PyGTK\ez_setup.py"
}}}

After installing {{{easy_install}}}, first install [http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zope.interface zope.interface]:

{{{
C:\>"c:\Program Files\PyGTK\Python\Scripts\easy_install.exe" zope.interface==3.3.0
}}}

Here version 3.3.0 is installed (instead of the latest version). This is due to the fact that no binary distribution is available for the latest {{{zope.interface}}} module. No problem. Gaphor will work with an older version of {{{zope.interface}}} too.

After a successful installation of {{{zope.interface}}} Gaphor should be installed by executing:

{{{
C:\>"c:\Program Files\PyGTK\Python\Scripts\easy_install.exe" gaphor
}}}

Now you should be able to start Gaphor my executing {{{c:\Program Files\PyGTK\Python\Scripts\gaphor.py}}}. This work from within the explorer.


If you're a developer and already have Python 2.4 installed you can, as an alternative, check out the {{{gaphor-win32-libs}}} module from Gaphors subversion repository or download the zip file from http://svn.devjavu.com/gaphor/gaphor-win32-libs/zips/gaphor-win32-libs.zip. Follow the instructions in the {{{README.txt}}} file.


== Trouble shooting ==

''You're getting an error message like this:''
{{{
error: Setup script exited with error: Python was built with Visual Studio versi
on 7.1, and extensions need to be built with the same version of the compiler, b
ut it isn't installed.
}}}

This is due to the fact that no binary distribution is available for the latest {{{zope.interface}}} module. Try to install an older version of zope.interface (see above).

''My error is more like this:''
{{{
error: Setup script exited with error: command 'gcc' failed: No such file or directory
}}}

Same reason as described above, you just performed the steps described on CustomInstallationLocation.
