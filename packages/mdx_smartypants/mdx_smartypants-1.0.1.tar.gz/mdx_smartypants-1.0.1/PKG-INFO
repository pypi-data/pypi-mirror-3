Description: 
        
        A Python-Markdown extension that uses smartypants to provide typographically nicer ("curly") quotes, proper ("em" and "en") dashes, etc.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Use::
        
            pip install mdx_smartypants
            
        Or::
        
            easy_install mdx_smartypants
            
        (You may need to begin these with "sudo ".)
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        To use::
        
            import markdown
            import mdx_smartypants
            
            md = markdown.Markdown(extensions=['smartypants'])
            
            md_text = """
                This is some Markdown. It's pretty nice, and simple. But--it could
                really use some typographic "prettification." That... That would
                be sweet. Definitely 7---8 on a '10-point scale'.
                
                Huzzah!
            """
        
            print md.convert(md_text)
        
        This produces nice HTML output, including typographically "pretty" quotes and other
        punctuation. It also renders HTML entites in their named rather than numeric form
        for easier-on-the-eyes, more-rapidly-comprehended HTML::
        
            <p>This is some Markdown. It&rsquo;s pretty nice, and simple. But&mdash;it could
            really use some typographic &ldquo;prettification.&rdquo; That&hellip; That would
            be sweet. Definitely 7&ndash;8 on a &lsquo;10-point scale&rsquo;.</p>
            <p>Huzzah!</p>
            
        Which renders as:
        
        .. raw:: html
        
        <p>This is some Markdown. It&rsquo;s pretty nice, and simple. But&mdash;it could
        really use some typographic &ldquo;prettification.&rdquo; That&hellip; That would
        be sweet. Definitely 7&ndash;8 on a &lsquo;10-point scale&rsquo;.</p>
        <p>Huzzah!</p>
