***********************************************************
  HTSQL -- A Query Language for the Accidental Programmer
***********************************************************

HTSQL ("Hyper Text Structured Query Language") is a high-level query
language for relational databases.   The target audience for HTSQL is
the accidental programmer -- one who is not a SQL expert, yet needs a
usable, comprehensive query tool for data access and reporting.  

HTSQL is also a web service which takes a request via HTTP, translates
it into a SQL query, executes the query against a relational database,
and returns the results in a format requested by the user agent (JSON,
CSV, HTML, etc.).

Use of HTSQL with open source databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite) is
royalty free under BSD-style conditions.  Use of HTSQL with proprietary
database systems (Oracle, Microsoft SQL) requires a commercial license.
See ``LICENSE`` for details.

For installation instructions, see ``INSTALL``.  For list of new
features in this release, see ``NEWS``.  HTSQL documentation is in the
``doc`` directory.
