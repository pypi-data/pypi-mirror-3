Description: ===========
        aws.authrss
        ===========
        
        Access your Plone RSS feeds as authenticated user. This feature was inspired by
        `Redmine <http://www.redmine.org/>`_.
        
        Abstract
        ========
        
        Actually, authenticated users in Plone site may read content that are not
        available to anonymous users. But when subscribing to a Plone RSS feed they can
        only view items that are available to anonymous users. Just because the RSS
        readers such as Google Reader do not - and cannot - provide feature to provide
        authentication cookie or header to authenticate on the feed URL.
        
        ``aws.authrss`` gives to the authenticated users a dedicated and private link to
        the Plone RSS feeds. Such feeds provide all elements the user is entitled to
        view, when authenticated in the Plone site with a browser, and of course,
        relevant to the feed (Folder, Collection, ...)
        
        Each user may have a private token he can change whenever he wants in his
        personal preferences. This token is part of the query string of the
        authenticated RSS field, and identifies the user **only** for the RSS feeds.
        
        A control panel for site administrators gives the possibility to prune private
        tokens of removed users.
        
        Plays with
        ==========
        
        Plone 4.1 only as this component is still a baby. Plone 4.0 support should not
        be that difficult (contributors are welcome).
        
        .. admonition::
           Conflicts with...
        
           `collective.blog.feeds <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/collective.blog.feeds>`_
           because both override the same viewlet, and there's no possible conflict
           resolution. Sorry.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Production site
        ---------------
        
        As usual in your ``zc.buildout`` configuration: ::
        
          [instance]
          recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
          ...
          eggs =
              aws.authrss
        
        Development site
        ----------------
        
        The development package at Github comes with a suitable ``buildout.cfg``. See
        `Links`_. You just need to clone that repoitory and play the usual ``python
        bootstrap.py`` + ``bin/buildout``.
        
        In ZMI
        ------
        
        Don't forget to enable syndication in the ``portal_syndication`` object of your
        site, and to check the ``Visible?`` checkbox of the
        ``portal_actions/object/syndication`` action of your site to have the control of
        the per context syndication.
        
        Upgrading
        =========
        
        Available upgrades may be executed from the ``portal_setup`` tool of your Plone
        site in the **Upgrades** tab.
        
        .. admonition::
           No upgrades with alpha releases
        
           For the first alpha versions, we shall not provide upgrade steps. You will
           need to reinstall the component. Stable versions coming after the first
           stable versions will come will all necessary upgrade steps.
        
        Customization
        =============
        
        Integrators
        -----------
        
        ``aws.authrss`` adds the authenticated RSS link with the
        ``portal_actions/document_actions/private_rss`` action in your site. You may
        move this action (cut / paste) anywhere you want, as long as you keep its
        properties unchanged.
        
        You may hide the standard ``portal_action/document_actions/rss`` action that is
        now useless.
        
        Developers
        ----------
        
        ``aws.authrss`` comes with its own tokens manager that stores tokens in an
        ``OOBtree``. See the class ``aws.authrss.tokenmanager.DefaultTokenManager``.
        
        You may provide your own tokens manager registering an utility that implements
        ``aws.authrss.interfaces.ITokenManager`` in your component's
        ``override.zcml``. Then install this local utility using a GenericSetup
        ``componentregistry.xml`` file like this one: ::
        
          <?xml version="1.0"?>
          <componentregistry>
            <utilities>
              <utility
                interface="aws.authrss.interfaces.ITokenManager"
                factory="my.component.tokenmanager.DefaultTokenManager"
               />
            </utilities>
          </componentregistry>

        Planned features
        ================
        
        Do not assign tokens to users authenticated from an user folder that's not in
        the Plone site (i.e a Zope root manager).
        
        Add unit tests to KSS handlers (Any help appreciated).
