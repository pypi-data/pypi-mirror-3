URL:
  http://github.com/vpelletier/python-libusb1

Requirements:
- Python 2.4+ (2.6+ recommended) http://www.python.org/
  Not compatible with Python 3
- ctypes (included in Python 2.5+) http://python.net/crew/theller/ctypes/
- libusb-1.0 http://www.libusb.org/wiki/libusb-1.0

OS:
python-libusb1 is expected to work on any OS supported by libusb. It is known
to be used on:
- Linux
- Windows
- OSX

Contents:
- libusb1.py
  Bare ctype wrapper, inspired from library C header file.
- usb1.py
  Python-ish (classes, exceptions, ...) wrapper around libusb1.py .
  See docstrings (pydoc recommended) for usage.
- setup.py
  To package as python egg.
- stdeb.cfg
  To package as Debian package. See https://github.com/astraw/stdeb .
- testUSB1.py
  Very limited regression test, only testing functions which do not require a
  USB device.

Install:
python setup.py install
(you might need root access to do this)

History:
python-libusb1 was created to get a python wrapper supporting asynchronous
features of libusb1.
0.0.1
  Initial release
0.1.1
  Massive rework of usb1.py, making it more python-ish and fixing some
  memory leaks.
0.1.2
  Deprecate "transfer" constructor parameter to allow instance reuse.
0.1.3
  Some work on isochronous "in" transfers. They don't raise exceptions anymore,
  but data validity and python-induced latency impact weren't properly checked.
