Description: == Introduction ==
        
        This is python-qualysutils. A Python package that provides logic and data
        processing access for the QualysGuard (R) API (v1 and v2). This project is
        Copyright (c) University of Waterloo and licensed under a BSD-new License.
        
        Code in this library builds upon the low-level connection code available in
        the python-qualysconnect package.  See:
        https://bitbucket.org/uWaterloo_IST_ISS/python-qualysconnect
        
        The primary author of this package (to this point) is Colin Bell.

        == Installation ==
        
        $ python setup.py install
        
        NOTE: If you would like to experiment without installing globally, look into 'virtualenv'.
        
        === Requirements ===
        
        You will need lxml installed for XML parsing in qhostinfo.py to work.
        
        * http://lxml.de/
        
        I've only tested this with Python 2.x.  I will need to test it with Python 3.x.
