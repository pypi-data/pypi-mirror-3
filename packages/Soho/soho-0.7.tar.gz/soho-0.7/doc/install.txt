Download and install Soho
=========================

Supposing you have installed `Python`_ and `Docutils`_, you can
install Soho via an egg with ``easy_install`` or from the sources if
you prefer it the old way.

.. _Python: http://python.org

.. _Docutils: http://docutils.sourceforge.net


Install via an egg
------------------

This is the recommended method. Installing via eggs will also install
Soho's requirements for you.

If you need to install ``easy_install``, see `easy_install
installation page`_. If you do not want to bother reading this page,
here is a shorter how-to::

    $ wget http://peak.telecommunity.com/dist/ez_setup.py
    $ python ez_setup.py

Now that you are ready:

1. Make sure that your ``easy_install`` installation is up to date by
   running::

    $ easy_install -U setuptools

2. Then run the following command::

    $ easy_install soho


That's it.

.. _`easy_install installation page`: http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall#installing-easy-install


Install "the old way"
---------------------

If you do not want to use ``easy_install``, you can use the
"traditional" method:

1. Download sources (either from the `tarball`_ or from the `SVN
   repository`_).

2. Run::

    $ python setup.py build

3. And then run (you may need to be a super-user to do that)::

    $ python setup.py install

.. _`tarball`: /soho/files/soho-latest.tar.gz
.. _`SVN repository`: https://svn.noherring.com/code/soho


Test your installation
----------------------

You should now have:

- a new ``soho`` Python library which you can import:

.. sourcecode:: pycon

    >>> import soho

- a ``soho`` program which may or may not be in your path, depending
  on your installation.
