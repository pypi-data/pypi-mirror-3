Description: # Introduction
        
        Butteur is a preprocessor to write beamers slides more easily by allowing you to use a more concise syntax. It was also an excuse for me to learn lex/yacc
        
        # Installation
        
        In a virtualenv or as root:
        
            pip install butteur
        
        You'll need to have the command "pdflatex" available.
        
        # Usage
        
            butteur file.butt
        
        # Example
        
            theme Berlin
            title the title of the document
            author Myself master of the world
        
            slide
                this is the first line
                you don't need to put a blank line between 2 lines
                you can put \emph{raw latex here}
        
            slide this slide has a title
                and some content
