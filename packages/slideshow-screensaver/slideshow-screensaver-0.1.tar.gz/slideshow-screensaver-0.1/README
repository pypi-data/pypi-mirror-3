Slideshow Screensaver v0.1
##########################

Introduction
############

Slideshow Screensaver is a screensaver for Gnome which displays a new photo
every 10 seconds from ``$HOME/Pictures``.  If you want to customize the photo
directory, the time between photos or the screensaver delay you will need to
edit the source code for now.

This is a very simple app which, for now, might not play nicely with
xscreensaver, gnome-screensaver, etc.

Installation
############

1. Install the system-wide dependencies:

	- python 2.7
	- python-gobject (for GObject 3+)
	- dbus-python
	
2. Install the python package: ::

	sudo pip install slideshow-screensaver
	
3. Configure the screensaver to run automatically:

	- Disable any other screensavers.
	- Make ``watch-idle.py`` run at startup.
