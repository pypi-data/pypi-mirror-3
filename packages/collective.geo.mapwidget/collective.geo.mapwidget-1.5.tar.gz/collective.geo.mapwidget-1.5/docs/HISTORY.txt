Changelog
=========

1.5 (2012-02-11)
----------------

- Added French translation [Fabien Moret]

  hitting enter submitted the parent form.
  [davidjb]
- Fix minor typo on geocoder error div
  [davidjb]
- Replace deprecated usage of ``jq`` with ``$`` (using ``jQuery`` function)
  [davidjb]
- Allow mapwidget to utilise HTTPS mapping resources, where possible, to
  attempt to avoid issues of loading insecure resources like map tiles. Only
  Google and Bing support HTTPS for their APIs at present - Yahoo and OSM do
  not. To avoid security errors, avoid the use of the latter two map APIs
  when on HTTPS.
  [davidjb]
- Provide request protocol to layer templates
  [davidjb]
- Make tests install the collective.geo.settings extension profile so
  plone.app.registry knows about settings.
