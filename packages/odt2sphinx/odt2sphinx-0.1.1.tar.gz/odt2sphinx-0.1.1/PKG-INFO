        ==========
        
        What is it ?
        ------------
        
        Odt2sphinx convert OpenDocument Text file(s) to one or several .rst files.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        ::
        
            Usage: 
              odt2sphinx [options] filename.odt [targetdir]
              odt2sphinx [options] config.cfg
        
            config.cfg content:
              [path/to/the/file.odt]
              targetdir = path/to/the/targetdir
        
            Options:
              -h, --help            show this help message and exit
              --debug               
              --download-source-link
        
        Ouput files
        -----------
        
        The files are generated in the target dir, which by default has the 
        same name as the .odt file minus the extension.
        
        At least one file, "index.rst", will be written. Depending on the
        document content, additional rst files may be generated (see next chapter).
        
        Images are extracted and put together in a "images" directory inside
        the targetdir.
        
        Styles mapping
        --------------
        
        The following rules will be applied to particulary styles when converting
        an .odt file. The style names are case-insensitive.
        
        -   "Title" (in any language) : becomes the main document title
            (underlined with '=').
        
        -   "Title 1" : Create a new page named after the title, and becomes this
            page main title (underlined with '='). A reference to this file
            is inserted in a ``.. toctree`` directive of the index.rst file.
        
        -   "Title 2" to "Title 6" : becomes sub-chapter titles.
            (underlined respectively '-', '~', '^', '"', "'")
        
        -   "Warning" (or "Avertissement") : The chapter becomes the content
            of a ``.. warning`` directive
        
        -   "Tip" (or "Trucs & Astuces") : The chapter becomes the content
            of a ``.. tip`` directive
        
        -   "Note": The chapter becomes the content
            of a ``.. note`` directive
