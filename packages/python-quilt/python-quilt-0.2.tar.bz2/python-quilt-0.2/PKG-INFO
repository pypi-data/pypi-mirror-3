Description: python-quilt
        ============
        
        python-quilt is a python_ implementation of the well-known tool quilt_
        to manage a series of patches.
        
        It's intended to be used within a python application or framework but
        also provides a console client interface called pquilt.
        
        python-quilt only requires patch_ and diff_ for creating and applying diffs.
        
        Source code of python-quilt can be found at https://github.com/bjoernricks/python-quilt
        
        Supported quilt commands
        ------------------------
        Currently the following quilt commands have been implemented already
        *(but might still miss some features)*.
        
        - add
        - applied
        - delete
        - edit
        - import
        - new
        - next
        - pop
        - previous
        - push
        - top
        - refresh
        - revert
        - series
        - unapplied
        
        Currently unsupported commands
        ------------------------------
        - diff
        - files
        - header
        - rename
        
        Unlikely to be supported
        ------------------------
        The following quilt commands are unlikely to be implemented either
        because they they don't make much sense in a python package or nobody
        has stepped up to implement its feature.
        
        - annotate
        - fold
        - fork
        - graph
        - grep
        - mail
        - patches
        - setup
        - shell
        - snapshot
