<h3> Introduction</h3>
</center>
<b>WB</b>,
the Web Billboard is a CGI program which can be used to manage "billboards",
i.e.: pages where documents can be posted (and edited, and removed) in a simple
way, without the need to know HTML or how to manage a web site. In this respect
it may be considered a very simple form of Content Management System
which, in turn, is very simple to install and configure.

</a>
<p>
Exactly the same could be done simply by editing HTML files, but <b>WB</b> gives you a few
tools to simplify and speed up the process, namely:
<ul>
<p><li> Documents are added to the billboard via an easy-to-use form. There is no need to know HTML
        or any other formatting language to add a document or to modify it.  Anybody who can do cut&amp;paste
        can add or modify a document.
<p><li> The editing form provides a very simple function to add attachments to any document. Again, you
        don't need to know how to delete files from the web server, or even where they are actually
        stored.
<p><li> When documents are posted to or removed from a billboard, the list of documents is automatically
        updated.
<p><li> Each document has an associated posting date. You can post a document in advance, and it will
        automatically be displayed when the date comes.
<p><li> You may also give an expiration date to the document, and it will disappear when the date comes.
<p><li> You may also get documents to be automatically removed when expired (and related attachments will be removed too).
<p><li> A mail message can be automatically sent to a list of addresses whenever a document is added, or
        modified.
<p><li> Using <b>WB</b> all posted documents will have a consistent layout and aspect.
</ul>

<h4>WB is highly configurable:</h4>
<ul>
<li> Configurable document lists
<li> Configurable document aspect
<li> Multi-language support
</ul>
<h4>What you need to use WB</h4>
<b>WB</b> is a <a href=http://www.w3.org/CGI/>CGI</a> program written in Python. So that you essentially need a
Web server which can run Python programs. WB has been developed and tested with an 
<a href=http://www.apache.org>Apache&nbsp;2</a> based web server running
<a href=http://www.python.org>Python&nbsp;2.3</a>, both on a system
running Solaris 5.8 (SPARC) and on a Linux box (Fedora core 3 distribution).
As long as you can have Apache and Python running 
on your own Web server, you shouldn't have any troubles in running
<b>WB</b> on any Unix-like O.S. or even under Windows (in this latter case, anyway, the user authentication
   mechanism has not been tested and will likely not work properly).

<p>
<b>WB</b> relies on some pieces of information which are provided by the Apache server when running CGI programs.
I have not tested it under other Web servers. If anybody can sucessfully use WB with other brands of Web servers,
please let me know.
