Description: Yak
        ---
        
        Yak is a static blog generator, colloquially known as a blog baking engine.
        
        Quickstart
        ``````````
        
        To get started, run the following command::
            
            yak init
        
        And Yak will build a basic Yak blog structure with a single blog post in the current working directory. Edit the '_config.py' file to configure Yak.
        
        You can now 'bake' a blog from the result of the command above::
        
            yak
        
        Because no arguments are passed, Yak will use the current working directory as the blog source directory and write the baked blog in the '_site' directory.
        
        All you have to do now is just serve the contents of that directory with the web server of your choice.
        
        Usage
        `````
        
        ::
        
            yak [SOURCE_DIR] [OUTPUT_DIR]
        
        If no SOURCE_DIR is passed, the current working directory will be used as the SOURCE_DIR.
        
        If no OUTPUT_DIR is passed, '_site' will be used as the OUTPUT_DIR.
        
        As of the current version, Yak will remove the contents of OUTPUT_DIR before writing the baked blog to OUTPUT_DIR.
