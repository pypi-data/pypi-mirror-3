:Info: An introspective interface for Django and MongoDB.
:Author: Daniel Greenfeld (http://github.com/pydanny)

About
=====
Extracted from http://consumernotebook.com, django-mongonaut is an introspective interface for working with MongoDB via mongoengine. Rather then attempt to staple this functionality into Django's Admin interface, django-mongonaut takes the approach of rolling a new framework from scratch.

By writing it from scratch I get to avoid trying to staple ORM functionality on top of a NoSQL key/value store.
