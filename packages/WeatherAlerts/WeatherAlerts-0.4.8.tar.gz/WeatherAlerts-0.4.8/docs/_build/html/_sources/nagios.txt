Nagios Monitoring 
==================

The example Nagios plugin does work though it needs improvement to add more configuration options. The plugin accepts a list of SAME codes separated by commas, no spaces. I'll post example nagios config files once I get the nws-alerts packaged and available via easy_install/pip. For now, anyone with a bit of nagios experience and python knowledge should be able to get it running in a few minutes.
