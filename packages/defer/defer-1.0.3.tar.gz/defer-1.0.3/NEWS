CHANGES FOR 1.0.3:

  * Add support for Python3. We now require at least Python 2.6

CHANGES FOR 1.0.2:

  * Fix a missing import of the DeferredException

CHANGES FOR 1.0.1:

  * The utils.deferable decorator detects if the decorated function
    was called from an inline_callbacks decorated function. In this
    case a Deferred will be return automatically. There isn't any need
    to specify the defer argument anymore.

  * Fixes:
    - Detection of call of return_value outside of inline_callbacks 


CHANGES FOR 1.0:
 
  - Initial release as a separate package
