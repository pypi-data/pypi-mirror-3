        Introduction
        ============
        
        This library packages `suggest.js`_ for `fanstatic`_.
        
        .. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
        .. _`suggest.js`: http://www.enjoyxstudy.com/javascript/suggest/index.en.html
        
        This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
        and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
        directory in ``js.suggest``) are published to some URL.
        
        
        How to use?
        ===========
        
        
        You can import ``suggest`` from ``js.suggest`` and ``need`` it where you want
        these resources to be included on a page::
        
          >>> from js.suggest import suggest
          >>> suggest.need()
