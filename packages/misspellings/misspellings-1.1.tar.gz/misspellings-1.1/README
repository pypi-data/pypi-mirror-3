This is a Python library and tool to check for misspelled
words in source code.  It does this by looking for words from
a list of common misspellings.  The dictionary it uses to do this
is based on the Wikipedia list of common misspellings.

The list has been slightly modified to remove some changes that cause
a number of false positives.  In particular `ok->OK` was removed (ok is
frequently used in perl tests for instance).

To try it out, merely run the following (using the coreutils
source tree as an example):

    git clone git://git.sv.gnu.org/coreutils ../coreutils
    find ../coreutils -name '*.c' | ./scripts/misspellings -f -
    ../coreutils/src/cat.c[754]: efficency -> "efficiency"
    ../coreutils/src/comm.c[196]: funtion -> "function"
    ../coreutils/src/expr.c[21]: seperate -> "separate"
    ../coreutils/src/pr.c[1416]: accomodate -> "accommodate"
    ../coreutils/src/tac.c[342]: unneccessary -> "unnecessary"
    ../coreutils/src/test.c[97]: supressed -> "suppressed"
