Description: 
        A serialization which provides documentation of the request methods
        and serializations for all the resources available from the current
        TiddlyWeb instance.
        
        That is: for any existing resource if you get it as text/x-tiddlyweb-docs
        this code will automatically generate documentation about this thing.
        
        So, for example http://example.com/bags/foo/tiddlers.x-doc will
        list the serializations and HTTP methods available at that URI.
        
        The motivation for this is to cause lack-of-documentation shame.
        
        Install by adding tiddlywebplugins.docs to system_plugins in
        tiddlywebconfig.py.
