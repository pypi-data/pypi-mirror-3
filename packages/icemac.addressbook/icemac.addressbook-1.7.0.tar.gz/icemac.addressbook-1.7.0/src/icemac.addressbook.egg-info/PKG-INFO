        ==============
         Installation
        ==============
        
        Prerequisites
        =============
        
        You only need Python 2.6.x. (Other python versions are currently
        not supported.)
        
        First installation
        ==================
        
        CAUTION: icemac.addressbook can't be installed using ``easy_install`` or
        ``pip``, you have to follow these simple steps.
        
        Neither you need any root privileges nor it installs anything outside
        its directory.
        
        1. Download the source distribution (see Download_).
        
        2. Extract the downloaded file.
        
        3. Run ``install.py`` using your desired python, e. g.::
        
           $ python2.6 install.py
        
        4. Answer the questions about admin user name, password and so on.
        
        5. Run the tests. See `Run the tests`_
        
        6. Start the application. See `Run the application`_
        
        Update
        ======
        
        - When you are updating from version 0.3.x or earlier follow the steps
          described in `First installation`_ followed by the steps described
          in `Second part of steps for older versions`_.
        
        - When you are updating from version 0.4 or newer follow these steps:
        
           1. Download and extract the source distribution (see Download_) to a
           new a directory.
        
           2. Run ``install.py`` using your desired python added by the path
           to the previous installation. This way values you entered
           previously are used as defaults instead of the application
           defaults.  Example::
        
             $ python2.6 install.py ../icemac.addressbook-0.4
        
           3. Answer the questions about admin user name, password and so on.
        
           4. Start the new instance of the application.
        
        - If you get an error when running the application after updating
          which looks like::
        
            zope.generations.interfaces.UnableToEvolve: (..., u'icemac.addressbook', ...)
        
          Then you have to upgrade to version 0.5.x first and start the
          application, so that legacy data can be converted. Version 1.x is no
          longer compatible with these older versions.
        
        
        Second part of steps for older versions
        ---------------------------------------
        
        1. Stop the old instance of the application.
        
        2. Create a backup of the ZODB og the old instance using::
        
           $ bin/backup
        
        3. Copy the backup directory (``var/backups``) to the new instance.
        
        4. Restore the backup into the new instance using::
        
           $ bin/restore
        
        5. Start the new instance of the application.
        
        Run the tests
        =============
        
        Run the unit tests and functional tests using::
        
          $ bin/test
        
        Run the application
        ===================
        
        To run the application instance in foreground start using::
        
          $ bin/addressbook fg
        
        To run it as a demon process start using::
        
          $ bin/addressbook start
        
        To stop the demon process call::
        
          $ bin/addressbook stop
        
        The default URL is to access the application is::
        
          http://127.0.0.1:8080
        
        To log-in at this URL you need the username and password you chose
        when running ``install.py``. The are stored in ``admin.zcml``.
        
        Create a new address book using the `add address book` link on the
        right. How to create new users inside this address book is described
        in `Create new users`_.
        
        
        Change configuration of the installation
        ========================================
        
        The values you entered during installation resp. update are stored in
        a file named `install.user.ini` in the address book directory.
        
        To change the configuration values call `install.py` using python and
        enter a `.` as parameter like this::
        
          $ python2.6 install.py .
        
        The configuration questions get presented to you with your previously
        entered values as default.
        
        To remove additional packages you have to edit the ``[package]``
        section of `install.user.ini`. There is currently no other way for
        removal.
        
        To remove the user name which should own the process you have to edit the
        ``[server]`` section of `install.user.ini`. Remove the value from the
        ``user`` line.
        
        =================
         User management
        =================
        
        Roles
        =====
        
        Access to the address book is only granted after authentication. There
        are three roles to authorize a user:
        
        - visitor: visit all person's data, search and export, change own
          password
        
        - editor: permissions of visitor + edit all person's data, change own
          log-in name
        
        - administrator: permissions of editor + create and change address
          book and users
        
        Create new users
        ================
        
        Users are persons from the address book augmented by log-in
        information.
        
        To create the first new user inside an address book the adminstrator
        (who was created in `First installation`_) has to log-in and then do
        the following:
        
          1. create a new person with an e-mail address using `Add person`.
        
          2. create a new user using `Master data --> Users --> Add user`.
        
        The newly created user has now a log-in (e-mail address) for the
        address book the person belonges to.

        Longer term
        ===========
        
        The following features might be implemented over the next months:
        
        - person data
        
          * store picture per person
        
        - company as entity

        Change log
        ==========
        
        1.7.0 (2011-11-03)
        ==================
        
        General
        -------
        
        - Dropped support for Python 2.5, so currently only Python 2.6 is supported.
        
        
        UI changes
        ----------
        
        - Previously search results could only be exported. The options have been
          widened, so different handlings of search results are possible. So
          deletion of the selected persons has been moved to these search result
          handlers.
        
        - Added explanation text to search from.
        
        Features
        --------
        
        - Added a new search type: Search for person names. You may use wildcards in
          this search (? for a single character or * for multiple characters).
        
        - Search results now display the columns the user selected in his personal
          preferences.
        
        - Added search result handler to modify a single field on all selected persons
          in the search result. Depending on the kind of the field different operations
          are possible (replace with, append to, remove from, add to, multipy with,
          intersect with, ...). Only users with "Administrator" role can use this
          handler as wrong usage might be dangerous for the data.
        
        
        Bug fixes
        ---------
        
        - Running the address book in a vhost environment did not allow to access the
          about screen, as it was only registered for the root folder.
        
        Other
        -----
        
        - Updated to `Zope Toolkit 1.1`_ for dependent packages.
        
        - Integrated `decorator` package into distribution as needed version is
          prone to disappear from PyPI.
        
        - Changed test setup to use `plone.testing` layer.
        
        .. _`Zope Toolkit 1.1`: http://docs.zope.org/zopetoolkit/releases/overview-1.1.html
        
        
        
        1.6.0 (2011-02-03)
        ==================
        
        Features
        --------
        
        - Added ability to sort the fields of the entities.
        
        Bug fixes
        ---------
        
        - It is no longer possible to add new fields to the 'main adresses and
          numbers' entity as it makes no sense and breaks the address book.
        
        
        1.5.0 (2010-11-23)
        ==================
        
        Features
        --------
        
        - Added support for Python 2.6.
        
        - Added an "about addressbook" view which shows the version number. The blue
          "i" right of "icemac.addressbook" in each view is a link to it.
        
        - Added messages telling about successful actions, e. g. applying or
          canceling a form.
        
        - Made it possible to sort the entities.
        
        - Made 'main adresses and numbers' an entity, so it could be sorted along
          with the other entities.
        
        - Added ability to delete the persons found in a search. User must have the
          administrator role to use this feature as it might be dangerous.
        
        - Added installation option to configure that the address book process sould
          run as another user than the one who started it.
        
        Bug fixes
        ---------
        
        - When copying a person, the creation dates and modification dates of the
          addresses in the copied person are changed along the person.
        
        
        Other changes
        -------------
        
        - Updated to `Zope Toolkit 1.0`_ for dependent packages.
