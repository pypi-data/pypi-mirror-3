        Usage
        -----
        
        Configure your file storage in ``settings.py``::
        
            DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = django_file_storage.config()
        
        Looks for ``DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE`` in your environment variables, and falls
        back to django's default. The environment variable must be one of those defined
        in ``backends``.
