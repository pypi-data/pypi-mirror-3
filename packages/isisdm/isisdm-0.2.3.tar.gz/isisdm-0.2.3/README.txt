ISIS-DM: the ISIS Data Model API

ISIS-DM is an API and tools for:

   1. schema definition through classes, similar to modern OPFs (Object Persistence Frameworks); 

   2. HTML form generation and validation;

   3. conversion of ISIS data to JSON;

In other words, ISIS-DM allows programmers to express constraints and functionality similar to those of the CDS/ISIS Field Definition Table and the CDS/ISIS Formatting Language, but in contemporary, object-oriented programming languages.

The API aims to be database-independent. Objects defined in the ISIS-DM should be easily persisted in CDS/ISIS, CouchDB, MongoDB, Amazon SimpleDB and other semistructured databases.
