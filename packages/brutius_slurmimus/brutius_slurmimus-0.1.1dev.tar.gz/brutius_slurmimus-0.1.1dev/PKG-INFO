Description:  Et tu, brute?  Parsing slurm info the `wrong way`.
        
        This module tries to duplicate some of the functionality of pyslurm but by
        instead running slurm commands (squeue, sinfo) and parsing their output.
        
        Its no cross platform, or secure, or anything.  Its a standin until pyslurm
        supports the 2.2.7 API.
