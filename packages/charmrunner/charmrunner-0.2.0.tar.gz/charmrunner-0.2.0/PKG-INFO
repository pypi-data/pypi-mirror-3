Description: 
        Automated Charm Testing
        -----------------------
        
        Reusable components and utilities for ``juju``:http://juju.ubuntu.com charm testing.
        
        There are several different use cases for testing from jenkins
        waterfall views, to gating publishing to a repository based on test
        results.
        
        In order to accomodate different running scenarios, the tools are
        presented as a set of cli tools.
        
        
        All the tools operate against the default juju environment.
        
        Runner
        ------
        
        Provides the main entry point into charm testing. It will generate and
        run a test and record the result and environment information::
        
           $ juju-graph-runner -r repository -w working_dir -s series -t testrecord.zip <charm_name>
        
        
        Planner
        -------
        
        For a given charm change calculate a series of test plans against a repository
        of all charms::
        
            $ juju-planner -r repository  -s precise -d plans_dir <charm_name>
        
        Snapshot
        --------
        
        Snapshot and restore an environment, akin to a bzr shelve. Primary
        purpose it to be able to clear out services from an environment so the
        environment can be reused across tests.
        
        Operates on a service granularity, destroying and removing old services
        not present in before the last snapshot in a pop::
        
          $ juju-snapshot snapshot -f pristine.json
          $ juju deploy --repository=examples local:mysql
          $ juju-snapshot restore -f pristine.json
        
         - Clean an environment for reuse, via deleting services.
         - Resets provider storage of any uploaded charms.
         - Removes any charm state from zookeeper.
        
        
        Loader
        ------
        
        Load a test plan's services and relations into an environment::
        
          $ juju-load -r repository mediawiki.plan
        
        
        Watch
        -----
        
        Verification for a service coming up correctly, waits for a given
        service and all its relations to reach a completed steady state or any
        reach a failure state::
        
         $ juju-watch <service_name>
        
        Exit code 1 if the wait failed, stderr with more details. Exit 0 if succesful.
        
        Test Records
        ------------
        
        Create an archive of all the unit logs, zookeeper data, status, and
        test runner logs::
        
         $ juju-record -f testrecord.zip
