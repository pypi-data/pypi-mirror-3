Description: A TS to AVI converter written in Python.
        
        TS files are generally produced by TV records from boxes like the freebox
        provided by free.
        
        This script extensively uses mencoder, which is generally provided by an
        mplayer installation! See http://www.mplayerhq.hu for more information.
        As it uses the subpress module, this script is supposed to work with
        python >= 2.6. Please check your local version by a simple ``python -V``.
