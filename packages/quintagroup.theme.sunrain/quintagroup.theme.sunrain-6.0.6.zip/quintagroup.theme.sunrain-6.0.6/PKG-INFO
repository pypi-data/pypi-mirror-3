Description: SunRain free diazo theme for Plone 4.1.
        
        Features
        --------
        
        * SunRain Theme can be presented in two different views: 'Rain' - defined as a default view:
        
        .. figure:: http://quintagroup.com/services/plone-development/skins/images/rain.png/
        
        and 'Sun':
        
        .. figure:: http://quintagroup.com/services/plone-development/skins/images/sun.png/
        
        To change between 'Sun' and 'Rain' views - go to 'Site Setup' -> 'Diazo theme' settings, open 'Advanced settings' tab.
        In 'Parameter expressions' field change ``theme = string:rain`` for ``theme = string:sun`` or vice versa.
        
        * Top image. SunRain diazo theme has replaceable header image for front and inner site pages. To replace default image - upload image with
        ``topimage`` shortname into site root or any site section. Recommended image size: 1000*104px.
        
        * SunRain theme has 'subscribe' viewlet integrated, that adds 4 actions 'Share on Twitter', 'Share on Facebook', 'Send this'
        and 'Subscribe to RSS'. Their links can be edited via ZMI portal_actions -> subscribe.
        
        Icons can be edited via file system at /src/quintagroup.theme.sunrain/quintagroup/theme/sunrain/static/images folder:
        replace twitter.png, facebook.png, rss.png and email.png icons with new ones. Restart instance.
        
        * Slogan. SunRain Theme uses customizable slogan. To change it, go to 'Site Setup' -> 'Diazo theme' settings, open 'Advanced settings' tab.
        In 'Parameter expressions' field change 'Type your slogan here' slogan in ``slogan = context/slogan | string: Type your slogan here`` line.
        
        * Logo. SunRain diazo Theme uses default Plone 4 logo. To replace it - in ZMI customize portal_skins -> sunburst_images -> logo.png image.
        
        * Search Box. New approach to site search display is implemented in this theme: searchSection is hidden during common page
        view. Simply hover the cursor to the search box area and the searchSection appears.
        
        * Improved thumbnail display view (switch to Thumbnail view)
        
        * Editable footer. Customize: portal_view_customizations -> plone.footer
