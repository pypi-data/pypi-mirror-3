Description: Introduction
        ============
        This package provides some nice integrations for PDF heavy web sites.
        
        * Generates thumbnails from PDF
        * Adds folder view for pdfs so it can use the generated thumbnail
        * Adds OCR for PDF indexing
        * Everything configurable so you can choose to not use thumbnail gen or OCR
        * Ability to create searchable PDFs with HOCR
        * use the `@@async-monitor` url to monitor asynchronous jobs that have yet to run
        
        
        OCR
        ---
        
        OCR requires Ghostscript to be installed and Tesseract. Just you package management
        to install these packages:
        
          # sudo apt-get install ghostscript tesseract-ocr
        
        This will install tessact 2 not tesseract 3.
        
        Searchable PDFs
        ---------------
        
        Requires svn checkout of tesseract version 3.01 or 3.00 with the hocr configuration in place.
        Take a look at this thread to find out how to configure hocr http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1647350
        
        In addition, you'll need exactimage and pdftk installed
        
          # sudo apt-get install exactimage pdftk libtiff-tools
        
        To not use the latest tesseract version to will have to add this in your
        instances declaration:
        
          environment-vars += AUTHORIZE_OLD_TESSERACT_VERSION true
        
        
        Plone 3
        -------
        
        * Requires hashlib
        
        
        Extra
        -----
        
        You can convert all at once by calling the url `@@queue-up-all`.
