Description: HTTP Dumper
        ===========
        
        This is a super quick-and-dirty WSGI application that prints out a few
        pieces of HTTP info (headers, GET/POST details). I've just implemented the
        bare minimum needed for a work project, so this is woefully incomplete. Feel
        free to fork and hack on it to fit your needs.
