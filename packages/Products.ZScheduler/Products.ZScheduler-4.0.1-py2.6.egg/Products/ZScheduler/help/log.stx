ZScheduler - Log

    Description

      *All* ZScheduleEvent's log when they are executed, and if they return any
      output, this is also logged.

      If you don't want ZScheduleEvent's to log, then you should call their
      underlying callable from your timer instead.

    Controls

      'Clear Log'  -- remove all log entries

      'Delete'  --  selectively delete log entries.
