Example Project
=======

The Example Project will get you started with a working version of servee.
It includes a sample image plugin, and django-flatpage support.  Both of these
are simple implementations to help you understand how you could make your own
ModelInsert plugins or how to convert your own models to be FrontendAdmin editable.

Running it.
===========

This is a bare django project + flatpages + required settings and installed apps for servee.

To build it, these instructions assume you have virtualenv + virtualenv wrapper installed.

Creating the Project::

    mkvirtualenv servee
    cd ~/Path/to/servee/
    python manage.py develop

    cd example_project/
    python manage.py syncdb
    python manage.py runserver
