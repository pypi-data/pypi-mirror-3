        =================
        
        Basic ZODB-based content type skeleton for Pyramid.
        
        Essentially, we noticed that most projects we did ended up having the same
        skeleton. This is to make them more reusable. While testing coverage is 100%,
        we seriously lack documentation and more field-testing, hence this is released
        as alpha.

        - If title and descriptions are specified for the schema factory, also transfer
          them to the schema itself. (Colander Schemas are transfered to Schema nodes on
          construction, which enables title and description) [sassur]

        - Exception raised when custom accessors or mutators created a loop. [robinharms]
        - Exposing field_storage as a public attribute should remove the need to
          the switch to override custom accessors / mutators. So it has been removed.
          Hopefully this will make it easier to use. [robinharms]
