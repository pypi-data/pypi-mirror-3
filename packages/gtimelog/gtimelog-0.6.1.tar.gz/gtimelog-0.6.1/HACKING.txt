Contributing to GTimeLog
========================

Contributions are welcome, and not just code patches.  I'd love to see

* user interface design sketches
* icons
* documentation
* translations (this would need some coding to enable translation first)
* installers for Mac OS X and Windows


Reporting bugs and wishes
-------------------------

Please `use Launchpad <https://bugs.launchpad.net/gtimelog/>`_ to
report bugs or feature requests.

If you don't want to create a Launchpad account for some reason, feel free to
send me an email at <marius@gedmin.as>.


Creating a patch
----------------

Here's how you can create and send me a a patch.  You'll need the `Bazaar
<http://bazaar.canonical.com/en/>`_ version control system installed on your
computer, as well as the usual stuff needed to run GTimeLog (`Python
<http://python.org/>`_, and `PyGtk <http://pygtk.org/>`_ or the GTK and Pango
gobject-introspection typelibs).

First, get a copy of the source code::

    bzr branch lp:gtimelog

You can run it without installing::

    cd gtimelog
    ./gtimelog

Change the code in ``src/gtimelog/*.py``, play around, run the test suite ::

    ./runtests

When you're happy with the results, describe your change in ``NEWS.txt`` and
commit ::

    bzr commit

`Publish your branch <https://help.launchpad.net/Code/UploadingABranch>`_ on Launchpad with ::

    bzr push lp:~userid/gtimelog/branch-name

and create a merge request through the Launchpad web interface
(``https://code.launchpad.net/~userid/gtimelog/branch-name/+register-merge``),
or with ::

    bzr lp-submit
