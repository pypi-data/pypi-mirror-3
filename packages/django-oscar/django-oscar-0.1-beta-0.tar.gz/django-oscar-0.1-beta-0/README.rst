Django-Oscar - Flexible e-commerce on Django 1.3
================================================

*django-oscar* is an e-commerce framework for Django 1.3 designed for building domain-driven
e-commerce sites.  It is structured such that any part of the core
functionality can be customised to suit the needs of your project.  This allows it to handle
a wide range of e-commerce sites, from large-scale B2C sites to complex B2B sites rich in
domain-specific business logic.

*django-oscar* was created by David Winterbottom (`@codeinthehole`_) and is developed and maintained by 
Tangent Labs, a London-based digital agency.
