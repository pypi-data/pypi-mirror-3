        In the buildout.cfg file of your buildout: 
        
        * Add ``quintagroup.theme.lite`` to the list of eggs to install::
        
            [buildout]
            ...
            eggs =
                ...

        * Re-run buildout, e.g. with::
        
            $ ./bin/buildout
            
        * Restart the Zope server, e.g with the following command in the terminal::
        
           $ ./bin/instance restart
        
        * On your Plone site go to Site Setup -> Add-ons and activate ``Lite Theme``.
        
        
        Installation: development mode
        ==============================
        
        If you want to customize Lite theme please use the following installation instructions: 
        
        * download ``quintagroup.theme.lite-version.zip`` archive from http://pypi.python.org/pypi/quintagroup.theme.lite
        * extract theme archive to get ``quintagroup.theme.lite-version`` folder. Remove version from 
          folder name to have ``quintagroup.theme.lite`` folder
        * put ``quintagroup.theme.lite`` folder into ``src`` directory of your buildout
        * in buildout.cfg file of your buildout add ``quintagroup.theme.lite`` to the list of eggs you are developing and to the list of eggs to install::
        
               [buildout]
               ...
               develop = src/quintagroup.theme.lite
               ...
               eggs =
                   ...
                   quintagroup.theme.lite
           
        * Re-run buildout::
        
            $ ./bin/buildout
        
        * Start instance in development mode::
        
            $ ./bin/instance fg
        
        * Install ``Lite Theme`` in Plone (Site Setup -> Add-ons).
        
        Now you can customize Lite Theme by modifying ``quintagroup.theme.lite`` package in ``src`` directory 
        of your buildout.
