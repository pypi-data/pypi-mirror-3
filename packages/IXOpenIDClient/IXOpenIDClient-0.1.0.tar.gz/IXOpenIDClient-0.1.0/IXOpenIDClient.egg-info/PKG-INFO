Description: ==============
        IXOpenIDClient
        ==============
        
        Library package for Django applications using the IX Profiles OpenID server
        for authentication.
        
        This package extends and requires django-openid-auth library.
        https://launchpad.net/django-openid-auth
        
        
        Settings
        --------
        
        This library supports all settings available in the django-openid-auth
        library but introduces a new one that must be set to activate this library:
        
        OPENID_SSO_IXPROFILES = True
        
        In addition, the following settings should be used:
        
        * OPENID_CREATE_USERS = False
        * OPENID_UPDATE_DETAILS_FROM_SREG = True
        * OPENID_USE_AS_ADMIN_LOGIN = True
        
        These settings will in order:
        * Prevent users of one ix openid based application from getting automatic
        to your application
        * Allow the OpenID server to update user profile information
        * Require OpenID login for the django admin area, providing consistent access
        
        You will also need to set the following to the correct urls for the
        particular iX profiles server instance your application will be using:
        
        * OPENID_SSO_SERVER_URL = '<url for server xrds>'
        * OPENID_SSO_SERVER_PROFILE_ROOT = '<root url for user profiles'>
        
        
        Functionality Provided
        ----------------------
        
        User Management
        ===============
        
        Simplifies user management by hooking into django user admin:
        * Removes the password field. All passwords are set to unusable
        * Automatically generates UserOpenId object for the user based on
        the OPENID_SSO_SERVER_PROFILE_ROOT setting.
        
        
        Dependencies
        ------------
        
        * Django: Might work on older versions but was developed for 1.3.0.
        * django-openid-auth which supplies the real functionality. This one
        has to be => 0.4 as some of the settings used are not available before
        that version.
        * pep8 and pylint: Not required for functionality but we like QC before
        committing any code changes so these tools need to be available. Note that
        if you'd like to contribute, any code you write must give a clean output with
        pep8 and score 10/10 with pylint using the configuration file
        conf/pylint.conf in the package
