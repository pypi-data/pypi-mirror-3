This module prints `function trace` to stdout from the moment it is called::

    import xtrace
    xtrace.start()
    ...
    xtrace.stop()

The output format is that of Xdebug http://xdebug.org/docs/execution_trace
But frankly, I didn't have time to polish it to be exactly the same. If you
will find the time and desire to polish it - feel free to send a patch.

This code is released into public domain. Hope you'll find it useful.
