Django-Email-Bandit
==============================

A Django email backend for hijacking email sending in test environment. It extends
the default SMTP backend to intercept outgoing emails and instead send them
to a single email address.

It does not intercept emails going to the site admins (as defined by the ADMINS
setting) so it will not impact the 500 error emails.


Requirements
-------------------------------

- Django >= 1.2


Installation
-------------------------------

To install django-email-bandit via pip::

    pip install django-email-bandit

Or you can from the latest version from Github manually::

    git clone git://github.com/caktus/django-email-bandit.git
    cd django-email-bandit
    python setup.py install

or via pip::

    pip install -e git+https://github.com/caktus/django-email-bandit.git

Add django-email-bandit to your installed apps::

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ...
        'bandit',
        ...
    )

For your test environment you should enable the backend::

    EMAIL_BACKEND = 'bandit.backends.smtp.HijackSMTPBackend'

and set the email which will receive all of the emails::

    BANDIT_EMAIL = 'bandit@example.com'


Using django-seacucumber
-------------------------------

django-email-bandit supports sending email through SES via 
`django-seacucumber <https://github.com/duointeractive/sea-cucumber>`_.

To configure django-email-bandit, set your email backend as follows::

    EMAIL_BACKEND = 'bandit.backends.seacuke.HijackSESBackend'


Only logging emails
-------------------

In environments where your application may generate lots of emails all at once,
it may be desirable to hijack emails to non-admins and have them logged, but
not sent out.

django-email-bandit supports this with the ``bandit.backends.smtp.LogOnlySMTPBackend``
and the ``bandit.backends.seacuke.LogOnlySESBackend``. For example, to configure
django-email-bandit to only log emails to non-admins, but still send via SMTP
emails to admins, configure your email backend like so::

    EMAIL_BACKEND = 'bandit.backends.smtp.LogOnlySMTPBackend'


Hijacking Arbitrary Backends
-------------------------------

You can also hijack email to an arbitrary Django email backend by wrapping a
backend of your choice with the HijackBackendMixin.  For example, if you wanted
to send email through SES but prefer to use 
`django-ses <https://github.com/hmarr/django-ses>`_, you would create a
class like this inside your project::

    from django_ses import SESBackend
    from bandit.backends.base import HijackBackendMixin


    class MyHijackBackend(HijackBackendMixin, SESBackend):
        """
        This backend intercepts outgoing messages drops them to a single email
        address, using the SESBackend in django-ses.
        """
        pass

and then set ``EMAIL_BACKEND`` as follows::

    EMAIL_BACKEND = 'my.project.path.to.MyHijackBackend'

Note that the order in which you specify the mixin and base class is very
important.  If you specify the mixin last, your email will not be hijacked.
