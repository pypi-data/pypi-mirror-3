Description: Overview
        ========
        
        Collections in Plone are the most powerful tool content editors and site
        managers have to construct navigation and site sections.
        
        This is a brand new implementation of collections for Plone, using
        ajax/javascript to make a simpler, easier and streamlined user experience
        for using collections. Having a more lightweight backend that does not depend
        on many nested criteria types.
        
        It's designed with simplicity and usability as a main focus, so content editors
        and site managers can create complex search queries with ease.
