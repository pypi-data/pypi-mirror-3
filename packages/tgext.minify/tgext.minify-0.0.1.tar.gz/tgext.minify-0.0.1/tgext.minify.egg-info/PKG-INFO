Description: About tgext.minify
        -------------------------
        
        tgext.minify is a Turbogears 2 middleware that minifies all css and javascript
        files in your public directory before serving them.
        Based on rCSSmin and rJSmin by Andr√© Malo.
        The middleware is based on `tgext.scss <https://bitbucket.org/_amol_/tgext.scss>`_ by Alessandro Molina
        
        Installing
        -------------------------------
        
        tgext.scss can be installed both from pypi or from bitbucket::
        
            easy_install tgext.minify
        
        should just work for most of the users
        
        Enabling tgext.minify
        ----------------------------------
        
        If tgext.pluggable is available enabling tgext.minify is just a matter of appending to your `config/app_cfg.py`::
        
            from tgext.pluggable import plug
            plug(base_config, 'tgext.minify')
        
        Otherwise manually using tgext.minify is really simple, you edit your `config/middeware.py` and just after
        the `#Wrap your base TurboGears 2 application with custom middleware here` comment wrap
        `app` with `MinifyMiddleware`::
        
            from tgext.minify import MinifyMiddleware
        
            make_base_app = base_config.setup_tg_wsgi_app(load_environment)
        
            def make_app(global_conf, full_stack=True, **app_conf):
                app = make_base_app(global_conf, full_stack=True, **app_conf)
        
                # Wrap your base TurboGears 2 application with custom middleware here
                app = MinifyMiddleware(app)
            
                return app
        
        
        Now you just have to put your beautiful .css and .js files inside *public/* and they will be served as minified.
        
        Performance boost
        -----------------------------------
        
        Here is the report of a benchmark made on paster serving bootstrap.css with and without the middleware
        and then bootstrap.min.js already minified (without using the middleware)::
        
            $ /usr/sbin/ab -n 1000 http://localhost:8080/css/bootstrap.css
            Requests per second:    1135.50 [#/sec] (mean)
        
            $ /usr/sbin/ab -n 1000 http://localhost:8080/css/bootstrap.css
            Requests per second:    714.99 [#/sec] (mean)
        
            $ /usr/sbin/ab -n 1000 http://localhost:8080/css/bootstrap.min.css
            Requests per second:    806.26 [#/sec] (mean)
        
        In these case serving the unminified css using tgext.minify is even faster
        than directly serving the same css file as it is served from memory
        (due to caching performed by tgext.minify).
