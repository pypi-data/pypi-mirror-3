Description: Repozitory is a library for archiving documents and recovering old
        versions. It is designed to work in tandem with a primary document
        storage mechanism such as ZODB. Repozitory stores the document versions
        in a PostgreSQL or SQLite database using SQLAlchemy. Repozitory was
        built for KARL, an open source online collaboration system, but
        Repozitory is intended to be useful for any Python project that stores
        user-editable documents.  Repozitory does not require ZODB.

        Changes
        =======
        
        1.3 (2012-09-01)
        ----------------
        
        - Added performance metrics using the perfmetrics package.
        
        1.2 (2012-01-30)
        ----------------
        
        - Added the ``shred`` method for deleting objects and containers permanently.
        
        1.1 (2012-01-24)
        ----------------
        
        - Added the ``iter_hierarchy`` method, which iterates over archived
          containers in a hierarchy more efficiently than repeated calls to
          ``container_contents``.
        
        - Added the ``which_contain_deleted`` method, which is useful
          for making a hierarchical trash UI with reasonable performance.
          Designed to help solve lp:913990.
        
        1.0 (2011-11-17)
        ----------------
        
        - Fixed lp:891277: Blob file chunks were sometimes retrieved in the
          wrong order due to an incorrect backref declaration.
        
        0.2.1 (2011-09-22)
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed packaging on PyPI (essential files were missing;
          setuptools-git was needed.)
        
        0.2 (2011-09-15)
        ----------------
        
        - Added the new_container_ids attribute to deleted item records.  This
          allows undeletion UIs to filter out objects that have moved to another
          container.  It should also allow applications to redirect users to the new
          location of a moved object.  No schema migration is needed.
        
        - Added the get_version method to archives.  The get_version method is more
          efficient than iterating over the entire history of an object.
        
        0.1 (2011-08-14)
        ----------------
        
        - Initial release.
