Description: ========================
        imread: Read Image Files
        ========================
        
        Simple module with a small number of functions:
        
        imread
            Reads an image file
        imread_multi
            Reads an image file with multiple images. Currently, TIFF and STK (a TIFF
            sub-based format) support this function.
        imsave
            Writes an image file
        
        This grew out of frustration at current image loading solutions in Python, in
        either my packages [mahotas] or packages from others [scikits.image, for
        example].
        
        The relationship with numpy is very contained and this could be easily
        repurposed to load images in other frameworks, even other programming
        languages.
