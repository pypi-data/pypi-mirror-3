Description: A buildout extension to allow any section of 'parts' to define options
        which will be appended to an option of another section.
        
        Example configuration
        ---------------------
        
        [buildout]
        extensions = erp5.extension.sectionextender
        
        section-extender =
          supervisor-instance:programs supervisor-program
        
        parts =
          supervisor-instance
          test1-instance
          test3-instance
        
        [supervisor-instance]
        recipe = collective.recipe.supervisor
        
        [test1-instance]
        recipe = recipe.foo.bar
        supervisor-program = 21 test1-instance test1-instance
        
        [test2-instance]
        recipe = recipe.foo.bar2
        supervisor-program = 22 test2-instance test2-instance
        
        [test3-instance]
        recipe = recipe.foo.bar3
        supervisor-program = 23 test3-instance test3-instance
        
        
        With this configuration, 'supervisor-program' options in
        'test1-instance' and 'test3-instance' will be added to
        '${supervisor-instance:programs}', but not 'test2-instance' as it's
        not in 'parts'.
        
        You can specify several sections to be extended by just adding them to
        'section-extender' (one per line).
