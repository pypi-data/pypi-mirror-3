Description: browser.Browser
        
            A minimal browser based on pycurl/lxml.
        
            Mechanize seemed a bit slow for my usage, so I wrote this alternative using
            pycurl (i.e. libcurl) and lxml, mostly focused on speed, whilst not
            compromising on the features I see as useful (cookies and form selection/
            POSTing).
        
            Plans:
                form support for radio, checkbox types
                decorator to catch errors and rethrow with attached browser data for
                    easier scraper debugging
        
        rest_client.RestClient
        
            A simple REST client based upon pycurlbrowser.
        
            CRUD approach providing:
                create
                read
                update
                destroy
        
        rest_client.RestClientJson
        
            A REST client that only speaks JSON.
        
            Building upon RestClient to convert to/from JSON for a more streamlined
            experience taking in and returning Python primitives, using JSON as a
            transport protocol.
