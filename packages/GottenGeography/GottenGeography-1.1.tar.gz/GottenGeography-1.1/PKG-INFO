Description: GottenGeography is a GNOME application that aims to make it easy to record
        geotags into your photographs. If you have a GPS device, GottenGeography can
        load it's GPX data and directly compare timestamps between the GPX data and the
        photos, automatically determining where each photo was taken. If you do not have
        a GPS device, GottenGeography allows you to manually place photos onto a map,
        and then record those locations into the photos.
