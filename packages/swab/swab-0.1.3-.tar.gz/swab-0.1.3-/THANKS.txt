THANKS
------

I am especially indebted to the work of the following people:

	- Ben Tilly, for persuading me of the importance of good statistical
	  analysis: http://elem.com/~btilly/effective-ab-testing/

	- Patrick McKenzie, whose blog postings and links showed me that the
	  maths needn't be scary, and that the programming would be fun
	  
	- CÃ©ondo, for creating this calculator: http://abtester.com/calculator/

Plus the many other maths, programming and marketing geeks whose blogs and
articles have shown me the way on this.
