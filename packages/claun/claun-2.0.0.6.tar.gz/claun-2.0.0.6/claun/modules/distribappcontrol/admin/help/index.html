Frameworks & Controllers

Introduction
------------

Frameworks and controllers provide support for distributed applications runtime
in CAVE. Frameworks are libraries that enable distributed synchronized
application rendering. Controllers provide support for joypads and other
devices controlling user's movement.

Due to the diversity of frameworks and controllers, the configuration is passed
as a key-value list. Every framework/controller can have many named
configurations that are selectable for the application. Application itself
can override some framework/configuration settings. Framework settings can
be influenced by the environment parameters.

Frameworks
-----------
Support for every framework has two parts:
  - Configuration Builder - This piece of software takes the configuration
    set by the user (environment parameters, application configuration, platform
    information) and creates a configuration for the cluster setup used for this
    configuration. The configuration is passed to App Runners on all necessary
    nodes. Typical placement of this module is on the control server.
    (see claun.modules.distribappcontrol)
  - App Runner - This is responsible for running the application's framework
    on destination node. It should directly control the application process. It
    should probably not control any dependencies. (see claun.modules.apprunner)

Supported frameworks so far:
  - CAVELib

Controllers
-----------

Some framework are not capable of controlling the user's movement and need a
third-party library which we will call a controller. Every application can
declare its dependency on a controller software. During startup, it is then
necessary to create controller's configuration and start the software on
the appropriate node.

Support for every controller has two parts:
  - Configuration Builder - This piece of software takes the configuration
    declared by the application and creates a configuration for the selected
    application instance. The configuration is passed to Controller typically
    on a master node. Typical placement of this module is on the control server.
    (see claun.modules.distribappcontrol)
  - Controller - This is responsible for running the controller software
    on the destination node (typically master node). It should directly
    control the controller process. (see claun.modules.controller)

Supported frameworks so far:
  - trackd
