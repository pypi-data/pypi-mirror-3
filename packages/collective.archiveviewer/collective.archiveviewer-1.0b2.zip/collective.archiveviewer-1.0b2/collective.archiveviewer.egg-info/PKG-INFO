Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        Allow to view content of archive files into plone.
        
        How it works
        ============
        
        Add a File with zipped content, this will be marked with 'collective.archiveviewer.interfaces.IArchiveFile'.
        
        Now you can access the content trough web by appending '@@contents/$filename' to the path of your file.
        
        For instance, if you have a file 'foo.html' inside the archive you can view it by going to 
        'http://yourplone.com/yourzipfile/@@contents/foo.html'.
        
        Supported archives
        ==================
        
        - *.zip (application/zip)
        
        NOTE: archives are supported trough adapters. You can simply register a named adapter providing 'IArchiveReader' interface and
        name it as the meta type to be supported (like 'application/zip').
        
        Please, refer to 'interfaces.py' and 'adapters.py' for understanding how to write yours.
