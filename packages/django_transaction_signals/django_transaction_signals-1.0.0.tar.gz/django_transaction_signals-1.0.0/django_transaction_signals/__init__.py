    Exception raised when a post_commit or post_rollback handler updates the
    current transaction and doesn't perform its own commit/rollback. This is
    usually easily mitigated by using a wrapper like @commit_on_success.

    Also see the defer() function in this module for another approach that
    avoids this error.

def defer(f, *args, **kwargs):
    '''
    Wrapper that defers a function's execution until the current transaction
    commits, if a transaction is active.  Otherwise, executes as usual. Note
    that a deferred function will NOT be called if the transaction completes
    without committing (e.g. when transaction.is_dirty() is False upon exiting
    the transaction).

    An implicit assumption is that a deferred function does not return an
    important value, since there is no way to retrieve the return value in
    the normal execution order.

    Before being connected to the 'post_commit' signal of an existing managed
    transaction, the deferred function is wrapped by the @commit_on_success
    decorator to ensure that it behaves properly by committing or rolling back
    any updates it makes to a current transaction.
