        Introduction
        ============
        
        This library packages a patched version of json template for
        `fanstatic`_. This behaved exactly like the official version, except
        it add an option ``undefined_callable`` that is a function that will
        be called in case of an undefined value, to return the value to be
        use.
        
        .. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
        
        This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
        and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
        directory in ``zeam.jsontemplate``) are published to some URL.
        
        
        How to use?
        ===========
        
        
        You can import ``jsontemplate`` from ``zeam.jsontemplate`` and
        ``need`` it where you want these resources to be included on a page::
        
          >>> from zeam.jsontemplate import jsontemplate
          >>> jsontemplate.need()
