Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        Subscribe a set of users taking from a CSV file all required data.
        
        Detail
        ------
        
        With this product you can import in your Plone site a full set of users, providing a CSV
        file with all required and optional data. If your user's fieldset is customized you can also
        provide non-standards ones.
        
        The only required column is *username*. The *password* data, if not provided, will be
        generated randomly.
        
        If you have powers to manage groups, you can also add all new users to one or more groups
        available.
        
        Finally you can send a notification message to those users, customizing the message text
        (for example: to give to users the account's email address).
