Description: semidiscrete
        ============
        
        Python bindings for the semidiscrete RT model of Gobron et al.
        
        Note this version includes adjoint code developed by N Gobron, T Kaminski, 
        P Lewis and J Gomez-Dans derived from the original NADIM/semidiscrete. These
        modifications were funded by the ESA `EOLDAS <http://www.assimila.eu/eoldas>`_
        project.
        
        The original semidiscrete code can be found `here <http://fapar.jrc.ec.europa.eu/WWW/Data/Pages/FAPAR_Software/FAPAR_Software_RTModels_1-2Discrete.php>`_
