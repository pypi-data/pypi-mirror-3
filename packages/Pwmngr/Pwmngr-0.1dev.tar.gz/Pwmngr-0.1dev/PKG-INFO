Description: PwMngr 
        ======
        
        A CLI password manager. 
        
        pwmngr was designed with a few requirement : 
        * use a dead simple CLI interface
        * have a readable text file as backend, that could be checked in a vcs, or 
          carried around the cloud. 
        * be secure.

        ===================
        
        Disclaimer : this software was not written by a cryptography specialist, and needs to be checked-out by specialists. 
        
        However, this tool make use of proven algorithms : Passwords are encrypted using AES256, (courtesy of PyCrypto), with the encryption key being generated from your password, a random hash (different for each of your passwords) and the pbkdf2 key derivation algorithm. 
        
        The rationale is that you can encrypt all your password with the same master password, a different encryption key is generated for your passwords.

          -h, --help            show this help message and exit
          -f FILE, --file FILE  the password file (default ~/.pwmngr)
          -g, --generate        generate a random password instead of prompting you
                                for the password when setting passwords
          -v, --show            default pwmngr store the clear password to clipboard.
