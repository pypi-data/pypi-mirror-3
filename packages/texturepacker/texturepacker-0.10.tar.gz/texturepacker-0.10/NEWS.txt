0.8.1
=====

12 April 2011

  prevent this.

4 April 2011

- `Loader.add_local_knowledge` allows you to use a local copy of HTTP

  those resources)

0.6.3 (Head cold special)
========================

3 April 2011


- `Map.get_alt_list` allows `stone1` as well as `stone_1`, but knows
  that `crop0`, ..., `crop7` are not alternative versions of a
  nonexistent texture `crop`.

- Bug fix: using a string to fetch an atlas resulted in an infinite
  loop! Now the string is instead treated as a URL
