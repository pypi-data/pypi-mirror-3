Description: ======================
        Django Session Cleanup
        ======================
        
        A periodic task for removing expired Django sessions from the django_session table
        
        For projects that use the ``cached_db`` or ``db`` session engines, the ``django_session`` table can get quite large after a while.
        
        Django provides the 'cleanup' management command for deleting expired sessions from this table but you have to either run this command manually or set-up a cron job.
        
        Django Session Cleanup provides a periodic task for `Celery <http://celeryproject.org/>`_ that will delete expired sessions on a weekly basis.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        1. Run ``pip install django-session-cleanup`` or place ``session_cleanup`` on your Python path.
        
        2. Add ``session_cleanup`` to your list of ``INSTALLED_APPS``.
        
        3. Add an entry to, or create a ``CELERYBEAT_SCHEDULE`` in your project's settings::
        
            from session_cleanup.settings import weekly_schedule
            CELERYBEAT_SCHEDULE = {
                ...
                'session_cleanup': weekly_schedule
            }
