Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        Simple package which makes jQuery UI Chatbox available in portal_javascript and
        portal_css. This package does not change nor define any view or templates. It 
        basically does nothing from the user point of view. It is usable for template 
        developers to avoid several chatbox libraries registered from different 
        products
