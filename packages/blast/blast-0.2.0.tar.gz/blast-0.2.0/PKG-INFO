        overview
        --------
        
        blast is a simple web-based, multi-platform music/mp3 player written in python, HTML/CSS and javascript.
        
        
        installation
        ------------
        
        the easiest way to install blast is by using python setuptools "easy_install" command:
        
        ::
        
        $ easy_install blast
        
        you can also install using ez_setup, pip or installing the package directly using setup.py:
        
        ::
        
        $ python setup.py install
        
        
        usage
        -----
        
        ::
        
        $ cd ~/Music
        $ blast
        
        then you can connect to the blast frontend at http://localhost:5000 (or via IP if you're binding externally with -x).
        
        NOTE: if you use flashblock, make sure to whitelist your blast server (otherwise the URLs will simply open as if you clicked them)
        
        
        blast is primarily keystroke driven. here's a list of the available key commands:
        
        ::
        
        v         Play
        c         Toggle Pause
        x         Stop
        j k       Next / Previous Track (Google Reader style)
        n         Next Track (same as j, Google Reader style)
        b z       Next / Previous Track (Winamp Style)
        , .       Reverse or Skip Ahead 1 second
        { }       Reverse or Skip Ahead 5 seconds
        [ ]       Reverse or Skip Ahead 30 seconds
        0         Reset to 0 position
        s         Toggle Shuffle
        m         Toggle Mute
        ?         Toggle Help
        r         Randomize List
        d         Debug Mode
        
        when in doubt, you can also hit the "?" key in the UI to see this same help information.
        
        in addition to key commands, you can click on tracks to play/pause and seek around in tracks by clicking on the duration bar.
