Description: ``jslibs``
        ==============
        
        ``jslibs`` is a small package with few dependencies, aimed at providing
        a high quality, curated set of Javascript packages for Pyramid
        projects. In essence, a group of people have taken the work they are
        already doing, then pushing it out to share with others. This work
        includes use of `Juicer <https://github.com/cjohansen/juicer>`_ to
        increase responsiveness of apps.
        
        
        See `http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/jslibs/dev/
        <http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/jslibs/dev/>`_
        or ``docs/index.rst`` in this distribution for detailed
        documentation.
        
        
        Next release
        ============
        
         - ...
           [...]
        
        
        0.9 (2012-02-21)
        ----------------
        
        - Replace badly packaged 0.8
          [ree]
        
        0.8 (2012-02-21)
        ----------------
        
        - Add a second plugin mix for tinymce 3.4.8, without the broken
          autosave plugin. (If this plugin loads together with the fixed
          plugin, it will not let the user leave some pages, even if,
          the plugin itself won't get deployed.)
          [ree]
        
        
        0.7 (2012-02-16)
        ----------------
        
        - Add popup resource mix for tinymce 3.4.8
          [ree]
        
          
        0.6 (2012-02-15)
        ----------------

        0.5 (2012-01-13)
        ----------------
        
        - 0.5 is same as 0.4 (make sure that no 0.4 egg stays, because a broken 0.4 egg
          has been uploaded to pypi)
          [ree]
        
        
        0.4 (2012-01-13)

        ----------------
