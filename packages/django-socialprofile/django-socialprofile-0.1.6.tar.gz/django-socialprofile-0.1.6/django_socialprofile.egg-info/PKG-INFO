        Django Social Profile
        =====================
        
        Django Social Profile gives you an out-of-the-box way to let users create an account in your application using
        Google, Twitter, or Facebook authentication.
        
        Users can edit their profile, view other users' profiles, and add multiple types of auth to the same profile.
        
        Django Social Profile relies on omab's excellent  `django-socialauth <https://github.com/omab/django-social-auth>`_ to do
        the actual authentication with the backend providers. If you are just looking for the authentication piece, as opposed
        to the UI for customers to use, that module will be all you need. If you are willing to spend a bit of time with the UI,
        you can integrate any of the backends that django-socialauth provides (which is extensive).

        Features
        ========
        
        This module is meant to be as quick to integrate as possible, and thus extensive customization will likely benefit from
        a fork. That said, a number of options are available.
        
        The idea is to let you have a working system for letting users create profiles with social auth, edit them, delete them,
        and merge them, out of the box.
        
        All the underlying bits to make this work come with django-socialauth, this project just pulls them together with a UI.
        
        
        Dependencies
        ============
        
        Dependencies that **must** be meet to use the application:
        
        - `django-social-auth: <https://github.com/omab/django-social-auth>`_
        
        - `python-openid <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-openid/>`_
        
        - `oauth2 <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/oauth2>`_
        
        - You will need API Keys from Google, Facebook, and Twitter.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        From `pypi <https://pypi.python.org>`_::
        
            $ pip install django-socialprofile
        
        or::
        
            $ easy_install django-socialprofile
        
        or clone from `github <http://github.com>`_::
        
            $ git clone git://github.com/cyface/django-socialprofile.git
        
        and add django-socialprofile to the ``PYTHONPATH``::
        
            $ export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$(pwd)/django-socialprofile/
        
        or::
        
            $ cd django-socialprofile
            $ sudo python setup.py install
        
        
        Demo App
        ========
        The socialprofile_demo app is included to quickly let you see how to get a working installation going.
        
        The demo is built as a mobile app using `jQueryMobile <http://jquerymobile.com/>`_ loaded from the jQuery CDN.
        
        Take a look at the ``requirements.txt`` file in the ``socialprofile_demo`` directory for a quick way to use pip to install
        all the needed dependencies::
        
            $ pip install -r requirements.txt
        
        The ``settings_main.py``, and ``settings_local_template.py`` files have a working configuration you can crib from.
        
        The templates in the ``socialprofile/templates`` and ``socialprofile_demo/templates`` directories
        give you a good idea of the kinds of things you will need to do if you want to provide a custom interface.
        
        Configuration
        =============
        
        Configuration is minimal for socialprofile itself, more config is needed for ``django-socialauth``. A quick guide to a basic setup
        is below, take a look at the demo app for more details.
        
        Add INSTALLED_APPS
        ------------------
        
        Add social_auth and socialprofile to installed applications::
        
            INSTALLED_APPS = (
                ...
                'social_auth',
                'socialprofile',
            )
        
        Add urls to urls.py
        --------------------
        
        In your urls.py, you need to pull in the socialprofile urls::
        
            # Social Profiles
            url(r'^socialprofile/', include('socialprofile.urls')),
        
        The ``django-socialauth`` urls get pulled in by socialprofile as ``/socialprofile/socialauth/``.
        
        Configure django-socialauth
        ---------------------------
        
        All of the configuration for ``django-socialauth`` applies to this module, although the supplied templates only cover
        Google, Facebook, and Twitter.
        
        - Setup your backends::
        
            # Django Socialauth Settings
            AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = (
        	    'django.contrib.auth.backends.ModelBackend',
        	    'social_auth.backends.twitter.TwitterBackend',
        	    'social_auth.backends.facebook.FacebookBackend',
        	    'social_auth.backends.google.GoogleOAuth2Backend',
        	)
        
        - Set up what page to go to post-authentication::
        
            # Social Authentication (django-socialauth) Settings
            SOCIAL_AUTH_LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL = '/secure/'
            SOCIAL_AUTH_NEW_USER_REDIRECT_URL = '/secure/'
            SOCIAL_AUTH_NEW_ASSOCIATION_REDIRECT_URL = '/secure/'
        
        - Set up the redirects for forcing auth on the way to other pages::
        
            # Core Authentication Settings
            LOGIN_URL          = '/socialprofile/select/'
            LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL = '/secure/'
            LOGIN_ERROR_URL    = '/socialprofile/select/'
        
        Register for your API Keys
        --------------------------
        
        Google
        ^^^^^^
        
        https://code.google.com/apis/console/
        
        Set the return URL to http://localhost:8000/socialprofile/socialauth/complete/google-oauth2/ for development when you
        set up the API key.
        
        Twitter
        ^^^^^^^
        
        https://dev.twitter.com/apps/new
        
        Set the callback URL to http://localhost:8000/socialprofile/socialauth/complete/twitter/ for development when
        you set up the API key.
        
        Facebook
        ^^^^^^^^
        
        Facebook is a bit of a pain, since you can only have one URL per API key.
        
        https://developers.facebook.com/apps
        
        Set the site URL http://localhost:8000/ for local development.
        
        Facebook also allows you to request additional information beyond authentication. The default setup
        assumes you are requesting the user's email address. See below for how to note that in the API settings.
        
        See https://developers.facebook.com/docs/authentication/permissions/#extended_perms for details
        on other permissions you can request.
        
        Add API Keys to Settings
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        Take the keys from your APIs and add them to your settings::
        
            TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY         = ''
            TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET      = ''
            FACEBOOK_APP_ID              = ''
            FACEBOOK_API_SECRET          = ''
            FACEBOOK_EXTENDED_PERMISSIONS = ['email',]
            GOOGLE_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID      = ''
            GOOGLE_OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET  = ''
            GOOGLE_OAUTH_EXTRA_SCOPE     = ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.profile',]
        
        Note that the extended permissions and such there are typical, you may also want to request the ability to post as that user
        and so forth.
        
        Views and Layers
        ================
        
        Login Modal Layer
        --------------------
        
        The 'socialprofile/select' view provides a login modal that you can use to both force existing users to sign in
        as well as to enable new users to select how they want to authenticate to the site.
        
        If you have LOGIN_URL set to ``/socialprofile/select/``, this will work automatically.
        
        The default template has attributes to make this a nice modal using jQueryMobile, but the HTML is straightforward,
        and a custom template should be simple to create.
        
        Self Profile View
        --------------------
        
        The ``socialprofile/`` view lets a user see their own profile. The default template checks to see if they profile is
        indeed theirs, and displays an 'edit' button taking them to the ``socialprofile/edit/`` view.
        
        This view supports a ``?returnTo=`` parameter to specify a URL path to return to once the user is done. The default template
        uses this for the ``< Return`` button.
        
        Other Profile View
        ---------------------
        
        The ``socialprofile/view/<username>`` view lets a user see any profile. You may want to adjust the template to hide any
        profile fields that should not be public.
        
        This view supports a ``?returnTo=`` parameter to specify a URL path to return to once the user is done. The default template
        uses this for the ``< Return`` button.
        
        Profile Edit View
        --------------------
        
        The ``socialprofile/edit/`` view lets a user edit their own profile. In typical Django fashion, a GET request to this view
        will display the form, while a POST request to this view will try and save the changes.
        
        This view supports a ``?returnTo=`` parameter to specify a URL path to return to once the user is done. The default template
        uses this for the ``Cancel`` and ``Done`` button. When the form returns to the Self Profile View, it passes ``returnTo``.
        
        Profile Add Auth Type
        ------------------------
        
        A user can add an additional social authentication type to their existing profile. If they originally created their
        profile using Google auth, then they could add Facebook and Twitter, enabling them to sign in with any of those services
        and access the same account.
        
        To do this, just have the customer log in with their new auth type, and django-socialauth will do the rest.
        
        Profile Delete Auth Type
        ----------------------------
        
        This is a default feature of django-socialauth, and is available using::
        
            {% url socialauth_disconnect user_social_auth.provider %}
        
        ... in a template.
        
        Delete Account
        ------------------
        
        It is important to let customers remove their accounts, and the /socialprofile/delete view prompts them to ensure they
        really want to delete their account before sending them to /socialprofile/delete/action?confirm=true.
        
        You may want to provide your own function to do this, that perhaps only deactivates their account.
