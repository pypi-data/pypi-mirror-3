Hammock!
========

Hammock is a fun module lets you deal with rest APIs by converting them into dead simple programmatic APIs.
It uses popular `requests` module in backyard to provide full-fledged rest experience.

Proof
-----

Let's play with github::

    >>> from hammock import Hammock as Github

    >>> # This generates a url such as below and requests it via http GET
    >>> resp = Github('https://api.github.com').repos('kadirpekel', 'hammock').watchers.GET()

    >>> print(resp.url)
    https://api.github.com/repos/kadirpekel/hammock/watchers

    >>> # now you're ready to take a rest for the rest the of code :)
    >>> for watcher in resp.json: print watcher.get('login')
    kadirpekel
    ...
    ..
    .

Not convinced? This is how you watch this project to see its future capabilities::

    >>> from hammock import Hammock as Github

    >>> resp = Github('https://api.github.com').user.watched('kadirpekel').PUT('hammock',
                                    auth=('<user>', '<pass>'), headers={'content-length': '0'})

    >>> print(resp)
    <Response [204]>

Install
-------

The best way to install Hammock is using pypi repositories via `easy_install` or `pip`::

    $ pip install hammock

Documentation
-------------

Hammock is a magical, polymorphic(!), fun and simple class which helps you generate RESTful urls
and lets you request them using `requests` module in an easy and slick way.

Below the all phrases make request to the same url of 'http://localhost:8000/users/foo/posts/bar/comments'.
Note that all of them are valid but some of them are nonsense in their belonging context::

    >>> import hammock
    >>> api = hammock.Hammock('http://localhost:8000')
    >>> api.users('foo').posts('bar').comments.GET()
    <Response [200]>
    >>> api.users.foo.posts('bar').GET('comments')
    <Response [200]>
    >>> api.users.foo.posts.bar.comments.GET()
    <Response [200]>
    >>> api.users('foo', 'posts', 'comments').GET()
    <Response [200]>
    >>> api('users')('foo', 'posts').GET('bar', 'comments')
    <Response [200]>
    >>> # Any other combinations ...

Hammock class instance provides `requests` module's all http methods binded on itself as uppercased version
while dropping the first arg 'url' in replacement of `*args` to let you to continue appending url components.

Also you can continue providing any keyword argument for corresponding http verb method of `requests` module::

    Hammock.[GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE](*args, **kwargs)

Return type is the same `Response` object `requests` module provides.

Here is some more real world applicable example which uses twitter api::

    >>> import hammock
    >>> twitter = hammock.Hammock('https://api.twitter.com/1')
    >>> tweets = twitter.statuses('user_timeline.json').GET(params={'screen_name':'kadirpekel', 'count':'10'}).json
    >>> for tweet in tweets: print tweet.get('text')
    my tweets
    ...
    ..
    .

You might also want to use sessions. Let's take a look at the JIRA example below which maintains basic
auth credentials through several http requests::

    >>> import hammock

    >>> # You can configure a session by providing keyword args to `Hammock` constructor to initiate builtin `requests` session
    >>> # This sample below shows the use of auth credentials through several requests by intitiating a embedded session
    >>> jira = hammock.Hammock('https://jira.atlassian.com/rest/api/latest', auth=('<user>', '<pass>'))

    >>> my_issue = 'JRA-9'

    >>> # Let's get a jira issue. No auth credentials provided explicitly since parent
    >>> # hammock already has a `requests` session configured.
    >>> issue = jira.issue(my_issue).GET()

    >>> # Now watch the issue again using with the same session
    >>> watched = jira.issue(my_issue).watchers.POST(params={'name': '<user>'})

    >>> print(watched)

More detailed, concrete documentation coming soon...
