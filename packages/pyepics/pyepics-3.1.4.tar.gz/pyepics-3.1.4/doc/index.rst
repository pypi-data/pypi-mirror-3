Epics Channel Access for Python
=====================================

The Epics Python package is an interface for the Channel Access (CA)
library of the `Epics control system <http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/>`_
to the Python Programming language.

The epics package provides methods for reading from and writing to
Epics Process Variables via the CA protocol.  The package includes a
complete, thin layer over the low-level Channel Access library in the
:mod:`ca` module, and a few higher-level abstractions built on top of
this basic functionality.  The :mod:`PV` class provides a `PV` object
for an object-oriented approach, and there is also a simple functional
approach to CA similar to EZCA and the Unix command-line tools `caget`,
`caput`, `cainfo`, and `camonitor`.  In addition, there are classes for
an epics :mod:`Device`, epics :mod:`Motor`, :mod:`Alarm`, and special
code for wxPython widgets.
