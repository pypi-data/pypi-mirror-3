        What Is This?
        =============
        
        It's a spam filter.  I wrote this to filter spammy comments from a high
        traffic forum website and it worked pretty well.  It can work for you too :)
        It's not tied to any particular format like email, it just deals with the raw
        text.
        
        This is probably the only spam filtering library you'll find for Python that's
        simple (170 lines of code), works (30 lines of test code), and doesn't suck.
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        From folder::
        
            sudo python setup.py install
        
        From cheeseshop::
        
            sudo pip install redisbayes
        
        From git::
        
            sudo pip install git+git://github.com/jart/redisbayes.git
        
        
        Basic Usage
        ===========
        
        ::
        
            import redis, redisbayes
            rb = redisbayes.RedisBayes(redis=redis.Redis())
        
            rb.train('good', 'sunshine drugs love sex lobster sloth')
            rb.train('bad', 'fear death horror government zombie god')
        
            assert rb.classify('sloths are so cute i love them') == 'good'
            assert rb.classify('i fear god and love the government') == 'bad'
        
            print rb.score('i fear god and love the government')
        
            rb.untrain('good', 'sunshine drugs love sex lobster sloth')
            rb.untrain('bad', 'fear death horror government zombie god')
