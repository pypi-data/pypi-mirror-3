Description: Overview
        ========
        
        ECAutoAssessmentBox is a Plone product derived from ECAssignmentBox 
        and provides special support for automatic evaluation of student 
        submissions, e.g., programming assignments.
          
        Basically ECAutoAssessmentBox works like ECAssignmentBox.  Automatic 
        assessment of programs is handled by ECSpooler (available separately) 
        which manages a submission queue and several backends.  When a student 
        submits a program, it is routed to the backend specified by the 
        teacher for this assignment.  The results of the tests performed by 
        the backend are immediately returned and displayed.

        Prerequisites
        =============
        
        #. To use ECAutoAssessmentBox you need a current Plone installation, 
           specifically Plone 4.x.  Check `plone.org`_ for Plone's
           prerequisites.
        
        #. The `ECAssignmentBox`_ product.

        Installation
        ============
        
        See the `Installing an Add-on Product`_ tutorial for more detailed 
        product installation instructions.

        Installing with buildout
        ------------------------
        
        If you are using `buildout`_ to manage your instance installing 
        ECAutoAssessmentBox is very simple.  You can install it by adding it 
        to the eggs line for your instance::
        
          [instance]
          eggs =
              ... 
              Products.ECAutoAssessmentBox
        
        After updating the configuration you need to run ``bin/buildout``, 
        which will take care of updating your system.
        
        Then restart your zope instance and use the Add/Remove products page
        in Site Setup to install ECAutoAssessmentBox.
        
        .. _buildout: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zc.buildout
        
        
        Installing without buildout
        ---------------------------
        
        Move (or symlink) the ``ECAutoAssessmentBox`` folder of this project
        (``Products.ECAutoAssessmentBox/Products/ECAutoAssessmentBox``) into 
        the ``Products`` directory of the Zope instance it has to be installed 
        for, and restart the server.  Use the Add/Remove products page in 
        Site Setup to install ECAutoAssessmentBox.

        History
        =======
        
        # Changes in release 1.4.2 (2011-10-07)
        
        - The new field ``Instant Feedback`` for AutoAssessmentBoxes allows teachers
          to decide whether or not the automatic feedback from ECSpooler/backends will
          be shown to students.
        
        - A lot of minor bugfixes regarding the new release of ECSpooler (1.2). 
        
        
        # Changes in release 1.4.1 (2011-08-14)
        
        - Fixed issue: ImportError: No module named schema.vocabulary
        
        
        # Changes in release 1.4 (2011-08-10)
        
        - Added compatibility for Plone 4. Plone 3.x support has been dropped.
          Plone 3 users should use ECAutoAssessmentBox 1.1.
        
        - KSS is used to display input fields for a selected backend without 
          loading the whole edit page again.
        
        
        # Changes in release 1.1 (2009-10-09)
        
        - ECAutoAssessmentBox was completly re-implemented with support for 
          Plone 3.
        
        - ECAutoAssessmentBox is now eggified and uploaded to PyPI.  An old-style 
          tarball distribution is still available at plone.org.
        
        
        # Changes in release 1.0 (2007-04-16)
        
        - Added check box "Automatically accept assignments" to 
          ECAutoAssessmentBox to automatically move an assignment in state 
          "accepted" if it successfully passed all tests.  (Makes sense for
          backens which return true or false only.)
        
        - Settings for ECSpooler and appropriated backends are now stored as 
          portal properties.  Therefore it is no longer necessary to set up
          spooler and backends after re-install.
        
        - Indicators are now differ depending on the backends result type, 
          i.e., for backends returning True or False an icon will be displayed,
          otherwise the plain result value (e.g., percentage or score.)
        
        - Performance improvements: We are now using portal_catalog where
          possible.
