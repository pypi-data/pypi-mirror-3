        =======
        
        About
        ----------
        This small library provides you with a simple interface to open files in
        an active geany instance. This can be used in simple scripts for example.
        
        
        Requirements
        -----------------
        This library depends on PyGObject. Unfortunately I can't specify this in the
        ``setup.py`` file because as of version 2.28.3 PyGObject doesn't support the
        installation process with pip. This is an issue but I can't help it.
        
        
        Example
        ------------
        Opening a file:
        
            >>> import PyGeany
            >>> with PyGeany.GeanyConnection() as a:
            ...     a.send_open('/tmp/test')
            ...
