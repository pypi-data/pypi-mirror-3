Description: ObjP's goal is to create a two-way bridge between Python and Objective-C. Unlike PyObjC, which uses
        dynamic calls to methods on runtime, ObjP generates static code. It generates either Objective-C
        interfaces to Python code or Python modules to interface Objective-C code.
        
        At the moment, the library is exceedingly rudimentary, but it works for simple cases. One of these
        cases is in demos/simple. To build and run this demo do (Python 3.2+ required)::
        
            $ ./waf configure build
            $ cd build
            $ ./HelloWorld
        
        That programs calls a simple Python script from Objective-C, and that python script itself calls
        an Objective-C class.
