Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        ckeditor, a wysiwyg editor for Plone 4 and more.
        
        Dependencies
        ============
        
        Plone4 and more.
        
        collective.plonefinder is used for attached media browsing and upload.
        
        when using buildout or easy_install, collective.plonefinder is installed.
        
        Install collective.ckeditor in your zope instance
        =================================================
        
        two options :
        
        - add "collective.ckeditor" in your eggs and zcml sections of your plone 4 buildout
          then run "bin/buildout" or "bin\buildout" under win32
          look at ckeditor.cfg if you are using plone 4 core dev buildout
        
        - >>> easy_install collective.ckeditor
        
        Read docs/INSTALL.txt for more information
        
        Install ckeditor in Plone
        =========================
        
        Use the Plone "Add Products" Control Panel.
        Choose "CKeditor for Plone 3.x"
        Click on Activate
        It will also install collective.plonefinder
        
        
        Plone 3 :
        ---------
        
        No support is provided for Plone3.
        
        If you really need ckeditor for Plone3 contact us support@ingeniweb.com
        
        You can always use FCKeditor for Plone.
        
        
        Development
        ===========
        
        After checking out from svn, run the buildout included in the checkout.
        
        This installs ``copy_ckeditor_code`` script. This script takes care of copying
        ckeditor code in the appropriate ``browser/ckeditor`` directory.
        
        The ``browser/ckeditor`` directory makes ckeditor javascript code available to
        the browser at::
        
          http://yourplonesite/++resource++ckeditor/
        
        You need to run ``bin/copy_ckeditor_code`` prior to run any Zope/Plone instance
        with your development ``collective.ckeditor``.
        Anyway, if you forget, your instance will break with a ``ConfigurationError``::
          
          Directory .../browser/ckeditor does not exist.
          
        Release
        =======
        
        Obviously, the ckeditor code also needs to be included in the released eggs.
        
        ``collective.ckeditor`` registers an entry point for ``zest.releaser`` that (if
        called properly) takes care of copying the code when preparing the release.
        
        However, in order to take advantage of the entry point, you have to use the 
        ``bin/fullrelease`` locally installed by the development buildout instead of 
        a globally installed ``fullrelease``. 
        
        Only the local ``bin/fullrelease`` script can see the entry_point registered by
        ``collective.ckeditor``.
