Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        OfArchiver generates HTML archives of chat rooms on an
        `Openfire <http://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/openfire>`_
        instant messaging server.
        
        Example usage is as follows::
        
            from ofarchiver import OfArchiver
        
            ofa = OfArchiver()
            for room in ofa.get_rooms():
                ofa.gen_archive(room)
        
        A script called *ofarchiver* is also installed, which takes advantage of the
        ``multiprocessing`` Python module to speed up archive generation on
        installations with many chat rooms.  It can serve as a cron job to generate
        archives at a given interval.
        
        Requirements
        ============
        
        * An Openfire server with chat rooms (tested with 3.7.0).
        * MySQL as the Openfire database (tested with 5.0).
        * A web server (tested with Apache 2.2 and its ``mod_autoindex`` module).
        * Python 2.6 or higher (available for RHEL/CentOS 5 in
          `EPEL <http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL>`_ as ``python26``).
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        * With ``pip``::
        
            sudo pip install OfArchiver
        
        * With ``easy_install``::
        
            sudo easy_install OfArchiver
        
        * From source::
        
            git clone http://github.com/egnyte/ofarchiver
            cd ofarchiver
            python setup.py build
            sudo python setup.py install
        
        Configuration
        =============
        
        Openfire
        --------
        
        The ``Monitoring Service`` Openfire plugin must be installed and configured.
        
        1. Log into the Openfire admin panel and select the *Plugins* tab.
        2. Install the ``Monitoring Service`` plugin.
        3. Select the *Server* tab, then the *Archiving* subtab.
        4. Under *Archiving Settings*, enable **Archive group chats**.
        
        OfArchiver
        ----------
        
        An *ofarchiver.ini* configuration file is included which must be copied to
        one of the following locations (listed in the order in which they are checked):
        
        * The user's home directory (**$HOME**)
        * */usr/local/etc*
        * */etc*
        
        It consists of the following sections (mandatory options have a ******):
        
        main
        ~~~~
        
          basedir **
            The base directory in which to generate the HTML archive.
        
          confserver **
            The name of the Openfire conference server.
        
          db **
            The type of database used by Openfire (only ``mysql`` is currently
            supported).
        
          debug
            Whether to enable debugging statements.
        
          logfile
            A file in which to log informational and/or debugging messages.
        
          org
            The name of the organization running Openfire.
        
          rooms
            A list of rooms for which to generate archives.
        
        db
        ~~
        
          hostname **
            The hostname of the MySQL server.
        
          username **
            A MySQL user, either Openfire's or one created just for OfArchiver
            (only ``SELECT`` privileges on the *ofMessageArchive* table is needed).
        
          password **
            The password for the MySQL user above.
        
          database **

          names
            A list of colors to choose from.
        
        Web Server
        ----------
        
        A web server with automatic directory index generation is required to view
        the HTML archive.  Here is a sample configuration for Apache, with
        */var/www/html/ofarchive* as the archive base directory::
        
            <Directory /var/www/html/ofarchive>
              Options +Indexes
              IndexOptions FancyIndexing
              IndexOrderDefault Descending Date
            </Directory>
        
        Adding authentication and encryption is highly recommended.
