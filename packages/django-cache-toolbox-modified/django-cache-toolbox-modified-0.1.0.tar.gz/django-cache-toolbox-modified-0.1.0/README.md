# django-cache-toolbox

Forked from <https://github.com/playfire/django-cache-toolbox>.

## Why did I fork?

* I have several modifications regarding their cache-invalidation rules I want to experiment with.
* I contacted the author asking that they publish the project to PyPI for ease of installation and never heard back. As such, I am managing this forked version at <TODO>.

## Changes from playfire's

* TODO
