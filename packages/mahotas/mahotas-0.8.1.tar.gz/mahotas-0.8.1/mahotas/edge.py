    Compute edges using Sobel's algorithm

    `edges` is a binary image of edges computed according to Sobel's algorithm.

    This implementation is tuned to match MATLAB's implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    img : Any 2D-ndarray
    just_filter : boolean, optional
        If true, then return the result of filtering the image with the sobel
        filters, but do not threashold.

    Returns
    -------
    edges : ndarray
        Binary image of edges, unless `just_filter`, in which case it will be
        an array of floating point values.
