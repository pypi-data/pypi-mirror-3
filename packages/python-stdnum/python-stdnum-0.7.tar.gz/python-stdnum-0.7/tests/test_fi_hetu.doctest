This file contains more detailed doctests for the stdnum.fi.hetu. It
tries to cover more corner cases and detailed functionality that is not
really useful as module documentation.

>>> from stdnum.fi import hetu


Normal values that should just work.

>>> hetu.is_valid('131052-308T')
True
>>> hetu.is_valid('131052+308T')
True
>>> hetu.is_valid('131052A308T')
True
>>> hetu.is_valid('131052a308t')
True


Invalid checksum:

>>> hetu.is_valid('131052-308U')
False


Invalid century indicator:

>>> hetu.is_valid('131052/308T')
False
>>> hetu.is_valid('131052T308T')
False


Invalid birth date:

>>> hetu.is_valid('310252-308Y')
False
>>> hetu.is_valid('130052-308R')
False

Leaving out the first zero is wrong:

>>> hetu.is_valid('10101-0101')
False


Invalid individual number:
(for historical reasons individual IDs start from 002)

>>> hetu.is_valid('131052-000V')
False


compact() and format() don't do much special:

>>> hetu.compact('131052a308t')
'131052A308T'
