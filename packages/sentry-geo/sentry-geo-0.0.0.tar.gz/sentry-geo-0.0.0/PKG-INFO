Description: sentry-geo
        ==========
        
        A plugin for Sentry which works with geo data. This adds
        a ``sentry_geo.interfaces.Geo`` interface which allows you to
        draw maps on your event pages.
        
        This is just a hack to see how easy it would be to add custom
        interfaces to Sentry via plugins.  Support for additional geo
        data types could be added, but this is probably not the ideal
        way to write interfaces.
        
        
        Interface
        ---------
        
        Geographic points use following interface::
        
            {
                "sentry_geo.interfaces.Geo": {
                    "lat": 12.321,
                    "lon": 45.654,
                }
            }
        
        
        Install
        -------
        
        Install the package via ``pip``::
        
            pip install sentry-geo
        
        Add ``sentry_geo`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS``::
        
            INSTALLED_APPS = (
                # ...
                'sentry',
                'sentry_geo',
            )
        
        You'll need to add the following lines to your ``urls.py``::
        
            import sentry_geo
            sentry_geo_static_root = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(sentry_geo.__file__), 'static')
        
            urlpatterns = patterns('',
                url(r'^_sentry_geo_static/(?P<path>.*)$', generic.static_media,
                    kwargs={'root': sentry_geo_static_root},
                    name='sentry-geo-static'),
            ) + urlpatterns
        
        I'm still looking for a solution that doesn't involve overwriting ``urls.py.``
