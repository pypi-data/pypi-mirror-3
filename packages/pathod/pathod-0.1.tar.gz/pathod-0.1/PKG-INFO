Description: 
        **pathod** is a pathological HTTP/S daemon, useful for testing and torturing
        HTTP clients. At **pathod**'s heart is a tiny, terse language for crafting HTTP
        responses. The simplest way to use **pathod** is to fire up the daemon, and
        specify the response behaviour you want using this language in the request URL.
        Here's a minimal example:
        
            http://localhost:9999/p/200
        
        Everything after the "/p/" path component is a response specifier - in this
        case just a vanilla 200 OK response. See the complete docs to get (much)
        fancier. You can also add anchors to the **pathod** server that serve a fixed
        response whenever a matching URL is requested:
        
            pathod --anchor "/foo=200"
        
        Here, "/foo" a regex specifying the anchor path, and the part after the "=" is
        a response specifier.
        
        **pathod** also has a nifty built-in web interface, which lets you play with
        the language by previewing responses, exposes activity logs, online help and
        various other goodies. Try it by visiting the server root:
        
            http://localhost:9999
