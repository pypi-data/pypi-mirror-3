Current Release
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.3.0

This release has incorporated a number of changes derived from using
Lokai as the basis for a new project. Generally, the way in which a
user interface is built has been changed to allow better flexibility.
The mechanism remains comaptible with versio 0.2, so the new version
number does not deserve a change in the major number.

Things missing from this release include:

* Documentation of the job management support.

* More detailed documentation of configuration.

* Documentation for extensions.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This release has incorporated a number of changes derived from using
Lokai as the basis for a new project. Generally, the way in which a
user interface is built has been changed to allow better flexibility.
The mechanism remains comaptible with versio 0.2, so the new version
number does not deserve a change in the major number.

There have also been a number of bug fixes arising from new use patterns.

Notable changes include:

* User interface related.  

  * Users can be added multiple times to a node using different roles.

  * Extension object views can be ordered either by 'id' or by order
    of definition.

  * A CSS concatenation tool has been added to allow merging of CSS
    definitions.

  * Templates now appear on a path so it is no longer necessary to
    copy templates when creating a new site.

  * The publisher will re-try a complete request if duplicate key or
    similar errors are raised in the commit.

  * The search page now works.

Map the activity view into the worker view extension point. This was
left out when the mapping structure was re-written to allow the basic
views to be used in different view extension points.

Notable functional changes:

* User interface related.  

  * Function tabs on worker pages can now have url arguments so that
    they can point to different pages and pass extended arguments to
    the target page.

  * More or less as a result of the above, the 'Add node' link on the
    list page is now a function tab.

  * Allow controllers to hide themselves so that a user is not
    presented with the related object type when adding a new
    node. This is aimed at hiding business process objects that are
    handled internally to the application. It also helps to limit
    opportunities for subverting a pre-defined node structure.

* Job Handler related:

  * Allow jobs to work through their inputs in reverse order.

  * Add a new MONITOR log level so that data processing jobs can
    report things that need doing without abandoning the processing.
 
* Other:

  * Some internal restructuring to make the code smell better.

  * A number of bug fixes.
