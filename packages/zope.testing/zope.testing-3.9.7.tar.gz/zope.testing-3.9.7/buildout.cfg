# The [test2X] sections below are to make testing with various Python versions
# easier.  You'll need entries in your default.cfg that point to the location
# that your various versions of Python are installed.  Like so:
#
# [python2.4]
# executable = /usr/local/bin/python2.4
#
# And then run "bin/buildout install test24 test25 test26 test27" to build the
# version-specific test scripts.  Once that's done you ran run "bin/test24"
# (etc.).
