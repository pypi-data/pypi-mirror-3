            Dustbowl
            ==========
        
            Dustbowl is an InteractiveConsole_ that allows for loading plugins.  These
            plugins are python packages that ``[dustbowl.modules]`` entry points.  One
            can create plugins for commonly repeated tasks.  The benefit to using an
            InteractiveConsole_ is that once a method from a plugin has been run, one
            can further inspect and manipulate its results and data.  Thus we have all
            the power of the Python REPL with assisting functions and commands.
