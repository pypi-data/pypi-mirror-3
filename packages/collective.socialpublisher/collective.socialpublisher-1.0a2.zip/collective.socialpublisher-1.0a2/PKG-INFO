Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        Provides a viewlet (and under-the-hood machinery) for managers that allows to publish contents to social networks (only twitter ATM). Social publication can be automated by enabling it per-content.
        
        To enable the viewlet just mark the content-type you want with `collective.socialpublisher.interfaces.IPublishable`. You can do it from ZMI or trough ZMCL::
        
            <class class="Products.ATContentTypes.content.event.ATEvent">
                <implements interface="collectinve.socialpublisher.interfaces.IPublishable" />
            </class>
        
            NOTE: this is already done by the package in this alpha stage.
        
        Twitter accounts management is done by `collective.twitter.accounts`.
        
        You can provide a publisher by registeriing an utility providing `collective.socialpublisher.interfaces.ISocialPublisherUtility`. See `collective.socialpublisher.utility` for details.
        
        To enable auto-publishing you have to enable it per-content (waiting for global configuration) and you have to create a cron the calls `@@social-auto-publish`. You can do it using `Products.cron4plone` or trough buildout like this::
        
            [instance]
            ...
            zope-conf-additional =
              <clock-server>
                  method /plonesite/@@social-auto-publish
                  period 1000
                  user admin
                  password admin
              </clock-server>
