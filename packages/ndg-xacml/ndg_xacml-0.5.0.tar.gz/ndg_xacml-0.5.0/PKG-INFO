Description: XACML 2.0 implementation for CEDA (the Centre for Environmental Data Archival) 
        STFC, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory.  This is follow on work from the NERC 
        (Natural Environment Research Council) DataGrid 3 Project.
        
        XACML (eXtensible Access Control Mark-up Language), is an XML based language for
        expressing access control policies.
        
        See: http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/xacml/
        
        Release 0.5.0
        -------------
        Major enhancements including additional language features and support for lxml:
        
         * Optional support for lxml as alternative to ElementTree - gives better Xpath support
         * Added concatenate functions and custom functions for URL encoding and MD5 hash custom functions.
         * Added support for language features:
           - for SAML 2.0 profile of XACML v2.0 (http://docs.oasis-open.org/xacml/2.0/access_control-xacml-2.0-saml-profile-spec-os.pdf)
           - AttributeSelectors
           - PolicySets. 
           - first-applicable rule combining algorithm
           - Incorporated NOT and modified AND functions (from Prashant Kediyal). 
         * Support for adding custom functions with ndg.xacml.core.functions.FunctionMap.load_custom_function
         * Fix for ticket:1130 and related bug
          - In ndg.xacml.core.target.Target._matchChild, all SubjectMatches within a 
          Subject must evaluate to true for an overall match for the Subject (and 
          similarly for Resource, Action and Environment).
          - In ndg.xacml.core.match.MatchBase, matching of the attribute value for a 
          SubjectMatch with any of the values for the selected attribute of the Subject 
          should result in an overall match (and similarly for Resource, Action and 
          Environment).
        
        Release 0.4.0
        -------------
        Added support for custom DataTypes and functions. e.g.
        
                # Add attribute value type
                AttributeValueClassFactory.addClass('<my new type uri', 
                                                    MyAttributeValueClass)
                
                # ...and new parser for this type
                DataTypeReaderClassFactory.addReader('<my new type uri', 
                                                     ETreeMyDataTypeReaderClass)
                
                # Add new function
                functionMap['<my function type uri'] = MyNewFunctionClass
        
        Release 0.3
        -----------
        Includes important fixes for equals functions, and improvement to at least one
        member functions.  Unit tests improved with wider coverage of different rule
        definitions and example request contexts.
        
        Improved and added to support for context handler and Policy Information Point
        interfaces including the ability for the PDP to call back to a PIP via a 
        Context handler to retrieve additional subject attributes.
        
        Release 0.2
        -----------
        Only the parts of the specification immediately required for CEDA have been 
        implemented in this initial release:
         Policy Decision Point;
         Deny overrides and Permit overrides rule combining algorithms;
         AttributeDesignators;
         various function types: see ndg.xacml.core.functions;
         and attribute types: see ndg.xacml.core.attribute;
         incomplete support for <AttributeSelector>s, <VariableReference>, 
         <VariableDefinition>. <Obligations>;
         includes an ElementTree based parser for Policies. No support for writing
         out policies or read/write of XML representation of <Request> and <Response>;
           
        See ndg.xacml.test for unit tests and examples.
        
        The software follows a modular structure to allow it to be extended easily to 
        include new parsers, functions and attribute types
