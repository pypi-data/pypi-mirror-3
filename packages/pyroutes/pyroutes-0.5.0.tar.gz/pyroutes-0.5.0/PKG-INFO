Description: pyroutes
        =========
        A really small framework for rapid development of small python
        web applications
        
        Why?
        -----
        I got tired of dealing with the same boring WSGI stuff every time
        I wanted to make a small web-utility in django, but I didn't want
        to go to far away from it, so I made this little thing to ease the
        work a bit.
        
        How it works
        -------------
        
        Example::
        
            from pyroutes import application, route
        
            @route('/')
            def index(request, name='world'):
                return 'Hello %s!' % name
        
        
        The above creates a complete WSGI compliant application. Result::
        
            GET /
            Hello world!
        
            GET /foo
            Hello foo!
        
        
        See http://readthedocs.org/docs/pyroutes/ for more information.
        
        
        Templating
        ----------
        
        pyroutes includes a small xml-based templating system called xml-template.
        For more information about xml-template, check out its bzr repo from 
        http://bzr.sesse.net/xml-template
        XML-Template is released under the GPLv2 license.
        
        
        For more information about usage, see the wiki example.
