Introduction
============

This library packages `Root directory for Fanstatic packages`_ for `fanstatic`_.

.. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
.. _`Root directory for Fanstatic packages`: https://github.com/MiCHiLU/js

This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
directory in ``js``) are published to some URL.
