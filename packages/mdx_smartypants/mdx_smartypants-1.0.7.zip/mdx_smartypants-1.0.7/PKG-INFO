        Installation
        ============
        
        ::
        
            pip install mdx_smartypants
            
        (You may need to prefix this with "sudo " to authorize installation.)
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        ::
          
            import markdown
            import mdx_smartypants
            
            text = """
            Markdown makes HTML from simple text files. But--it lacks typographic
            "prettification." That... That'd be sweet. Definitely 7---8 on a '10-point
            scale'. Now it has it.
            
            Huzzah!
            """
            
            print markdown.markdown(text, extensions=['smartypants'])
        
        This produces nice HTML output, including typographically "pretty" quotes and
        other punctuation. It also renders HTML entites in their named rather than
        numeric form, which is easier on the eyes and more readily comprehended::
        
            <p>Markdown makes HTML from simple text files. But&mdash;it lacks
            typographic &ldquo;prettification.&rdquo; That&hellip; That&rsquo;d be
            sweet. Definitely 7&ndash;8 on a &lsquo;10-point scale&rsquo;. Now it has
            it.</p>
            <p>Huzzah!</p>
        
        Bugs
        ====
        
        The smartypants module (as of version 1.6.0.3) wrongly
        munges punctuation within style sections found in the document
        body.
        As of version 1.0.7, mdx_smartypants monkey-patches a fix for this.
