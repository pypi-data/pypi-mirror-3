Description: About this project
        ==================
        
        canon-remote_ is a USB library for Canon digital cameras in Python
        with  pyusb_, speaking the so-called `normal mode`. It originally
        started  as a Python port of gphoto2_'s `Canon library`_ for a
        PowerShot G3. Only the subset necessary for this model was ported, but
        it should be usable with other models from that era (not without
        hacking) and will almost surely not work on much newer cameras, not
        without serious hacking. The project was created because gphoto2 lacks
        support for certain remote capture features, namely locking the
        autofocus and setting the autofocus mode to macro.
        
        The latest project documentation can be found at the `project homepage`_.
        Or you can build it from source.
        
        `The source`_ is hosted at `bitbucket`_.

        unofficial implementation of their closed USB camera protocol. I am not
        affiliated with Canon Inc. No information or code from them was used
        for this work. The protocol was reverse-engineered by the guys behind
        gphoto2_, thanks guys!
        
        .. warning::
            Use this at **your own risk**. I haven't damaged my camera with it yet,
            but it's not impossible.
