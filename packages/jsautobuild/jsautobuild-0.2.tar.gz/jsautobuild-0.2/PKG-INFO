        ==========================
        
        This is meant to be used to help you write your own watching js builder
        script. It provides the hooks and the pyinotify inclusion. You can tweak it to
        your own specific application as required.
        
        Usage
        ------
        You need to build a simple script to use the builder. Below is an example
        script that helps copy changed JS files to a build directory.
        
        ::
        
            import os
        
            from jsautobuild import YUIBuilder
        
        
            def lp_path_builder(changed_path, **builder_props):
                """The custom bit of LP code that determines where files get moved to"""
                # to start out let's assume your CWD is where we're referencing things from
                CWD = os.getcwd()
                JSDIR = os.path.join(CWD, builder_props['build_dir'])
                RENAME = re.compile("^.*lib/lp/(.*)/javascript")
        
                match = RENAME.search(changed_path)
                js_dir = match.groups()[0]
                return os.path.join(JSDIR, RENAME.sub(js_dir, changed_path))
        
        
            if __name__ == "__main__":
                build_dir = 'build/js/lp'
                meta_name = 'LP_MODULES'
                watch_dir = 'lib'
        
                builder = YUIBuilder(lp_path_builder,
                        build_dir,
                        watch_dir=watch_dir,
                        meta_jsmodule=meta_name)
        
                builder.run()
        
        Options
        -------
        :build_callable:
        You need a function that will accept the filename of the JS file that has
        changed, and then return back the proper location of that file in the build
        directory.
        
        :build_dir:
        What is the root directory all build files are heading to. This is also used
        for the meta.js generate code. It'll build a list of all modules in this build
        directory.
        
        :meta_jsmodule:
        What is the Javascript global variable name you want the meta file to be
        generated to. You'll use this in your own application to feed the module list
        to the YUI combo loader.
        
        :update_metajs:
        **default True**
        Should we rebuild the meta.js whenever a new .js file is created.
        
        :watch_dir:
        **default .**
        This is the directory that is watched for all file changes and triggers the
        build of js files. By default it'll watch the current working directory and
        anything below that.
