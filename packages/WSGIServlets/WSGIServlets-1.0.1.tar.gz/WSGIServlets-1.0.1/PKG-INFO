        ========================
        Welcome to WSGIServlets!
        ========================
        
        WSGIServlets offers a programmer an object oriented paradigm for web
        application development.
        
        WSGIServlets is a rewrite and significant enhancement of Mod_python
        Servlets for WSGI servers and gateways.  For historical rationale you
        can look at README.mpservlets.
        
        
        
        Running the Tutorial
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        To get started, try running the tutorial::
        
           cd tutorial
           ./runtutorial
        
        This will start the tutorial on port 8000.  If that's not available on
        your host, you can specify a different port::
        
           ./runtutorial 8888
        
        NOTE: the tutorial text is written in Markdown
        (http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).  While not required
        (at all!), for best viewing pleasure you'll want to install it in your
        python environment::
        
            pip install Markdown
        
        Or you can download the tarball from:
        http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/M/Markdown/Markdown-2.0.3.tar.gz
        
        
          
        Reading the Documentation
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Sphinx documentation is in the doc directory.  You can read the rst
        files in that directory or load doc/build/html/index.html in your
        favorite browser.  The tutorial acts as a webserver, so you can read
        the documentation from within the tutorial as well.
        
        
        
        Installation
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        If you're reading this I'm assuming you've downloaded and extracted a
        tarball, in which case, run from this directory::
        
           python setup.py install
