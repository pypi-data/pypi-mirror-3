Automatic Installer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The simplest way to install pycddlib, is to `download <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pycddlib/#downloads>`_ an installer matching your version of Python, and run it.

Building From Source
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MPIR/GMP
''''''''

To compile pycddlib on Windows, you need `MPIR <http://www.mpir.org/>`_. Download the latest MPIR source tarball (decompress the ``mpir-x.x.x.tar.bz2`` file with `7-Zip <http://www.7-zip.org/>`_), and run :file:`configure.bat` and :file:`make.bat` from the :file:`mpir-x.x.x\\win` folder. [#vc9]_ Once built, go to the :file:`mpir-x.x.x` folder, and copy :file:`mpir.h` and :file:`mpirxx.h` to::

    C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC\include

and :file:`mpir.lib` and :file:`mpirxx.lib` to either (for a 32-bit build)::

    C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC\lib

or (for a 64-bit build)::

    C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC\lib\amd64

On Linux, you need `GMP <http://gmplib.org/>`_ (although you can also use MPIR if you desire so, by tweaking the ``setup.py`` file). Your distribution probably has a pre-built package for it. For example, on Fedora, install it by running::

    yum install gmp-devel

pycddlib
''''''''

Once MPIR/GMP is installed, `download <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pycddlib/#downloads>`_ and extract the source ``.zip``. On Windows, start the MSVC command line, and run the setup script from within the extracted folder::

    cd ....\pycddlib-x.x.x
    C:\PythonXX\python.exe setup.py install

On Linux, start a terminal and run::

    cd ..../pycddlib-x.x.x
    python setup.py build
    su -c 'python setup.py install'

Building From Git
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To compile the *latest* code, clone the project with `Git <http://git-scm.com>`_ by running::

    git clone --recursive git://github.com/mcmtroffaes/pycddlib

Then simply run the :file:`build.sh` script: this will build the library, install it, generate the documentation, and run all the doctests. Note that, besides `MPIR <http://www.mpir.org/>`_, you also need `Cython <http://www.cython.org/>`_ to compile the source, and `Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/>`_ to generate the documentation.

   When compiling extension modules, it is easiest to use same compiler that was used to compile Python. For Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.0, 3.1, and 3.2, this is Microsoft Visual C/C++ 2008 (the `express edition <http://download.microsoft.com/download/A/5/4/A54BADB6-9C3F-478D-8657-93B3FC9FE62D/vcsetup.exe>`_ will do just fine).
