Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        plonetheme.bootstrap integrates the bootstrap css/js framework
        into plone. You can checkout the framework at `http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/`
        
        It overrides some templates and uses javascript to transform
        some markup in order for it to work correctly.
        
        It's not perfect, but it's close.
