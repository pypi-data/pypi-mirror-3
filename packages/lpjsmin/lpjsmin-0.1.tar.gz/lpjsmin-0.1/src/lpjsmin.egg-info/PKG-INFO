Description: lpjsmin for minifying js files
        ===============================
        
        We need to handle several minification goals within the Launchpad codebase.
        This helps to create a single lib to help handle all of the cases and allow it
        to be flexibly used in more projects.
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        cmd line
        ~~~~~~~~~
        You can pass the cmd line `lpjsmin` either a filename or a directory and it'll
        process the file(s) adding a $fname-min.js next to the original file. This is
        used for things like minifying files in the combo directory. You can just let
        it know the root of the combo directory and it'll minify all files it finds in
        there.
        
        ::
        
            $ lpjsmin static/js/
            $ lpjsmin static/js/myapp.js
        
        python usage
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        You can import the module and minify in your own build scripts either via just
        filename and directory.
        
        ::
        
            import lpjsmin
            lpjsmin.minify('static/js')
            lpjsmin.minify('static/js/myapp.js')
        
        If you need to be able to customize the name or location of the minified
        files, wrap the lpjsmin script in your own build script and pass it the in/out
        streams.
        
        ::
        
            import lpjsmin
            lpjsmin.minify_stream(
                open('static/js/myapp.js'),
                open('/tmp/myapp.minified.js', 'w')
            )
