Introduction
------------

plugged in to it one or more Python setuptools entry points.  For
example, you could make sense out of the following YAML using
repoze.configuration and a custom directive:

.. code-block:: text

   --- !appsettings
   port_number = 8080
   reload_templates = true

   --- !include
   filename = anotherfile.yml
