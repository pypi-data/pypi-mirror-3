Description: 
        pyramid_mailer is a package for taking the pain out of sending emails
        in your Pyramid project.
        
        This includes:
        
        1. Wrapping the low-level Python email library with an easy-to-use
           API, which includes attachments and mulipart content.
        
        2. Send emails immediately or to add to a maildir queue.
        
        3. Managing email sends inside a transaction, to prevent emails being sent
           if your code fails.
        
        4. Features to help with unit testing.
        
        pyramid_mailer uses the repoze_sendmail library for managing email sending
        and transacton management, and borrows code from Zed Shaw's Lamson for
        wrapping email messages.
