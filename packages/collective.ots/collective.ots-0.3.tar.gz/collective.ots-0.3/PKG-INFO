Summary: Writing a good summary (description) is hard,
                let the Open Text Summarizer (OTS) do the heavy lifting.
                This tool extracts a summary of the content and sets it
                as the description of the content item you added

        Project Description
        ===================
        
        The summary may not be perfect but it is a good starting point for a
        description. Mostly the summary is pretty good though.
        The description is only auto generated when you ADD a new Archetypes
        content item WITHOUT a description. You may edit this description at any
        time. You can invoke the summarizer on existing content items by
        selecting 'Summarize' from the 'Actions' menu
        
        Install using buildout
        =======================
        
        Just add collective.ots (and optionally ots) to the egges section of you buildout ::
        
            eggs:
                ...
                ots
                collective.ots
        
        Run buildout, restart your server and activate the product in your add ons section.
        You do not have to use the ots egg (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/ots)
        if you have problems installing it. Any ots found in your system will do,
        so you may install it with: ::
        
            sudo apt-get install libots0
        
        or the package manager of your distribution, or install it from source.
        
        check that ots is installed and working with: ::
        
            ots -?
        
        which will give you the output: ::
