Description: File morgue (fmorgue) is a tool for mirroring files permanently to a remote server.
        In contrast to rsync and friends, it identifies missing files on the server only
        based on modification time and size, which makes it suitable for archiving rotated log files.
        
        The package installs two new shell commands, 'fmorgue' for the client application, and 'fmorgue-server'.
        
        The client application
        ======================
        The fmorgue client is expected to be called on a regular base, e.g. as cron job. It inspects
        the given list of files and asks the server which files need to be transfered. In case some
        of the files are missing, they are immediately transferred to the server.
        
        Example:
        
        fmorgue http://my.archive.example.com/ /var/log/*.log
        
        Try 'fmorgue -h'.
        
        The server application
        ======================
        The fmorgue server can either run as standalone application on a dedicated port, or as CGI script.
        In both operation modes, the server must be told were to store the retreived data.
        
        In standalone mode, you have to define the directory as command-line parameter.
        
        In CGI mode, you have to create a config file in '/etc/fmorgue' The configuration file should look like this::
        
        	# Configuration file for fmorgue 
        	[fmorgue-server]
        	dir=/tmp/
        	# Possible values: yes/no
        	withhostname=no
        	# Possible values: yes/no
        	withorigname=no
        
        You also need to configure your web server, e.g. by adding a ScriptAlias directive. 
        
        By default, the files are renamed according to their modification time, since the original file
        name is expected to be changing (think logrotate). You can add the original host name and file name
        to the generated file name on server side. 
        
        Disclaimer
        ==========
        There is no security in this application. If you expose your fmorgue-server to the Internet, you are on your own.
