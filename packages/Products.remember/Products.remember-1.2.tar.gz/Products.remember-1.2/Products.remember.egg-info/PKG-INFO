Description: ========
        Remember
        ========
        
        Remember is a full implementation of the default Plone member
        configuration using content to represent the members, built on top of
        Membrane.  Out of the box, Remember should work very much like a
        regular Plone site, except that member information is stored in Member
        objects that are (by default) stored in the portal_memberdata tool.
        
        Remember is a successor to CMFMember, which will not work with
        PluggableAuthService-based user folders, and thus will not work with a
        typical Plone 2.5 (and greater) installation.  There is a migration
        path provided for folks with existing CMFMember-based sites who would
        like to migration to Plone 2.5.X and Remember.  For instructions on
        performing such migrations, please refer to the README.txt file in
        the cmfmember subdirectory.
        
        NOTE: This version of Remember requires Plone 3; it does NOT support
        Plone 2.5 or Plone 4.  If you have a CMFMember-based Plone 2.1
        solution, you should initially migrate to Remember 1.0 and Plone 2.5.
        Once this is working correctly, then you can upgrade to Remember 1.1
        and Plone 3 with little problem.

        ============
        INSTALLATION
        ============
        
        Remember is packaged using Python's setuptools package management
        infrastructure.  Remember can be made available to your Zope instance
        by installing the Products.remember package into your Zope's python
        environment, using either easy_install or 'python setup.py install'.
        
        Remember is installed into a Plone site by the application of a
        GenericSetup extension profile.  You can do this when creating a new
        site by selecting remember from the list of available setup profiles
        when you are creating the site.  In an existing site, you can use
        Plone's regular product installation interface.

        Changelog
        =========
        
        1.2 (2011-12-01)
        ----------------
        
        * Added doChangeUser method to the BaseMember class.  This is not the
          canonically correct place, but it is needed.
          [maurits]
        
        * Introduce the 'remember: Can authenticate' permission instead of the
          not existing 'membrane: Can authenticate' permission.  Check this
          new permission in verifyCredentials.
          [maurits]
        
        * Set default editor to Kupu (not TinyMCE) as this Products.remember
          version should be Plone 3 compatible and the tests should pass.
          [maurits]
        
        * Protect the password field of members so the hash can not be seen.
          [maurits]
        
        * Added getUserId method, which is apparently needed for more recent
          Products.membrane versions.
          [maurits]
        
        * Modernized GenericSetup configuration, moving the profile and import
          step registration from python code and xml to zcml, and creating
          upgrade steps to get rid of persistent import steps and update the
          existing getRoles index from a FieldIndex to a KeywordIndex.
          [maurits]
        
        * Changed getRoles from a FieldIndex to a KeywordIndex in the
          membrane_tool, so you can search for roles.
          [maurits]
        
        * Use Plone 3's JS schemata/fieldset switching.
          http://plone.org/products/remember/issues/55 [Matthew Wilkes]
        
        * allow usage of portal_registration tools  ALLOWED_MEMBER_ID_PATTERN. This 
          does not change any current behaviour, it may be made configurable ttw in 
          future. Introduced new config.py variable USE_PORTAL_REGISTRATION_PATTERN
          set to False by default. Setting to True switches to portal_registrations
          getIDPattern.
          [jensens]
        
        * Fix inefficiency in prefs_users_overview where searchUsers is called when 
          no search string is supplied. The bug meant that the page would be extremely 
          slow even when just navigating to prefs_users_overview.
