Description: ChoppedPress
        ============
        
        **ChoppedPress** lets you split the **WordPress** XML export file into smaller files that can be used to import your posts, comments, tags and categories into a new WordPress installation.
        
        Assuming you have already gone throught the process of exporting all of your posts, comments and tags into a file named _my-blog-YEAR-MONTH-DATE.xml_, you could then split it into several smaller XML files using the following command:
        
        ::
            choppedpress my-exported-wordpress.xml
        
        This will generate **two** (this is the default) XML files named **out01.xml** and **out02.xml**. The name of the generated files and/or how many files to generate can be specified by using the appropriate flags as show by *choppedpress --help*.
        
        
        ::
            Usage:  choppedpress <INFILE> [[<OUTFILE>] [<TAG>] [<NUMBER>]]
        
            ChoppedPress lets you split the WordPress XML export file into smaller files
            that can be used to import your posts, comments, tags and categories into a
            new WordPress installation.

              -h, --help            show this help message and exit
              -i <FILE>, --infile=<FILE>
                                    The XML file generated by WordPress
              -o <FILE>, --outfile=<FILE>
                                    The name for the smaller XML files. [default: out]
              -t TAG, --tag=TAG     The XML tag that represents your data. [default:
                                    /rss/channel/item]
              -n NUMBER, --number=NUMBER
                                    How many new files should be generated. [default: 2]
