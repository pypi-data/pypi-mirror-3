Version 1.0
===========

*) Bumped major version to 1
*) Fixed code causing deprecation warnings
*) Fixed a bug in a test when using Python 3
*) Widened what is accepted as a generator by paycheck
   (In particular, now any type can specify how to generate
   random data for itself by providing a
   make_new_random_generator method.)
*) Added choice generators for generating random selections
   from a list of values.
*) Now in Python 3 an exception of type Exception is raised in
   the paycheck handler rather than a new exception of the
   type originally thrown.
