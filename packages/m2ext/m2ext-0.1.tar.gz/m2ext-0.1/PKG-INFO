Description: ============================
         m2ext: M2Crypto extensions
        ============================
        
        This package contains some extended functions which are not (yet)
        available in `M2Crypto <http://chandlerproject.org/Projects/MeTooCrypto>`_ 
        trunk.
        
        It should be built using the same SWIG and OpenSSL version as
        M2Crypto.
