Multilingual natural language tools, wrapping NLTK and other systems.

This package provides wrappers around NLTK and other systems to provide
convenient natural language tools, such as:

- Tokenizers
- Stopword removers
- Word frequency lookup
- Lemmatizers (which reduce words to their root form, possibly taking
  part-of-speech tags into account)
- Analyzers for East Asian languages (for example, we currently use a MeCab
  process to find word breaks in Japanese)
