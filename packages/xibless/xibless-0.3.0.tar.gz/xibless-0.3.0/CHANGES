Changes
=======

Version 0.3.0 -- 2012/07/09
---------------------------

* Added RadioButtons, TableView, TabView, TextView, ImageView and ProgressIndicator.
* Added support for string localization.
* Added TextField.alignment and TextField.textColor.
* Added Button.keyEquivalent.
* Added canClose, canResize and canMinimize to Window.
* Added a Control subclass.
* View can now be directly instantiated in UI scripts (They're like "Custom Views" in IB).
* `xibless run` can now be run on script for which the result is a View.
* Improved layout system.
* Window origin is now supplied in terms of screen proportions rather than absolute positions.
* Fixed 'id' ownerclass in main function prototype generation and added the "ownerimport" global
  variable in the UI script.
* Escape newlines in string code generation.
* Added documentation for Button.buttonType and Button.bezelStyle and added a demo for a button
  with a different bezel style.
* Fixed the most glaring memory leaks.
* Fixed a bug where attributes like class-level default fonts wouldn't be generated when generating
  more than one UI script in the same python session.
* Windows are not released when closed by default.
* Added support for circular references (a window setting one of its properties to an item that
  required that window before being created, for example, initialFirstResponder). We previously
  couldn't generate code for such bindings.
* Made the `align` argument in `View.packRelativeTo()` optional.
