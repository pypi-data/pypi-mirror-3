        Purpose
        =======
        
        Building telephony applications with Twilio is easy, but not simple.
        
        django-twilio is my attempt at reducing some of the complexities of telephony
        development with Twilio--namely, implementing common patterns, helpers, etc., so
        that you can truly focus on the core application logic and leave out all the
        rest.
