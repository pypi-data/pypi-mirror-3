Description: ``node.ext.zodb`` is a persistent `node <http://pypi,python.org/pypi/node>`_ 
        implemenatation for the `ZODB <http://www.zodb.org>`_. 
        
        With node a unified robust tree structure can be build and with this package 
        this structures can be persistet easily.
        
        It provides two implementation types:
        
        - ``node.ext.zodb.ZODBNode`` based on ``persistent.dict.PersistentDict``,
        - ``node.ext.zodb.OOBTNode`` based on ``BTrees.OOBTree.OOBTree``.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        First a open DB connection is needed. This may be a naked ZODB install or 
        in an context of `Pyramid <http://docs.pylonsproject.org/en/latest/docs/pyramid.html>`_
        or `Zope2 <http://zope2.zope.org/>`_/ `Plone <http://plone.org>`_ or where ever 
        it makes sense for you.
        
        Once the DB ``root`` object or any other contained persistent object is available 
        adding nodes is as simple as so::
        
            >>> from node.ext.zodb import ZODBNode
            >>> root['person'] = ZODBNode()
            >>> root['person'].attrs['name'] = "Willi"
            >>> root['person']['home'] = ZODBNode()
            >>> root['person']['home'].attrs['address'] = "Innsbruck, Austria"
            >>> root['person']['work'] = ZODBNode()
            >>> root['person']['work'].attrs['address'] = "Hall in Tirol, Austria"
        
        Once the transaction is committed al changes are persistent.
        
        For more information on ``node`` and its usage please refer to the 
        `node documentation <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/node>`_.
