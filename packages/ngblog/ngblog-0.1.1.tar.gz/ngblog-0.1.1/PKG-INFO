        This is a simple and easy to use plain-text-like blogging engine, that was
        created to power http://nerdgordo.com/.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        As easy as pie::
        
            $ pip install ngblog
        
        ``ngblog`` relies on ``figlet`` to generate the blog title. Install it with
        your distro's package manager.
        
        This thing just works on Linux, probably.
        
        
        Start the blog
        --------------
        
        Create the directory and the configuration file::
        
            $ mkdir blog
            $ vim blog/config.ini
        
        Add something like this to the file::
        
            [settings]
            title = Blog Title
            headline = Blog Headline
            footline = Blog Footline -- Multi-line
              capable
            author_name = My Name
            author_email = example@example.com
        
        Create a sample post::
        
            $ mkdir -p blog/2011/10/30
            $ vim blog/2011/10/30/my-post.txt
        
        Add anything you want to the post::
        
            This is my title
        
            This is my body.
        
            I'm a simple parser, but I can recognize paragraphs. ;)
        
        The directory structure of the posts is important, because it is used for
        get the publishing date.
        
        You might want to store your text files in a Git repository, for history and
        stuff.
        
        
        Build the blog
        --------------
        
        ``ngblog`` script is your friend::
        
            $ ngblog --srcdir blog
        
        This will put the generated files in ``blog/_build``. Open the file
        ``blog/_build/index.html`` in any browser to review your blog.
        
        Build the files again, now with your domain as the base URL::
        
            $ ngblog --srcdir blog --baseurl http://example.com/
        
        Feel free to upload these files to your server with some tool like ``rsync``.
        
        Take a look at the ``ngblog`` help to see the available options::
        
            $ ngblog --help
