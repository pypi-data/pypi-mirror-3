        wheel
        =====
        
        A built-package package format for Python.
        
        Can be installed with a patched version of pip from
        https://github.com/dholth/pip
        
        Requires a patched distribute from https://bitbucket.org/dholth/distribute
        
        Work on the spec is at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mWPyvoeiqCrAy4UPNnvaz7Cgrqm4s_cfaTauAeJWABI/edit
        
        Why not egg?
        ============
        
        Python's egg format predates the packging related standards we have today,
        the most important being PEP 376 "Database of Installed Python Distributions"
        which specifies the .dist-info directory (instead of .egg-info) and PEP 345 
        "Metadata for Python Software Packages 1.2" which specifies how to express
        dependencies (instead of requires.txt in .egg-info).
        
        Wheel implements these things. It also provides a richer file naming
        convention that communicates the Python implementation and ABI as well as
        simply the language version used in a particular package.
        
        Unlike .egg, wheel will be a fully-documented standard at the binary level
        that is truly easy to install even if you do not want to use the reference
        implementation.
