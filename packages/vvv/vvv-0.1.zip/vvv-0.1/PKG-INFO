Description: ========================================
        VVV - validation and linting integrator
        ========================================
        
        VVV is a tool for easy validation and linting integration for your software project.
        With a single command validate all files, no matter in which programming language,
        in a source tree against a policy you specify in a simple configuration file.
        VVV prevents bad stuff to be committed in your software source control or makes cleaning it up easier.

        Benefits
        =========
        
        * Enforce coding conventions across multiple developers
        
        * Enable linting and validators support for your software project with a single command
        
        * Automatically guide committers to policy guidelines and let them fix errors themselves, instead of having
        post-commit personal coaching.
        
        * Provide sane default validation and linting options for all popular programming languages and file formats
        
        * Run VVV as continuous integration service with systems like Travis CI or Jenkins and shoot down bad code push-ins
        
        What VVV doesn't do
        
        * This is not automated testing tool. We just scan files against a **policy**, not for
        programming errors. Linting tools tend to pick up programming errors, too though,
        like mistyped names.
        
        Features
        =========
        
        * Set-up for your software repository with two files ``validation-options.yaml`` (configuration) and ``validation-files.yaml`` (whitelist/blacklist)
        
        * VVV automatically downloads and locally installs required software - you don't need to spend time hunting downloads or distribution packages
        
        * Check file against hard tabs and whitespace policies - no more different tab width ever
        
        * Prevent committing hard source code breakpoints, like Python's ``import pdb ; pdb.set_trace()``
        
        * Support (on its way) for Subversion, Git, Github, Travis CI, Jenkings and other popular version control and continuous integration
        systems
