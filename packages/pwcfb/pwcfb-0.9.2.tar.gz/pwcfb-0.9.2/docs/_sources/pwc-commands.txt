Additional PowerConsole Commands
################################

Firebird Pack also installs additional commands to the PowerConsole_. Some commands are equivalents of ISQL
commands, some are completely new.

.. Note:: All installed commands use case *insensitive* keywords.

.. index:: CONNECT

CONNECT
=======

Attach to the Firebird database.
Usage::

   CONNECT 'dsn or db' [HOST host][USER 'user'][PASSWORD 'password'][CACHE int ][ROLE 'role'][AS var][;]

If connection is sucessfuly established, this database connection is set as main working database. Database
object is stored and accessible under default alias "db" or as alias specified by optional AS argument. If
alias name is already used for other attached database, this database is disconnected.

.. index:: DISCONNECT

DISCONNECT
==========

Disconnects from attached Firebird database.
Usage::

    DISCONNECT [dbvar]
    
Without argument, it will disconnect from current working database. If argument is specified, it must be
a name of previously connected database (implicit name 'db' or name specified by AS argument) that should
be disconnected. If disconnected database is current working database, then current working database is set
to other connected database if there is any.

.. index:: READY

READY
=====

This command shows list of attached Firebird databases or selects the working database.
Usage::

    READY [dbvar]

Without argument, it will list all attached databases. If argument is specified, it must be a name of previously
connected database (implicit name 'db' or name specified by AS argument).

.. index::
   single: SHOW
   pair: SHOW; DATABASE
   pair: SHOW; TABLE
   pair: SHOW; INDEX
   pair: SHOW; DOMAIN
   pair: SHOW; PROCEDURE
   pair: SHOW; TRIGGER
   pair: SHOW; VIEW
   pair: SHOW; GENERATOR
   pair: SHOW; FUNCTION
   pair: SHOW; EXCEPTION
   pair: SHOW; COLLATION
   pair: SHOW; CHARACTER SET
   pair: SHOW; ROLE

SHOW commands
=============

This pack installs several extensions for standard SHOW command to examine database objects equivalent
to ISQL SHOW commands::

    SHOW DATABASE [<dbvar>]

        Detail about current or specified attached database.

    SHOW [SYSTEM] TABLES | TABLE <dbident> [IN <dbvar>]
    SHOW [SYSTEM] INDICES | INDEX <dbident> [IN <dbvar>]
    SHOW [SYSTEM] DOMAINS | DOMAIN <dbident> [IN <dbvar>]
    SHOW [SYSTEM] PROCEDURES | PROCEDURE <dbident> [IN <dbvar>]
    SHOW [SYSTEM] TRIGGERS | TRIGGER <dbident> [IN <dbvar>]
    SHOW [SYSTEM] VIEWS | VIEW <dbident> [IN <dbvar>]
    SHOW [SYSTEM] GENERATORS | GENERATOR <dbident> [IN <dbvar>]
    SHOW [SYSTEM] FUNCTIONS | FUNCTION <dbident> [IN <dbvar>]
    SHOW EXCEPTIONS | EXCEPTION <dbident> [IN <dbvar>]
    SHOW CHARACTER SETS | CHARACTER SET <dbident> [IN <dbvar>]
    SHOW COLLATIONS | COLLATION <dbident> [IN <dbvar>]
    SHOW ROLES | ROLE <dbident> [IN <dbvar>]

        List of object names or object details in current or specified attached database.

All these commands work on main attached database by default, but can also operate on other attached
databases via direct specification of Database object name.

.. Note:: For greater compatibility with ISQL, these commands accept *optional* semicolon terminator.


.. index::
   single: SET
   pair: SET; SQL DIALECT
   pair: SET; AUTODDL
   pair: SET; NAMES
   pair: SET; PLAN
   pair: SET; PLANONLY

SET commands
============

This pack supports subset of ISQL SET commands::

    SET                      Display current SET options.
    SET SQL DIALECT <num>    Sets SQL DIALECT used for new connection or created databases.
    SET AUTO[DDL] [ON | OFF] Toggle autocommit of DDL statements.
    SET NAMES <charset>      Set name of runtime character set.
    SET PLAN [ON | OFF]      Toggle display of query access plan.
    SET PLANONLY [ON | OFF]  Toggle display of query plan without executing.

.. Note:: For greater compatibility with ISQL, you may *optionally* end each command with semicolon.


.. index::
   single: SET TERM

SET TERM
========

It's actually a standard PowerConsole command, but it works and should be used in the same way as ISQL SET TERM
command.
