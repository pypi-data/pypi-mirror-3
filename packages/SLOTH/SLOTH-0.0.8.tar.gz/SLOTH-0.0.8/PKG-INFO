        SLOTH
        ========
        
        SLOTH (stick-like object tracking high resolution) was created to evaluate the dynamic behavior of biological objects, that have a stick-like shape.
        SLOTH provides a tracking module, as well as 2 analysis modules. The analysis module is designed for users interested in the length and shape of the objects.
        The tracker was designed for microtubule TIRF movies, but it can easlily be used for any movie like stretched DNA, etc.
        You might find it most useful for tasks involving analysing growth speeds and length distributions. 
        The module contains 3 scripts with a Tkinter based GUI that can be executed processively to track, select and analyse the behavior of objects in a movie /stack of images.
        
        A OVERVIEW
        =========
        
        SLOTH contains the following scripts:
        
        * image_analyser: a tracking routine supporting .tif and .nd2 files.
        
        * select_ROI: a viewing module, created to select ROIs from the tracked coordinates
        
        * automatic_analysis: a module to calculate the mean-square displacement from the data.
        
        The tracker supports the input of a drift file, where the drift is specified in a x,y format. This drift will automatically be subtracted while tracking.
        
        
        B supported formats
        ===================
        At this time sloth supports .tif and .nd2 formats, as created by most microscopy programs.

        D Tested applications
        =====================
        
        The program is intended for an was tested on dynamic microtubule assays (<http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091679X10950139> Gell et. al).
        The tracking precision is limited by the signal-to-noise ratio, and the identification of object relies on the fact that the objects can be approximated to be very thin.
        (There needs to a clear axis.)
