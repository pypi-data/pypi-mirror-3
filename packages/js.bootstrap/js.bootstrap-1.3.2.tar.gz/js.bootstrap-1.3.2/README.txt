js.bootstrap
************

Introduction
============

This library packages `twitter bootstrap`_ for `fanstatic`_. It is aware of different modes (normal, minified).

.. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
.. _`twitter bootstrap`: http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/

This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
directory in ``js.bootstrap``) are published to some URL.
