            Tired of circular imports? Startup times making you feel like you're working in Java?
            You might need to pop that flask into your hip pocket and take a brisk walk to clear your head.
        
        What is it?
        -----------
        
        HipPocket is a collection of convenience wrappers for the already intensely useful Flask_ web framework.
        
        It provides:
        
        ``Mapper``
            Enable centralized URL mapping
        
        ``LateLoader``
            Taken from `Flask's documentation`_
        
        and of course ``HipPocket``
            A wrapper to enable running setup tasks on a Flask application at startup.
        
        ``HipPocket`` itself also comes with two pre-defined tasks:
        
        ``autoload``
            Load blueprints from a package and auto-register them with Flask
            To add a new blueprint to an autoloading application simply drop in a sub-package and reload your server
            (remember, since you are use ``Mapper`` your startup times should be significantly decreased.)
        
        ``setup_errors``
            Add basic error responses for all HTTP error codes.
        
        Can I use it?
        -------------
        
        It depends on your requirements. Some things to consider:
        
        * HipPocket is licenced under the MIT licence so it's free to use for almost any purpose.
        * It is currently pre-alpha software.
        * It has not tests (yet).
        * It has no documentation (aside from its docstrings).
        * Its API is not stable.
        * It is actively accepting patches and feedback.
