Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        Our vision for uwosh.northstar is as a complete through-the-web (TTW)
        tool for generating workflow applications, ie. a custom content type
        combined with an assigned custom workflow.  
        
        Right now it adds a control panel entry ``Workflow Manager`` where you
        can access the workflow tool. It also adds a ``Workflow App Generator``
        control panel entry where you can generate your workflow app products.
        
        Creating content types is easily done by using Dexterity. The tool will
        simply dump your dexterity content type. If you can not use dexterity,
        the tool also supports using PloneFormGen as your modeling tool in which
        it'll create a corresponding Archetype for the PloneFormGen form you've
        created.
        
        uwosh.northstar is strictly for add-on product workflows and content types.
        By design, the tool cannot be used to edit default Plone workflows.
        
        It provides all the functionality you need to manipulate workflows
        easily through the web, using an AJAX-powered interface and to generate the
        products of the content types and workflows you've created TTW.
        
        
        You can take a look at the new video demonstrating the workflow editor
        http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DO8RhPo9YNc
        
        
        Tested with
        -----------
        * Firefox
        * Google Chrome
        * Safari
        * Opera
        * IE8
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Just add `uwosh.northstar` to your buildout eggs sections and then
        install the "North* " product in the add/remove products control
        panel.
        
        In older versions of Plone, you might need to add
        plone.app.jquerytools to your zcml slug section of your buildout also.
        
        
        Workflow App Generation with PloneFormGen
        -----------------------------------------
        
        >>> eggs = 
        >>>   ...
        >>>   Products.PloneFormGen
        >>>   ZopeSkel
        >>>   Paste
        >>>   PasteScript
        
        
        Workflow App Generation with Dexterity
        ---------------------------------------
        
        >>> eggs = 
        >>>   ...
        >>>   plone.app.dexterity
        >>>   ZopeSkel
        >>>   zopeskel.dexterity
        >>>   Paste
        
        
        Graphing
        --------
        
        One feature of North* is that it can create a Diagram of the workflows 
        you create TTW. 
        
        The inspiration for this piece was pretty much taken from DCWorkflowGraph.
        
        In order to enable this feature, you'll need to install the Graphviz library.
        Information can be found at http://www.graphviz.org
        
        Once you've built Graphviz and have installed it, make sure the "dot"
        executable it creates is in your PATH, e.g.
        
        export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin
        
        assuming "make install" placed the Graphviz executables into
        /usr/local/bin. You can test that your PATH is set correctly if "which
        dot" finds the "dot" executable.
        
        Then restart your Zope or ZEO client. The next time you are looking at
        a custom workflow in Workflow Manager, you should see a new "Diagram"
        button. When you click on it, it generates a GIF depicting the
        workflow's states and transitions.
        
        
        Windows Compatibility
        ---------------------
        
        We have encountered a problem on Windows in which the Workflow App
        Generator creates a tar file but it doesn't contain everything
        expected.  We suspect either a Python or paster problem.
        
        
        
        Produced by Secret Laboratory Number 1 at UW Oshkosh.

        -------------------
        
        * Sanity check now takes initial state into account and checks if transition
          is used by state, not just if it has a new_state_id. Also, it now checks
          for an initial state being set.
          [vangheem]
        
        * added go to state/transition links for the definitions of the states and
          transitions so it is much easier to go to and from transitions that are
          connected to states and visa versa.
          [vangheem]
          
        * when adding a state from a transitions or a transition from a state, it'll
          automatically set the related values respectively since it'll assume you
          want to activate it for that item.
          [vangheem]
          
        * unsaved info text doesn't show up after adding a mail action anymore.
