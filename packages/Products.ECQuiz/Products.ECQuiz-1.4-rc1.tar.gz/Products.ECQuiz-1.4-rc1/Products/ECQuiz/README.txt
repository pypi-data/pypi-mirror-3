Installing with buildout
------------------------

If you are using `buildout`_ to manage your instance you can install 
ECQuiz by adding it to the eggs line for your instance::

  [instance]
  eggs =
      ... 
      Products.ECQuiz

After updating the configuration you need to run ``bin/buildout``, 
which will take care of updating your system.

Then restart your zope instance and use the Add/Remove products page
in Site Setup to install ECQuiz.

.. _buildout: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zc.buildout


Installing without buildout
---------------------------

Move (or symlink) the ``ECQuiz`` folder of this project
(``Products.ECQuiz/Products/ECQuiz``) into the ``Products`` directory 
of the Zope instance it has to be installed for, and restart the 
server.  Use the Add/Remove products page in Site Setup to install 
ECQuiz.
