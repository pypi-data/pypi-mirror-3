ownpaste
========

ownpaste is a pastebin web application, designed to be used as a
personal/private pastebin.

This project is motivated by the difficulty of maintain a public pastebin
service nowadays, without time expiration and heavy spam filters. This is
the reason why services like http://paste.pocoo.org/ are shutting down.

A simple private pastebin application, that you can run by yourself, that
provides a nice RESTful API, allowing the creation of cool clients, and that
can highlight your files nicely, without the risk of get offline tomorrow
due to spam issues looks like a nice idea in this current scenario.

ownpaste uses the Flask_ web framework (and some of its extensions), the
Pygments_ syntax highlighter and a few other well-known Python_ libraries.

.. _Flask: http://flask.pocoo.org/
.. _Pygments: http://pygments.org/
.. _Python: http://www.python.org/
