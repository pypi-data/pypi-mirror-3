        ====
        
        Pyng is a collection of Python utility functions I've written over the years,
        and that I keep wishing were available everywhere. Sadly, in many cases I've
        simply pasted copies of individual functions as needed. But no more!
        
        It's organized as follows:
        
        * **exc:** manipulate exceptions, e.g. reraise, retry
        
        * **iters:** generic iterator functionality, akin to itertools
        
        * **genio:** generator-based file I/O, loosely related to Java file streams
        
        * **relwalk:** os.walk() filtered to produce pathnames relative to the
          starting directory
        
        * **replacefile:** filter a text file in-place
        
        Please see the individual docstrings for more information.
