Quick Installation
------------------

Installing Pyflation is as simple as typing

$ python setup.py install

inside the directory where this file is located.

Requirements
------------
Pyflation has the following requirements:

Python 2.6 or higher (tested with 2.6.4) - http://www.python.org
Numpy (tested with 1.3.0) - http://www.numpy.org
Scipy (tested with 0.7.1) - http://www.scipy.org
Cython (tested with 0.12.1) - http://www.cython.org
PyTables 2.2 or higher (tested with 2.2) - http://www.pytables.org

The pyflation.cosmographs module contains helper functions to use 
with the Matplotlib package (http://matplotlib.sf.net) but this is not a
requirement of the core modules. 

Basic Installation
------------------
 
First unpack the pyflation-x.x.x.tar.gz file in a suitable location. From the 
command line this can be done by using

$ tar xzvf pyflation-x.x.x.tar.gz

Then enter the created directory using

$ cd pyflation-x.x.x

The setup.py script will install pyflation in your local python installation. 
If you want to change the location of the installation list the possible options
using

$ python setup.py install --help

The most important option is --prefix which will change the base directory used
in deciding where to store the installation. The default depends on your 
installation and local python executable but is often /usr. For example if you 
want everything installed under the directory /home/me/localinstall/ then use

$ python setup.py install --prefix=/home/me/localinstall/

If you do not have the appropriate permissions you may not be able to install
to a system directory. In this case using the prefix option with a directory
you can write to is the best option.

Alternatively the virtualenv python module provides a useful way of keeping
python libraries in separate installations. This is useful if you work with
more than one version of a particular library and want to be able to run them
side by side. See http://virtualenv.openplans.org/ for more information.

Developer Installation
----------------------

If you do not want to install Pyflation into your system or local python 
site-packages directory, then it is possible to use it from within a separate
directory structure. Use the --copy-code flag and the --codedir option of 
pyflation-newrun.py to specify where the code directory is (possibly the current 
directory).
Execution of the other scripts should be done from within the new run directory,
i.e. where run_config.py resides, or the run directory should be added to the
PYTHONPATH environment variable. 

It is also possible to use the Bazaar version control system to keep track of
changes made and propogate them to newly created runs. This method requires bzr 
to be available. In the unpacked directory run

$ bzr init
$ bzr add
$ bzr commit -m "New Install"

to initialise a Bazaar branch with the current directory as its contents.
To start a new run with the code copied into the run directory use the 
bin/pyflation-newrun.py script with the --copy-code and --codedir options and 
the --bzr flag to specify use of Bazaar.
