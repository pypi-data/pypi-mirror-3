Django Image Helper

Provides a model mixin that has 'image' and 'thumbnail' fields.
The uploaded image will be scaled to the model's 'IMAGE_SIZE' and
a thumbnail will be scaled and saved to the model's 'THUMBNAIL_SIZE'.

Additionally, there is an admin mixin to help you display an image's thumbnail
when in the admin's listview.
