        Usage
        =====
        
        To use with pelican or another docutils-based system, add the following to 
        your pelican configuration file::
        
            import rstyoutube
            rstyoutube.setup_docutils()
            
        To use rstyoutube in standalone rst files, you can use the included
        ``rst2html+youtube.py`` script, which should get installed onto your PATH.
        
        In your reST document, include a youtube directive with the video's id as 
        the sole argument as follows::
        
            This is my document
        
            .. youtube:: 5blbv4WFriM
        
            Hope you enjoyed the video.
        
        That's all it takes.  
        
        Options
        =======
        
        If you want more fine-grained control, you can add various options::
        
            .. youtube:: 5blbv4WFriM
                :start: 67
                :width: 640
                :height: 480
                :ssl:
                :hd:
        
        start
        -----
        
        The number of seconds into the video where you want to start playback.
        
        width
        -----
        
        height
        ------
        
        The size of the embedded viewer.  Defaults to 640x480, or if the ``hd`` 
        option is set, defaults to 1080x720.
        
        ssl
        ---
        
        This option takes no arguments.  If it is present, the player is embedded
        over https, rather than http.
        
        hd
        --
        
        This option takes no arguments.  If it is present, the embedded video is
        shown in HD.  The player's default size becomes 1080x720, but can still
        be overridden using the ``width`` and ``height`` options.
