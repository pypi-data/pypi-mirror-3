Available settings
==================

Here are listed, divided roughly by semantic group, all the settings that can
be found in the ``plone_registry`` that are related to deco.

Some of them will be in the form ``setting.dotted.name.$variable.whatever`` to
denote that there is a variable part.

Widget actions
--------------

``plone.app.deco.default_widget_actions``
    A list of actions that should be applied to the field tiles if no specific
    configuration is present

``plone.app.deco.widget_actions.$widget_name``
    With ``$widget_name`` being the full dotted name of a widget or widget
    factory (with dots replaces by underscores), holds a
    ``plone.app.deco.interfaces.IWidgetAction`` object that has two fields:
    ``name`` is the dotted name of the widget or factory, and ``actions`` is a
    list of actions to be added to the tile whose field has the widget
    specified by the dotted name.
    Especially useful in case of rich text widgets or widgets that have a
    corresponding inline Deco widget.  It is for now required to put both the
    factory (``*FieldWidget``) and the widget itself (``*Widget``) in the
    configuration as two separate entries holding the same values.

Omitted fields
--------------

``plone.app.deco.default_omitted_fields``
    A list containing the full dotted names of the fields that are not to be
    displayed: for example
    ``plone.app.dexterity.behaviors.metadata.IPublication.effective``

``plone.app.deco.omitted_fields.$portal_type``
    With ``$portal_type`` being a portal type name (such as ``plone.page``)
    with the dots replaces by underscores (hence resulting in
    ``plone.app.deco.omitted_fields.plone_page``), contains a list of the
    full dotted names of the fields that are not to be displayed for the type
    in question. Note that it overrides totally the ``default_omitted_fields``,
    in order to make it usable to show fields omitted by default.
