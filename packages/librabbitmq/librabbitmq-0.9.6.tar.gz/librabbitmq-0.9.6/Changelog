0.9.6
=====
:release-date: 2012-06-13 11:25 P.M BST

* Fixes problem with basic_publish and kombu.

0.9.5
=====
:release-date: 2012-06-07 12:20 P.M BST

* Now supports 'arguments' for:

    - basic_consume
    - exchange_declare
    - queue_declare
    - queue_bind
    - queue_unbind

* Release buffers after every command, so that memory
  does not grow on operations like ``basic_cancel``.

* Now uses buffer instead of PyString_Join.

* basic_consume now returns consumer tag.

* Now compiles with -Wall -ansi -pedantic.

* The message callback is now called from the C stack,
  so that drain_events does not return control back to the Python interpreter.

  Calling the callback from the same stack as slurping the socket enables
  us to pass the memory directly to the callback as a buffer object.

* When receiving messages we now only allocate memory once for single frame
  payloads.

    For multiple frames we no longer create temporary PyString's,
    but instead just memcpy the contents to a single string buffer.

* Adds amqp methods:

    - basic_cancel
    - flow
    - recover

* Now using array.array to keep track of unused channel id's.

* Internally the C Connection object now consistently have the channel
  as the first argument for all channel related methods.

* Fixed compiler warning in basic.qos

* frame_max, channel_max and heartbeat values are now updated
  to the values received from connection_tune_ok.

* basic_recv now raises socket.timeout directly, so that don't
  have to reraise.

* Unicode support.
