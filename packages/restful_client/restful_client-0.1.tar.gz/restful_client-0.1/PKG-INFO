Description: ==============
        restful_client
        ==============
        
        restful_client is an asychronous library that assists in writing clients for
        RESTful services. 
        
            A RESTClient is an extension of a urllib2.Request class that also contains its own HTTP opener
            so the request can be executed and results passed through an (optional) call back mechanism.
            
            The default_callback function in __init__ demonstrates the protocol that should be supported by
            the callback function.
            
            See http://docs.python.org/library/urllib2.html#request-objects for urllib2 Request documentation
            and http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/articles/urllib2.shtml
            and http://www.doughellmann.com/PyMOTW/urllib2/ for useful usage notes.
            
            TODO: Add support for timeouts at per client instance level (via opener).
            TODO: May need to implement smart exception handling. When YOU start encountering reproducable
                        HTTP exceptions (or others) please contact Ben so he can see what exception handling strategy
                        would work best for this library.
