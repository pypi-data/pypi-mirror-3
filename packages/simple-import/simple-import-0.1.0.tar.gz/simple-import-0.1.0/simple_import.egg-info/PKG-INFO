Description: Python's missing import functions
        
        Implements import_item() and from_x_import_y() functions.
        
        Both take strings specifying what you want to import, and return
        the actual item. Yes, they're brief, but I find myself needing them
        enought that I packaged them up. Why aren't they in Python core? Who knows!
