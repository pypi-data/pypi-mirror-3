Thanks for downloading FMS.

Requirements
============

- A working installation of the Python language (http://www.python.org), version
  should be 2.4 or greater.
- The PyYaml library (http://pyyaml.org/) is necessary to read configuration
  files.

Installing FMS
==============

The preferred way to install FMS is to use the pip_ installer::

	$ pip install fms

It should install it, and any required dependancies (that is, PyYaml at the
moment). You may consider installing in a Virtual environment.

.. _Virtual environment: http://guide.python-distribute.org/virtualenv.html
.. _pip: http://guide.python-distribute.org/installation.html#pip-info

If you downloaded a source pakage and want to install it, make sure you have
Python 2.4 or greater installed. Then run this command (as root) from a command
prompt:

    $ python setup.py install


As an alternative, you may just copy or link the fms directory in your
Python's installation site-packages directory.

In addition, you may move the 'fms.py' script somewhere on your path.

See the docs/ directory for more detailed installation steps, especially if you
intend to run FMS on Windows.

To check that anything went well, cd to the tests directory and run:

	python runalltests.py

Uninstalling FMS
================

If you installed FMS with pip_, then simply::

	$ pip uninstall fms

If you installed FMS from source, cd to your Python's installation
site-packages directory, and remove fms directory and egg-info file :

	rm -r fms*

Then remove the fms.py script from where it was installed, probably /usr/bin 
or /usr/local/bin on Unix. 

You're done. Thanks for giving FMS a try !
