Description: django-s3-folder-storage
        ========================
        
        Quick extension of django-storages' S3BotoStorage to allow separate folders for uploaded and static media within an S3 bucket.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Use `pip` to install from PyPI:
        
        	pip install django-s3-folder-storage
        
        Add `s3_folder_storage` to your settings.py file:
        
        	INSTALLED_APPS = (
        	    ...
        	    's3_folder_storage',
        	    ...
        	)
        
        Configuration
        -------------
        
        You are essentially using `django-storages` for S3 hosting, so you will be using their settings. The two settings that are specific to `django-s3-folder-storage` are `DEFAULT_S3_PATH` and `STATIC_S3_PATH`.
        
        Here's an example:
        
        	DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 's3_folder_storage.s3.DefaultStorage'
        	DEFAULT_S3_PATH = "media"
        	STATICFILES_STORAGE = 's3_folder_storage.s3.StaticStorage'
        	STATIC_S3_PATH = "static"
        	AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = {{ your key id here }}
        	AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = {{ your secret key here }}
        	AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME = {{ your bucket name here }}
        	
        	MEDIA_ROOT = '/%s/' % DEFAULT_S3_PATH
        	MEDIA_URL = '//s3.amazonaws.com/%s/media/' % AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME
        	STATIC_ROOT = "/%s/" % STATIC_S3_PATH
        	STATIC_URL = '//s3.amazonaws.com/%s/static/' % AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME
        	ADMIN_MEDIA_PREFIX = STATIC_URL + 'admin/'
