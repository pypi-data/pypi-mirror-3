         Detailed Documentation
        ========================
        Motivation
        ==========
        
        `Rope <http://rope.sourceforge.net/>`_ is a great tool for python development.
        
        It is a `refactoring library <http://rope.sourceforge.net/overview.html>`_
        with the marvelous side effect of letting you navigate throughout code.
        
        You can use it with either `emacs <http://rope.sourceforge.net/ropemacs.html>`_
        of `vim <http://rope.sourceforge.net/ropevim.html>`_
        
        This recipe
        ===========
        
        This `zc.buildout <http://www.buildout.org/>`_ recipe makes a
        `.ropeproject folder <http://rope.sourceforge.net/overview.html#ropeproject-folder>`_
        with search paths pointing to the eggs of your choice... and their transitive dependencies!
        
        Benefits
        ~~~~~~~~
        
        1. Make rope both faster and more precise. [#]_
        
           The reason is that search paths are set **explicitly**,
           so rope does't have to guess through directory hierarchies.
        
        2. A very good complement to the `omelette recipe <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/collective.recipe.omelette>`_.
           Actually, code navigation is way easier that grepping. Give it a try.

        Usage
        ~~~~~
        
        In your buildout.cfg include the recipe, with the eggs property set to one or more eggs::
        
            [buildout]
            ...
            parts = ... ropeproject
        
            [ropeproject]
            recipe = collective.recipe.ropeproject
            eggs = ${anything_you_want}
