================

markdown2Mathjax (https://github.com/constantAmateur/markdown2Mathjax) is a simple package that allows you to use latex style math generated by MathJax (http://mathjax.org) in conjunction with the popular markdown format.  There are two implementations of markdown in python, this package is designed to be used with the more widely used and actively maintained of the two, called markdown2 (https://github.com/trentm/python-markdown2).  Typical usage is as follows::
    #!/usr/bin/env python
    
    from markdown2Mathjax import sanitizeInput, reconstructMath
    from markdown2 import markdown

    tmp = sanitizeInput(sometxt)
    markdedDownText = markdown(tmp[0])
    finalOutput = reconstructMath(markedDownText,tmp[1])

(where "sometxt" is a string containing the markdown+mathjax text.)

Usage
=====

By default, math is marked by single $ signs for inline math and double $$ signs for equations.  However, any delimiting strings may be used by changing the keyword arguments to the sanitizeInput and reconstructMath functions.  Note that by default mathjax does NOT use single dollars signs to delimit inline math, so if you use the defaults for this package, you will have to instruct mathjax to treat it appropriately.
