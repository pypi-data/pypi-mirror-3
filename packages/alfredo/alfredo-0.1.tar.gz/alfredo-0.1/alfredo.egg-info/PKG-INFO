Description: Alfredo - Born to serve!
        ************************
        
        
        Alfredo is a simple, extensible gtalk bot. It's cabaple of doing any kind of tasks, implemented as separated commands.
        
        Here is a typical session: ::
        
            you: inv some text
            alfredo: called inv some text -> txet emos
            
        
        Implementing a new command
        **************************
        
        Commands are implemented as Plugins (more at plugnplay <https://github.com/daltonmatos/plugnplay>). Just create a new class:
        
            from alfredo import Plugin, ICommand
        
            class SomeCommand(Plugin):
              implements = [ICommand]
        
              def help(self):
                return ('short help', 'long help')
        
              def name(self):
                return 'mycommand'
        
              def match_name(self, command):
                return 'mycommand' == command
        
              def run(self, user, *args)
                # process some logic
                return result
        
        
        In this case we create a new command named 'mycommand'. If we send this message to alfredo:
        
           mycommand p1 p2 p3
        
        
        the ``run()`` method would be called like this: ``run('user@domain.com', 'p1', 'p2', 'p3')``. This method must return a string, that will be sent back to the original user.
        
        
        How to use it
        *************
        
        To start talking to alfredo just add ``alfredo@daltonmatos.com`` to your gtalk conacts list and you are done!
