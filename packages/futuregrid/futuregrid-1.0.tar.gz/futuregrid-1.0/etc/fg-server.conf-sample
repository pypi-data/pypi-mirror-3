# LDAP authentication configuration
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  This define the LDAP information needed by the auth module
#
#  LDAPHOST: ldap server
#
#  LDAPUSER: dn that identified the user that will connect with ldap
#
#  LDAPPASS: password of the previous user for access to ldap server
#
#  log: file where logs are stored. You should include
#  the full path, otherwise it will use the current directory or $HOME.
#
#  test=it does not contanct ldap server when True. False if not provided.

# Image Repository Server configuration
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  port: is the port where this server (IRServer.py) will be listening
#
#  proc_max: number of request that can be processed at the same time
#
#  refresh: interval to check the status of the running requests when proc_max
#  is reached. If some request has the completed status, and a new request can 
#  be processed.
#
#  authorizedusers: list of users (separated by commas) that can use the repo 
#  using the name of other user as first argument. This is useful for other FG
#  tools that need to call the repository in behalf of an user. This also 
#  prevents that other users can hack the client to use the repository as if 
#  they were other users. (Optional)
#
#  nopasswdusers: Users listed here does need to introduce their passwd. Each
#  user will be attached to one or several IP address. The format is
#  userid:ip,ip1;userid1:ip2,ip3  (Optional)
#
#  backend: Specify the desired storage backend. Possible values are: mongodb
#  mysql, swiftmysql, swiftmongo, cumulusmysql, cumulusmongo. You need to have
#  the selected backend section configured below
#
#  log: file where logs are stored. You should include
#  the full path, otherwise it will use the current directory or $HOME. 
#
#  log_level: debug level. It can be debug, error, info, warning  
#
#  ca_cert: authority that sign the certificate
#
#  certfile: x509 certificate used by the service
#
#  keyfile: key of the certificate
#
#  restConfFile: Configuration file for the Rest Interface. This is only needed
