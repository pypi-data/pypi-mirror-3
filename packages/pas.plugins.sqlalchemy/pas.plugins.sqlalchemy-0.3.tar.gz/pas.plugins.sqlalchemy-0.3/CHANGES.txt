Changelog
=========

0.3 (2011-10-13)
----------------

- Fire `IPropertiesUpdated` (from PAS) event on `setPropertiesForUser`
  to allow components to take action when user properties are updated.
  [malthe]

- Merged SVN repository (select branches) into the existing Github
  repository to consolidate improvements.
  [malthe]

- Add title and description to groups.

  GetRolesForPrincipal needs to listen to __ignore_group_roles__ and
  __ignore_direct_roles__ from the request to work with plone 4.
  GetRolesForPrincipal needs to take group roles into account as
  default.
  [sunew]

- Merged many changes from the branches: wichert-flexible,
  wichert-flexible-pw-encryption, zedr-mysql-optimized, auspex.

  Version 0.3 is not compatible with the earlier versions, upgrading
  will require some migration (not included).

- Seperate user_id and login - as in PAS. (Not complete?)
  [wichert]

  of functionality between groups and users.

  [auspex, wichert, sunew, zedr]

0.2.1 (unreleased)
------------------------

- Fixed some tests. Now tests passes on plone 4.0.7.
  [sunew]

- Convert to and from UTF-8 and unicode. Plone uses UTF-8 internally
  and most Python deployments will coerce using the 'ascii' codec,
  resulting in unicode decode errors. [mborch]

0.2 (released 2009/7/17)
------------------------

- Changed the 'listed' and 'ext_editor' column type to 'Integer' match
  the Plone model. [seletz]
