        ==========================
        
        Note to the author: Please add something informative to this README *before*
        releasing your software, as `a little documentation goes a long way`_.  Both
        README.rst (this file) and NEWS.txt (release notes) will be included in your
        package metadata which gets displayed in the PyPI page for your project.
        
        You can take a look at the README.txt of other projects, such as repoze.bfg
        (http://bfg.repoze.org/trac/browser/trunk/README.txt) for some ideas.
