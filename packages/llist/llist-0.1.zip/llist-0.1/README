llist - linked lists for Python
===============================

llist is an extension module for Python providing basic linked list
data structures.
Collections implemented in the llist module perform well in problems
which rely on fast insertions and/or deletions of elements in
the middle of a sequence.
For this kind of workload, they can be significantly faster than
collections.deque or standard Python lists.

Note that Python 3.x is not supported.

Currently llist provides the following types of linked lists:
 - dllist - a doubly linked list
 - sllist - a singly linked list

Full documentation of these classes is available at:
http://packages.python.org/llist/

To install this package, either run "pip install llist",
or download it manually from http://pypi.python.org/pypi
then unpack the sources and compile them with "python setup.py install".
