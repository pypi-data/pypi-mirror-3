Description: =============================
        Django Hit Count Mixed Object

        Motivation
        ==========
        
        Imagine that you have ordered items, and each one can be customized with diferent toppings.
        Example:
        
          * Round Pizza with toppings (Spinach, Hot Sopresatta)
          * Round Pizza with toppings (Anchovies, Fried Eggplant)
        
        So you want to know, the number of items ordered with the same toppings.
        
        Application provides the following methods
        ==========================================
        
        * push_hit
        
            ``object:`` model instance
        
            ``related_objects:`` sequence of model instances that compound  the mixed object together the object param
        
            ``hit_count:`` number of hits to push
        
        * get_hit_count
        
            ``object:`` model instance
        
            ``related_objects:`` sequence of model instances that compound  the mixed object together the object param
        
        
        * get_mixed_objects
        
        
              ``filters:`` dictionary of filter to quering mixed objects
        
              ``limit:`` max number of mixed objects to return
        
              ``offset:`` skip to this position before returning the results
        
              ``order_by:`` order the mixed objects by these keys
