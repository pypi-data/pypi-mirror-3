pyabm - an agent-based modeling toolkit for Python 2.7.x.
 
Description
_______________________________________________________________________________

'pyabm' is an agent-based modeling toolkit written to simplify coding and 
running agent-based models int he Python programming language. pyabm 
includes tools to output model results (as text files, plots or ESRI 
shapefiles), and has a parameter handling system to ease the process of 
model testing and validation, and of running multiple scenarios with 
varying model parameters.

The model was constructed by Alex Zvoleff as part of his dissertation 
research at San Diego State University (SDSU) in the Department of 
Geography. Contact Alex Zvoleff or Prof. Li An at SDSU with any questions.
