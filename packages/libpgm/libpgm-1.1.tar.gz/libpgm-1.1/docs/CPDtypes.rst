CPDtypes
********

There are currently three real types of CPD nodes in this directory, but there could be infinitely many more. The *crazy* type listed last is meant to show that classes can exist for any computational way to sample a node based on its parent values. The flexibility provided allows for random sampling to exist in hybrid networks.
