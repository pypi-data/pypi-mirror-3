Description: overlay4u - Tools for dealing with overlayfs in ubuntu (Work in Progress)
        =========================================================================
        
        Simple way to create an overlayfs in ubuntu within Python.
        
        Warnings!
        ---------
        
        overlay4u requires root. Be sure you're aware of that. It's still very much a
        work in progress so please use with caution and hopefully on VM that you do not
        care about.
        
        Caveats
        -------
        
        overlay4u is not currently being designed for anything but Ubuntu 12.04. At
        this time that's the first priority.
        
        Currently Working
        -----------------
        
        - Mounting works! (Tested and works)
        - Creating a table of mounted filesystems
        - Unmounting
        
        Possible interface examples
        ---------------------------
        
        Create an overlay at dest::
            
            import overlay4u
        
            overlay = overlay4u.mount('dest', 'lower', 'upper')
        
            overlay.unmount()
        
        If the destination already has something mounted it won't mount again::
            
            import overlay4u
        
            overlay1 = overlay4u.mount('dest', 'lower', 'upper')
            
            # This will throw an error.
            overlay2 = overlay4u.mount('dest', 'lower', 'upper')
        
        That's all. It's a relatively simple tool.
