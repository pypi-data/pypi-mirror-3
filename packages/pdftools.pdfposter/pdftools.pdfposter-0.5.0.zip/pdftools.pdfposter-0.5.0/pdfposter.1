.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBpdfposter\fP <options> infile outfile


.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBPdfposter\fP can be used to create a large poster by building it from
multple pages and/or printing it on large media. It expects as input a
PDF file, normally printing on a single page. The output is again a
PDF file, maybe containing multiple pages together building the
poster.
The input page will be scaled to obtain the desired size.


.\" comment
.\" The output pages bear cutmarks and have slightly overlapping
.\" images for easier assembling.
The program uses a simple but efficient method which is possible with
PDF: All new pages share the same data stream of the scaled page. Thus
resulting file grows moderatly.

To control its operation, you need to specify either the size of the
desired poster or a scale factor for the image:

.INDENT 0.0

.IP \(bu 2
Given the poster size, it calculates the required number of sheets
to print on, and from that a scale factor to fill these sheets
optimally with the input image.


.IP \(bu 2
Given a scale factor, it derives the required number of pages from
the input image size, and positions the scaled image centered on
this area.

.TP
.B \-\-version
Show program\'s version number and exit


.TP

Be verbose. Tell about scaling, rotation and number of
pages. Can be used more than once to increase the
verbosity.

.SS Defining Output
.INDENT 0.0

.TP
.BI \-m\  BOX ,\ \-\-media\-size\fn= BOX
Specify the desired media size to print on.
See below for \fIBOX\fP. The default is A4 in the standard
package.


.TP
.BI \-p\  BOX ,\ \-\-poster\-size\fn= BOX
Specify the poster size. See below for \fIBOX\fP.
pdfposter will autonomously choose scaling and rotation to
best fit the input onto the poster (see EXAMPLES below).

If you give neither the \fI\-s\fP nor the \fI\-p\fP option, the default
poster size is identical to the media size.


.TP
.BI \-s\  NUMBER
Specify a linear scaling factor to produce the poster.
Together with the input image size and optional margins,
this induces an output poster size. So don\'t specify both \fI\-s\fP
and \fI\-p\fP.

Default is deriving the scale factor to fit a given poster
size.

.SS Box Definition
The \fIBOX\fP mentioned above is a specification of horizontal and
vertical size. The syntax is as follows (with multipier being
specified optionally):

.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fIbox\fP = [ \fImultiplier\fP ] \fIunit\fP

\fImultiplier\fP = \fInumber\fP "x" \fInumber\fP

\fIunit\fP = \fImedianame\fP or \fIdistancename\fP

.\" Only in combination with the *-i* option, the program
.\" also understands the offset specification in the *BOX*.
.\"  <offset> = +<number>,<number>
.\"  [<offset>]
.\"  and offset
Many international media names are recognised by the program, in upper
and lower case, and can be shortened to their first few characters, as
long as unique. For instance \'A0\', \'Let\'. Distance names are like
\'cm\', \'inch\', \'ft\'.

Medias are typically not quadratic but rectangular, which means width
and hight differ. Thus using medianames is a bit tricky:

.INDENT 0.0

.TP
.B 10x20cm
obviuos: 10 cm x 20 cm (portrait)


.TP
.B 20x10cm
same as 10x20cm, since all boxes are rotated to portrait
format

.UNINDENT
Now when using medianames it gets tricky:

.INDENT 0.0

.TP
.B 1x1a4
same as approx. 21x29cm (21 cm x 29 cm, portrait)


.TP
.B 1x2a4
same as approx. 21x58cm (21 cm x 58 cm, portrait)

This are two a4 pages put together at the \fIsmall\fP side: One
portrait page wide and two portrait pages high.


.TP
.B 2x1a4
same as approx. 42x29cm, which is rotated to portrait and is
the same a 29x42cm (29 cm x 42 cm)

This are two a4 pages put together at the \fIlong\fP side: Two
portrait pages wide and one portrait page high.

.SH EXAMPLES
.INDENT 0.0

.TP
.B pdfposter \-mA3 \-pA0 a4.pdf out.pdf
Prints an A4 input file on 8 A3 pages, forming an A0 poster.


.TP
.B pdfposter \-p3x3Let a4.pdf out.pdf
Prints an inputfile on a poster of 3x3 Letter pages.

.TP
.B pdfposter \-mA0 input.pdf out.pdf
Enlarges an inputfile to print on a large\-media A0 capable
device.


.TP
.B pdfposter \-s4 input.pdf out.pdf
Enlarge an inputfile exactly 4 times, print on the default A4
media, and let \fBpdfposter\fP determine the number of pages
required.

.UNINDENT

.\" not yet implemented
.\" :pdfposter -mLegal -p1x1m -w10% -C5 input.pdf out.pdf:
.\"     Scale a postscript image to a poster of about 1 square meter,
.\"     printing on 'Legal' media, maintaining a 10% of 'Legal' size
.\"     as white margin around the poster. Print cutmark lines and grid
.\"     labels, but don't print cut mark arrow heads.
.INDENT 0.0

.TP
.B pdfposter \-m10x10cm \-pa0 a4.pdf out.pdf
Just to show how efficient \fBpdfposter\fP is: This will create a file
containing 192 pages, but only 15 times as big as the single page.
With a4.pdf being a quite empty page, this ratio should be even
better for filled pages.
