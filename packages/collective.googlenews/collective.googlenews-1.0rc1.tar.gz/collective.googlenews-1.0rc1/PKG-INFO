        Introduction
        ============
        
        `Google News`_ service has some technical requirements. This add-on solve the
        only issues Plone have regarding these constraints. Let's Plone be `Google
        News`_ ready.
        
        Technical requirements can be found at
        http://www.google.com/support/news_pub/bin/topic.py?hl=en&topic=11665
        
        Article URLs
        ============
        
        URL need to display a three-digit number. This add-on override the url
        normalizer to add a unique id.
        
        SiteMap
        =======
        
        This add-on add a @@googlenews-sitemap.xml view for topic content type. This
        view add some checks before loading items:
        
        * no more than 1000 items returned
        * items must have been published in the last two days
        * items are ordered on the effective date (reversed)
        
        So you don't need to add criteria for these, but types should be set to News
        Item to be sure you are publishing news.
        
        How to publish my website into Google News ?
        ============================================
        
        You need to have a topic instance in your website. By default in Plone
        /news/aggregator is the one. In the process you can provide the sitemap to
        help google to get the last news by providing the url
        example.com/news/aggregator/@@googlenews-sitemap.xml
        
        .. _`Google News`: https://news.google.com/

        To enable this product in a buildout-based installation:
        
        1. Edit your buildout.cfg and add ``collective.googlenews`` to the list of
           eggs to install ::
        
            [buildout]
            ...

                collective.googlenews
