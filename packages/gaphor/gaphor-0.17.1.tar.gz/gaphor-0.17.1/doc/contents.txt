  *The source is the documentation.*

Well, not for us.

Currently, there's not a lot of documentation though. For those of you interested in Gaphor there's

* A :doc:`manual <manual/index>`. It outlines some of the ideas in and behind Gaphor.
* The :ref:`tech-section` contains some interesting articles about the technology that drives Gaphor and Gaphas, Gaphor's canvas widget.

If you're into writing plug-ins for Gaphor you should have a look at our fabulous :url:`Hello world <http://github.com/amolenaar/gaphor.plugins.helloworld>` plug-in.
