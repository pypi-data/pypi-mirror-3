Description: ==================================
         Mockstar -- mock like a rockstar
        ==================================
        
        Mockstar is a lightweight library on top of
        `http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/mock/ <mock>`_ library that was
        written because I hate copypaste.
        
        If you are a honest man that tries to cover all his code with 100% of
        tests, then you know that you will have tons and tons of tests. That's
        why it is important to reduce lines of code and repeating yourself
        when you write those.
