        Teaser/Banner content type for Plone
        
        This Plone add-on installs the content type teaser, which is meant to be used
        for small advertisements on a homepage to advertise own or external content.
        
        Randomly selected teasers will be shown in a Teaser portlet. An importance
        level controls the frequency, how often teasers are shown - a teaser with
        higher importance will be shown more frequently. If more teasers are shown in
        portlets on a page, one teaser isn't shown twice.
        
        If you need to show specific teasers only in specific portlets (e.g. to
        distinguish between horizontal and vertical teasers), use the importance levels
        or subject filter to assign teasers to those portlets.

        Changelog
        =========
        
        2.0b1 (unreleased)
        -------------------
        
        - Remove IPortletAvailable adapter, which was a overcomponentized
          proof-of-concept and too complicated to be used.
          [thet]
        
        - Remove alternative image field, which was meant to allow a portlet to select
          an Landscape/Portrait image from the same teaser. The meaning of the option
          was unclear. Instead, upload two different Teasers and select different
          importance levels for it.
          [rnix, thet]
        
        - Option to get Teasers via AJAX call. This makes the teaser portlet better
          cachable.
