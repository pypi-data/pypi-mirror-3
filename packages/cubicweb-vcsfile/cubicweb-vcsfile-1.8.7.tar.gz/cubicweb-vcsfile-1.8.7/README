Summary
-------

This cube stores the data found in a version content manager
repository. It currently works with subversion or mercurial repository.

This cube doesn't access to the data directly. It depends on the
logilab.devtools.vcslib library. All the repository's metadata (eg revision,
file names, commit message, date and autor, etc) are stored as entities, and
thus queryable via RQL, while actual files content is kept in the repository and
fetched from there on demand.
