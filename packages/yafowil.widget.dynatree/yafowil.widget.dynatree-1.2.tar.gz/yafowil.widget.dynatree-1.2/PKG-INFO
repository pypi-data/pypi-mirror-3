Description: This is a **tree widget** for `YAFOWIL
        <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/yafowil>`_ - Yet Another Form WIdget Library.
        
        The tree-widget for yafowil utilizes the jQuery plugin `jquery.dynatree.js
        <http://wwwendt.de/tech/dynatree/index.html>`_ (at
        `google-code <http://code.google.com/p/dynatree/>`_).
        
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        The dynatree widget takes the parameters:
        
        - source
        - selectMode
        - minExpandLevel
        - rootVisible
        - autoCollapse
        - checkbox'

        Example Application
        ===================
        
        To run the example application and tests coming with this package run
        `bootstrap <http://python-distribute.org/bootstrap.py>`_ (Python 2.6 or 2.7)
        with a buildout like so::
        
        [buildout]
        parts = gunicorn
        
        [tests]
        recipe = zc.recipe.testrunner
        eggs =
        yafowil.widget.dynatree[test]
        
        [gunicorn]
        recipe = zc.recipe.egg:scripts
        eggs =
        ${test:eggs}
        gunicorn
        
        Start the application with::
        
        ./bin/gunicorn yafowil.widget.dynatree.example:app
        
        and connect with your webbrowser to ``http://localhost:8000/``
