        *Message For You Sir!* (m4us) is a coroutine-based concurrent programming
        library and framework for Python_.  It is heavily inspired by the `BBC
        Research`_'s brilliant Kamaelia_ project.  In fact, it largely intends to be a
        reimplementation of most of Kamaelia_'s core concepts, but be based on Python_
        coroutines instead of generators.  It also aims to be cleaner and simpler.
        
        .. features
        
        Features
        ========
        
        * Provides coroutine-based inbox/outbox message-passing programming style.
        * Provides simple event loop and message routing mechanisms.
        * Provides single-thread and thread-based concurrency.
        * Promotes loose-coupling and component-based program design.
        * Excellent for pipeline-style data transformation systems.
        * Supports publish/subscribe style message distribution.
        * Works with both plain Python_ 2.6+ coroutines (``value = (yield)``) and
          class-based components.
        * Much more pythonic than Kamaelia_ and with less magic.
        * Clearly defined interfaces for all objects.
        * Complete API documentation and very clean source code.
        * Extensible with custom schedulers, post offices, message filters, etc.
        * Extensible with zope.interface_ adapters and custom interface
          implementations.
        * Easy to extend to support distributed computing.
        * 100% line test coverage and almost 100% branch test coverage.
        * Currently implements equivalents to Kamaelia_'s *Component*,
          *ThreadedComponent*, *Scheduler*, *Pipeline*, *Graphline*, and *Backplane*.
        * Provides several convenience functions and decorators to make creating
          common coroutine types easy.

        Status
        ======
        
        This project is very young and the code should be considered *Alpha* quality.
        It has been minimally tested on Linux and Windows, under Python_ 2.6, but has
        not yet been seriously tested on any platform.  That said, it does have an
        extensive test suite with almost 100% branch test coverage.
        
        You are welcome to use this project if you like it, and contributions are
        certainly welcome, but if you are looking for a better supported project with a
        strong community, then Kamaelia_ is a the more responsible choice.
        
        .. installation
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        The easiest way to install this distribution is::
        
          pip install m4us
        
        or::
        
          easy_install m4us
        
        .. WARNING:: If you use setuptools_, distribute_ will be installed
           automatically, replacing your setuptools.  If this is unacceptable, using
           virtualenv_ to isolate the installation is recommended.

        Basic Usage
        ===========
        
        Documentation is still lacking.  For now see `A Simple Example`_
        |(in docs/example.py)| for a simple example.
        
        See also the integration tests for additional examples.
