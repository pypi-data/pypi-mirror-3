        <p>A while back, I published a post about my setup, inspired by the awesome
articles on the <a class="reference external" href="http://usesthis.com/">UsesThis</a> site.</p>
<p>As times change, so does my toolset. So, here's a list of my latest
favorite things. I <em>love</em> them, and think you should use them too.</p>
<div class="section" id="ep-io">
<h2>ep.io</h2>
<p>Perfectly Pythonic WSGI Hosting.</p>
<p>There are a number of new Heroku-like Python hosts out there, but most
of them leave a bad taste in my mouth. This is mostly because they only
support Django, and not generic WSGI (e.g. Flask apps).</p>
<p>Ep.io supports any WSGI application. It charges based on usage and
offers a generous amount of free usage <em>per application</em>. Redis support.
Cron jobs. Optional git/mercurial integration. The architecture and
configurations are <em>very</em> elegant. I love it.</p>
<p>I host a most of my open source applications, including this very
website, on ep.io. I couldn't be happier.</p>

<h2>gaug.es</h2>
<p>Google Analytics is an extremely power analytics platform that can be
used to drive important business decisions and analyze deep trends.</p>
<p>I don't need any of that.</p>
<p>I need realtime traffic information, visitor browsers and devices, and a
simple list of referral URLs.</p>
<p>Check out <a class="reference external" href="http://gaug.es">Gauges</a>. Realtime, simple, and elegant
analytics. No domain limits. It's provided by a group of great guys that
are passionate about making the service as awesome as possible. It
really shows.</p>
<p>[ <a class="reference external" href="http://gaug.es">gaug.es</a> ]</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="dnsimple">
<h2>DNSimple</h2>
<p>Stop using GoDaddy. Now. They have extremely misleading billing
practices, terrible ads, and — worst of all — one of the worst DNS
management interfaces on earth.</p>
<p>DNSimple has the simplest and most elegant DNS management system I've
ever used. Everything just works —&nbsp;instantly. One-click record templates
for GitHub Pages, Google Apps, etc.</p>
<p>There's a small subscription fee, tiered by the number of hosted
domains. If you find yourself thinking, &quot;Why would I pay for DNS
hosting?&quot;: You get what you pay for.</p>
<p>It doesn't matter where you register your domains, but I register all of
mine through DNSimple. The registration cost is a little high compared
to a few providers, but — again —&nbsp;you really get what you pay for.</p>
<p>I got a signed postcard from them in the mail last year, wishing me a
Happy New Year. These guys care.</p>

<div class="section" id="sublime-text-2">
<h2>Sublime Text 2</h2>
<p>It's time to face the facts: TextMate is dead. The author has been lying
to his loyal community for a long time now. It's time for us to move on.</p>
<p>I looked for a worthy replacement for a long time. This wasn't an easy
task. I believe that I have tried literally every editor ever released
for every major operating system within the past 10 years. I'm really
picky about my development environment; It's part of who I am.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.sublimetext.com/2">Sublime Text 2</a> is incredible.</p>
<p>It offers TextMate theme and snippets support, extremely optimized
workflows, and a full internal Python API for writing plugins. Coupled
with <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/lunixbochs/sublimelint">SublimeLint</a> and
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/buymeasoda/soda-theme">Soda Theme Dark</a>, it's
perfect.</p>
<p>It's available for OS X, Linux, and Windows too.</p>

<h2>Readability</h2>
<p>Full disclosure: <a class="reference external" href="http://kennethreitz.com/joining-arc90-readability.html">I work for
Readability</a>.
However, that's completely irrelevant. Readability is easily one of my
favorite tools ever.</p>
<p>If I land on an article that's either ugly or too long to read at the
moment, I hit ` in Chrome. I'm presented with a highly polished,
content-only version of the article with elegant typography.</p>
<p>Top notch browser plugins. First-class Typography. Offline HTML5 apps
for every device I own. A daily digest of my articles, sent to my Kindle
automatically? Yes, please.</p>

<h2>Canon 35mm f/1.4L</h2>
<p>One of the few things that gets me away from my machine is photography.
Check out <a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickriver.com/photos/kennethreitz/">my Flickr
stream</a>. It's very
much a hobby, but I quite enjoy it.</p>
<p>My lens kit has gone through quite a few iterations. It took me a while,
but I'm finally got rid of my last zoom lens, and have moved on to all
primes. Zooms seem to suck creativity out of me. Constraints are good.</p>
<p>My new favorite lens is the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Canon-35mm-1-4L-Angle-Cameras/dp/B00009R6WY">Canon EF 35mm
f/1.4L</a>.
I'm blown away by this thing. It's exactly what I've been looking for. I
can't believe it hasn't been updated since 1992.</p>
<p>I've noticed a bit of a fanastic subculture behind this lens since I got
it. If you ever take a look at the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickriver.com/photos/whitehouse/popular-interesting/">White House's Flickr
Stream</a>,
you'll see the excellent work of Pete Souza. He uses the 35L in almost
every indoor photo. Incredible.</p>
<p>Before, I typically shot with my moderately telephoto <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Canon-85mm-f1-2L-Lens-Cameras/dp/B000EW9Y4M">85mm
f/1.2L</a>
(my photon vaccuum). I still use it on certain occasions, but the 35L is
really bringing my photography to a new level.</p>

are an unstoppable duo.</p>

<p>I've never been a fan of shared hosting at all. These guys proved me
wrong.</p>
<p>They really know their stuff. Python is a true first-class citizen on
their boxes: 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 3.1, 3.2 are all available, with
most of the popular supporting libraries (PIL, etc), out of the box. One
click installers for WordPress and more with 100% perfect permissions
set. Nginx-fronted Apache, giving you the best of both worlds. A
standard account gets you user-level SSH access to the box. Awesome.</p>
<p>If I need to host a PHP or static app, they're my first stop.</p>
