        This package provides support to integrate the RealObjects Edit On Pro wysiwyg 
        editor into plone to coexist with FCKEditor and Kupu.
        
        You need to have a folder named "eopro" (the same that comes with your editor 
        distribution) in your site root which contains all the 
        necessary edit on pro files including the license. 
        Make sure that you enable proper caching for these files!
