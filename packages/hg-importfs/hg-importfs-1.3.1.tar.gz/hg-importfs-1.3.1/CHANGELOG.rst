- Symlinks are no longer dereferenced on Linux (but still dereferenced on
  Windows).
- If the path of a symlink on Linux contains backward slashes (i.e. the link
  was intended for Windows), the slashes are converted to forward slashes and
  the link is dereferenced.

- Added new option --exclude-path to exclude a path relative to SOURCE.
- Added new option --retain-empty-dirs to import empty directories.
- The update operation inside the repository is using the --clean option.
- The repository is purged before each update/commit because there can be files
  without write permissions and Mercurial fails to update them.
