Description: 
        pyabm is an agent-based modeling toolkit written to simplify coding and 
        running agent-based models in the Python programming language. pyabm 
        includes basic classes for creation of agents, has tools to output model 
        results (as text files, plots or ESRI shapefiles), has a parameter handling 
        system to ease the process of model testing and validation, and has 
        utilities to assist in running multiple scenarios with varying model 
        parameters.
        
        Construction of pyabm is supported as part of an ongoing National Science 
        Foundation Partnerships for International Research and Education (NSF PIRE) 
        project `(grant OISE 0729709) <http://pire.psc.isr.umich.edu>`_
        Development of pyabm is ongoing, and the documentation is still a work in 
        progress.
