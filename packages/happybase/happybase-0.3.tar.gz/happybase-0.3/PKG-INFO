        -------------
        
        Release date: 2012-05-25
        
        New features:
        
        * Improved compatibility with HBase 0.90.x
        
          * In earlier versions, using :py:meth:`Table.scan` in combination with HBase
            0.90.x often resulted in crashes, caused by incompatibilities the
            underlying Thrift protocol.
          * A new `compat` flag to the :py:class:`Connection` constructor has been
            added to enable compatibility with HBase 0.90.x.
          * Note that the :py:meth:`Table.scan` API has a few limitations when used
            with HBase 0.90.x.
        
        * The `row_prefix` argument to :py:meth:`Table.scan` can now be used together
          with `filter` and `timestamp` arguments.
        
        Other changes:
        
        * Lower Thrift dependency to 0.6
        * The `setup.py` script no longer installs the tests
        * Documentation improvements
