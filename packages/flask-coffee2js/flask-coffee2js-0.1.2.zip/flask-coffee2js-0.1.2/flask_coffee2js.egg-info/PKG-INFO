        flask-coffee2js
        ===============
        
        A small Flask extension that makes it easy to use CoffeeScript with your Flask application.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        You can activate it by calling the ``coffee2js`` function with your Flask app as a parameter:
        
              from flaskext.coffee2js import coffee2js
              coffee2js(app, js_folder='js', coffee_folder='src/coffee')
        
        This will intercept the request to ``js_folder`` and compile de file if is necesary using the files from ``coffee_folder``.
        
        When you deploy your app you might not want to accept the overhead of checking the modification time of your ``.coffee`` and ``.jss`` files on each request. A simple way to avoid this is wrapping the coffee2js call in an if statement:
        
              if app.debug:
                  from flaskext.coffee2js import coffee2js
                  coffee2js(app)
                  
        If you do this you'll be responsible for rendering the ``.coffee`` files into ``.js`` when you deploy in non-debug mode to your production server.
