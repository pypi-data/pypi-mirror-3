Reportlabs package: http://www.reportlab.com/software/opensource/rl-toolkit/download/

If you get an exception "RenderPMError: Can't setFont(Times-Roman)
missing the T1 files?" (like I got) on d.save in above code - Solution
is to download and extract http://www.reportlab.com/ftp/fonts/pfbfer.zip
in reportlabs/fonts directory
