Description: ===========
        SMTP Tester
        ===========
        
        I spent a long time searching for a tool that would help me troubleshoot SMTP
        problems quickly and easily without having to resort to telnet. Finally, I gave
        up and wrote my own.
        
        Features
        --------
        
        - Tested on OSX, Linux, and Windows
        - Graphical (no more telnet)
        - Trace window showing live progress from DNS record look-ups through SMTP
          session
        - Ability to override all DNS and SMTP settings
        - Support for SASL and TLS
        
        Screenshots

        Installation
        ------------
        
        Install `wxPython <http://wxpython.org/download.php>`_ (version 2.9)
        
        ::
        
          # pip install smtptester
        
        ...or:
        
        ::
        
          # easy_install smtptester
        
        This should add an **smtptester** executable to your **$PATH**.
