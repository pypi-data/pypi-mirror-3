        About
        -----
        
        `billiard` is a fork of the Python 2.7 `multiprocessing <http://docs.python.org/library/multiprocessing.html>`_
        package. The multiprocessing package itself is a renamed and updated version of
        R Oudkerk's `pyprocessing <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/processing/>`_ package.
        This standalone variant is intended to be compatible with Python 2.4 and 2.5,
        and will draw it's fixes/improvements from python-trunk.
        
        - This package would not be possible if not for the contributions of not only
        the current maintainers but all of the contributors to the original pyprocessing
        package listed `here <http://pyprocessing.berlios.de/doc/THANKS.html>`_
        
        - Also it is a fork of the multiprocessin backport package by Christian Heims.
        
        - It includes the no-execv patch contributed by sbt.
        
        - And the Pool improvements previously located in `Celery`_.
