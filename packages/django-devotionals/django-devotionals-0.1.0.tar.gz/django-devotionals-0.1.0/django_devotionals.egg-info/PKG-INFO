Description: Django devotionals
        ================== 
        
        A demo application created as part of the 5Q programming challenge. The app handles the input and display of daily devotionals, including a django management command to import a csv file loaded with devotionals.
        
        Install
        ---------
        
        If the project were uploaded to pypi, it would be a simple:
        
        ```
        pip install django-devotionals
        ```
        
        But it's not, so don't try.
        
        Else you could follow whatever procedure you use to install python packakges (easy_install, etc)
        
        Configuration
        --------------
        
        Currently there is little to configure. The important part is to wire it up in your django project:
        
        ```
        INSTALLED_APPS = (
            ...
            'devotionals',
            ...
        )
        ```
        
        In your urls:
        
        ```
        urlpatterns += patterns('',
            ...
            (r'^devotionals/', include('devotionals.urls')),
            ...
        )
        ```
        
        Templates (& URLs)
        --------------------
        
        All templates go in a 'devotionals' directory in your TEMPLATE_DIR:
        
        ```
        devotional_list.html (/)
        
        devotional_year_archive.html (/<YYYY>/)
        
        devotional_month_archive.html (/<YYYY>/<MMM>/)
        
        devotional_detail.html (/<YYYY>/<MMM>/<DD>/)
        ```
