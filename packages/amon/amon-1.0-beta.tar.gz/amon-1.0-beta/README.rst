==================================================================

Introduction
=============

Amon was designed with one goal in mind - to help you completely monitor
your web applications. 


**1. System monitoring**

Monitor the core metrics of your servers - RAM, CPU, disk space, etc.

**2. Process monitoring**

Monitor the CPU and RAM usage. Add new process with 1 line of 
code. Master/worker aware - perfect for monitoring web servers

**3. Application logging**

Log events, user and performance data. Amon allows you to log any datastructure,  
so you can log dictionaries, hashes, arrays, etc. 
Navigate quickly through your log data with a nice and clean web interface


**4. Exception logging**

Catch and log Rails, Django, Node.js exceptions out of the box. Easy extendable to any 
language/framework that supports http and json
