Description: pydistancematrix
        =================
        
        pydistancematrix will partition a list of edges based on a hard limit of
        nodes per graph.
        
        Essentially, this module will take a graph and partition it into subgraphs
        of a hard limit size, returning both the lists of nodes in each sub-graph,
        and the list of edges that are 'cut' by the partitioning.
        
        For example::
        
            >>> import distancematrix
        
            >>> distancematrix.matrix_calls([
                (1, 2),
                (2, 3),
                (7, 8),
                (9, 10)], limit=3)
            [[1, 2, 3], [7, 8], [9, 10]], []
