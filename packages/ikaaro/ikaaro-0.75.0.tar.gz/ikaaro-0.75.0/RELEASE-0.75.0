ikaaro 0.75.0 (beta) - 2012/07/26
==================================

This is a CMS and web framework written in Python. Learn more about it at:

  http://www.hforge.org/ikaaro


This major release is labeled as beta because the upgrade logic is not
yet available, we will drop the "beta" label when this is done.

Some features have been dropped in this release:
- the ability to setup several web-sites in a single ikaaro instance
- the tracker module (will eventually come back in a future release)
- the three-state workflow (replaced by sharing as part of the access
  control overhaul)

Most changes in this release are addressed to developers rather than
end users, improving ikaaro as a web-framework.

Major changes
---------------------

Fields. The way a resource schema is defined has been re-done with the
introduction of fields:

- Resource.class_schema has been replaced by fields. It is easier to
  override fields defined by a parent class, and they are used by
  autoadd/autoedit (see below) to automatize views.

- Files are now fields, this allows a resource to have several files
  attached to it (for instance: user.avatar, user.cv.en, etc.)

- New AutoAdd/AutoEdit views replace NewInstance/DBResource_Edit. They make
  much easier to write automatic add/edit views for resources.

Access Control has been rewritten. There are two major changes:

- Now access is defined in terms of a database search. This has allowed to
  fix long-standing bug #535.

- The back-office offers extended possibilities to configure accees rights.
  Access control is now defined in terms of: user groups, permissions,
  ownership, access rules and sharing.

Timeout events (cron). There is a new programming interface that allows
to easily define events for a resource. This is used for instead by the
Agenda module, to send email reminders when some event approaches.

Dynamic models. There is now a mechanism that allows to define types of
resources in the database. This feature is not yet visible in a bare
ikaaro, but it may be useful in ikaaro-based applications: defining a
new kind of resource, and adding custom fields to it through a web
interface.

The Calendar module has been renamed to Agenda and has been much improved:
support for recurrence rules, reminders, better user interface, now events
are attached to calendars (ala Google), etc.

There is now a RESTful WebServices interface, details are available in
the documentation.

User visible changes
---------------------

There are many big and small user interface improvements:

- The configuration back-office has been much improved with a ton of big
  and small changes to discover.
- Add view to remove a resource from the resource.
- Improve uploading and extracting Zip files
- Add support for OOXML files.
- Search form, do an AndQuery (instead of OrQuery) in search terms.
- The registration form is back, it includes a captcha, and can be configured
  through /config/register
- Users are not folders anymore, but they have an avatar. Users cannot be
  removed but deactivated from the back-office.

Programming interface
---------------------

Besides the major features seen above, there are many smaller improvements
to the programmint interface:

- New DynamicEnumerate base classes. This simplifies creating resources in
  the database that define a set of choices (to build enumerate fields).
- Add get_brain_value method.
- The autoform has a richer namespace, this allows to easily define custom
  templates.
- New search field 'base_classes' allows to search the database for resources
  which have some parent class.  This replaces 'is_folder', 'is_image' etc.
- There is the beginnings of a template system for emails.
- Table resources have been removed. Now everything should be a resource.
- Now comments are resources on their own.
- The 'OrderedFolder' class allows to order items in a folder.
- Now 'make_resource' can take a path instead of a name.
- Update jquery to 1.5.2

System administrators
---------------------

Changes to the configuration file:
- New "log-email" option': if set an email will be sent to the given email
  address whenever an internal server error (500) happens.
- New "cron-interval" option: controls how ofter the cron manager is run.
- Option "auth-cookie-expires" renamed to "session-timeout".

Security:
- Use SHA256 and salt for new passwords.

Performance:
- Now the static files at '/ui/' are served using specific logic, and much
  faster than before.
