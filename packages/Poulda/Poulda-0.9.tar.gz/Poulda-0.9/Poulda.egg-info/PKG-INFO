Description: Poulda is a simple file upload web service. It comes from a need I
        have to receive large files from friends and family who would not be
        bothered to use FTP or anything more complex than a web browser
        interface. Amongst its features are such diverse elements as:
        
        - only authenticated users may upload a file;
        
        - user accounts (login and password) are configured in the WSGI
          configuration file;
        
        - a progress bar appears during the upload (unless you disabled
          JavaScript);
        
        - relatively old browsers should be supported relatively well;
        
        - the user interface is in English or French, hopefully not both at
          the same time.
        
        For further details, see the documentation at `<http://packages.python.org/Poulda>`_ (or in the ``docs/`` folder in the source).
