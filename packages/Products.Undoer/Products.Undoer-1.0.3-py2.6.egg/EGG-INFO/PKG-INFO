Description: What is Undoer?
        
        Undoer is a product/patch that enables transactions to be undone based
        on a date.  Useful if you or someone else has managed to make a lot of
        separate changes that would be cumbersome to undo the usual Zope way
        and no recent (enough) backups are available.  See the Undo tab in the
        Zope Management Interface for instructions on how to use it.
        
        The original script was developed by Nidelven IT for Huridocs (who
        paid for it) and later re-written by Nidelven IT for use by the Zope
        community.
        
        It is available from
        
          http://www.nidelven-it.no/d
        
        and any questions/comments can be sent to info@nidelven-it.no
