0.6 No pity for insane bloat removal

    Backward compatibility break: {% autocomplete_light_static %} was removed.
    Instead, use {% include 'autocomplete_light/static.html' %} as demonstrated
    in the "Quick start" documentation.

    Note that autocomplete_light/static.html does not include
    cities_light/autocomplete.js, so you have to load it yourself now.

    No backward compatibility break.

    - Bugfix in generic channel example: demonstrate how to query_filter on
      multiple queryset types.
    - Bugfix in GenericForeignKeyField: allow none value.
    - Enhancement: autocomplete_light.contrib.generic_m2m supports generic many
      to many relations.
    - Enhancement: allow registration of model with custom channel attributes,
      this allows to register a model with another "search_name" than "name"
      without subclassing.
    - Documentation improvements.
