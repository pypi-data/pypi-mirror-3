===========

Pygmyplot is a simplified wrapper around matplotlib_, designed to
make it easier to embed specific types of matplotlib plots
into Tkinter_ applications while retaining matplotlib
levels of configurability.
The idea behind pygmyplot is similar to that
of `python megawidgets (PMW)`_, although the interface to pygmyplot
is not intended to be similar to PMW.
The four types of plots currently supported by pygmyplot are:

* X-Y Plots
* Scatter Plots
* Histograms
* Heat Maps
