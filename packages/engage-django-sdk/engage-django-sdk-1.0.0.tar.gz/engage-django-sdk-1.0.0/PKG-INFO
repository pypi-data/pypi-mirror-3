Description: =================
        Engage Django SDK
        =================
        
        Engage is an open source platform for deploying and managing
        applications, either on your own servers or in the public cloud.
        It automates server provisioning, application installation,
        configuration, and upgrades.
        
        This Python package distribution is an SDK which enables you to
        package your Django applications for deployment via Engage. 
        Currently, only deployment on genForma's servers is supported.
        Support for deploying on your own servers (or development machine)
        will be forthcoming in a future release. If you would like to
        participate in beta testing of either the cloud or on-premises version
        of Engage, please contact support@genforma.com.
        
        Two documents are available to help you with this SDK:
         1. The Quickstart Guide at http://beta.genforma.com/doc-django-quickstart.html (also available in source form in the included quickstart_guide.rst file).
         2. The Reference manual at http://beta.genforma.com/sdk_refman/index.html (also available in source form in the refman subdirectory).
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        This package requires setuptools
        (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools).  If you download the SDK
        archive to your system, you can install it using *easy_install* as follows::
        
          easy_install <archive_name>
        
        Alternatively, you can use *pip* for the installation. You can also
        skip the downloading step and install it directly from the Python
        Package Index (http://pypi.python.org)::
        
          easy_install engage-django-sdk
