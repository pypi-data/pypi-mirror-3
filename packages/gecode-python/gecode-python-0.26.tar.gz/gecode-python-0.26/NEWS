* version 0.26

** support for Gecode 3.7.2

* version 0.25

** support for search statistics
** support for search limits (implicit stop objects)

* Version 0.24

** support for extensional constraints
   new module gecode.fsa for constructing finite state automata
** module gecode.domain for (de)coding finite domains
** support for Reify (for upcoming gecode 4.0.0)
** Space.values(X) now also works for BoolVars

* Version 0.23

  Support for writing search engines:

** s.status() returns the status of space s
** s.choice() returns a Choice object
** s.commit(Choice, int) commits s to an alternative of the Choice
** if c is a Choice, c.alternatives() is the number of alternatives
** s.constrain(sol) constrain s to be better than solution sol

* Version 0.22

** support for restart search engine:
   s.search(restart=True)
** support for search options
   s.search(threads=N1, c_d=N2, a_d=N3)
** support for keeping only some of the variables
   s.keep(V)
   if some variables are thus marked as "kept", then only
   these variables will be explicitly copied during search.
   This could bring substantial benefits in memory usage.
   Of course, in a solution, you can then only look at variables
   that have been "kept".  If no variable is marked as "kept",
   then they are all kept.  Thus marking variables as "kept" is
   purely an optimization.
** support for Gist
    s.gist(onclick=None, threads=None, c_d=None, a_d=None)
    if your installation of Gecode has Gist support, then this will invoke it.
    onclick is an inspector or an iterable of inspectors.  An inspector is
    a callable, or a class whose instances are callables, that has/have been
    specially annoted by a decorator:

    @inspector("My Inspector 1")
    def show1(s2):
        print s2.values([X1,X2])

    Note that s2 is not necessarily a solution!  You may also define a
    textinspector to show textual output in a graphical window:

    @textinspector("My Inspector 2")
    def show2(s2):
        return "X1=%s X2=%s" % s2.values([X1,X2])

    A textinspector must return a string.
