"""
Bento, a pythonic packaging solution for python software.

Bento is a packaging solution which aims at being simple and extensible, using
as little magic as possible. Packages are described in a bento.info file which
has a straightforward syntax, and the packaging is driven through bentomaker,
the command line interfance to bento. Sane API are provided so that people can
build their own deployment facilities on top of it.

The code is currently organized as follows:
    - bento.core.parser: ply-based lexer/parser for the format
    - bento.core: core facilities to build package representation
    - bento.commands: commands as provided by bentomaker
    - bento.private: bundled packages
    - bento.compat: compatibility code to provide consistent API to all
      supported python versions (2.4 -> 2.7 ATM)
