        Development happens at https://github.com/chrneumann/kotti_contactform
        
        Setup
        =====
        
        To enable the extension in your Kotti site, activate the configurator:
        
          kotti.configurators = kotti_contactform.kotti_configure
        
        ``kotti_contactform`` uses ``pyramid_mailer`` for sending mails and
        tries to use your mailserver at localhost:25. If these defaults don't
        fit your needs, you have to configure ``pyramid_mailer``:
        http://packages.python.org/pyramid_mailer/
        
        Database upgrade
        ================
        
        If you upgrade from version 0.1.0 to 0.1.1 you have to migrate your 
        database. The migration is performed with `alembic`_. For the migration
        you have to install alembic with::
        
          $ python setup.py install
        
        or rerun your buildout. The migration is performed with::
        
          $ alembic -c development.ini upgrade head
        
        For integration of alembic in your environment please refer to the 
        `alembic documentation`_. If you have problems with the upgrade, 
        please create a new issue in the `tracker`_.
