js.jquery_elastic
*****************

Introduction
============

This library packages `jQuery Elastic`_ for `fanstatic`_.

.. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
.. _`jQuery Elastic`: http://unwrongest.com/projects/elastic/

This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
directory in ``js.jquery_elastic``) are published to some URL.
