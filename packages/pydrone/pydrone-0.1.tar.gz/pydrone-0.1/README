pydrone allows you to pass a basic python object (list, tuple, string, unicode, int, log, float and dictionary) to a sandboxed javascript
environment that will evaluate your defined code and returns a value. This value is re-converted to a python object.

Yes yes, the introduction looks like a nonsense. Code is better than words...


import pydrone

code = """
a = data + 17;
a;
"""

my_number = 30

print pydrone.js(code, my_number)
