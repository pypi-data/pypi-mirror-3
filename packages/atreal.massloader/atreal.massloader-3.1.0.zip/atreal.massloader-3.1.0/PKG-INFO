        atreal.massloader Package Readme
        ================================
        
        Overview
        --------
        MassLoader allows to do massive uploads via Zip or 7Zip files. When an archive
        is uploaded via MassLoader, its contents are created in the current folder.
        
        Description
        -----------
        
        * MassLoader creates Files and Images or only Files with files in archive.
        * MassLoader add an action on Folder, Large Plone Folder and Plone Site. You can
        change theses portal types in the control panel.
        * MassLoader has a content size limit, and is able to protect your server from
        logic bombs.
        * MassLoader can handle any size of archive file, without overload of your server.
        
        
        Important
        ---------
        
        * The permission is only set by default to the role 'Manager' and 'Owner'.
        * From the version 3.0.0beta1, the portal type of new object can be managed via
        2 mechanisms, selectable in the control panel :
          * If content type registry detects an Image, MassLoader creates an Image, if
            it's not an image MassLoader creates a file with the portal type selected
            in Control Panel
          * Or the checkbox is checked in Control Panel and Massloader creates only
            files with the portal type selected in Control Panel
        * Default max size for each file to be uncompressed is set to 20 Mb. You can
        modify this size limit in the control panel.
        * If a folder with a same id already exists, it is conserved. If a same file
        exists whith the same id, just the datas are updated.
        
        
        Issues
        ------
        
        * 7zip archives are not valid when they contain only empty folders (problem with
        python library pylzma)
        * 7zip archives with empty folders : the empty folders are not created
