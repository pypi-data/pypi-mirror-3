Installation
============

To install eea.daviz into the global Python environment (or a workingenv),
using a traditional Zope 2 instance, you can do this:

 * When you're reading this you have probably already run
   ``easy_install eea.daviz``. Find out how to install setuptools
   (and EasyInstall) here:
   http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall

 * If you are using Zope 2.9 (not 2.10), get `pythonproducts`_ and install it
   via::

       python setup.py install --home /path/to/instance

   into your Zope instance.

 * Create a file called ``eea.daviz-configure.zcml`` in the
   ``/path/to/instance/etc/package-includes`` directory.  The file
   should only contain this::

       <include package="eea.daviz" />

.. _pythonproducts: http://plone.org/products/pythonproducts


Alternatively, if you are using zc.buildout and the plone.recipe.zope2instance
recipe to manage your project, you can do this:

  * Add ``eea.daviz`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.::

      [buildout]
      eggs = eea.daviz

  * Tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug::

      [instance]
      recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
      zcml = eea.daviz

  * Re-run buildout, e.g. with::

      $ ./bin/buildout

You can skip the ZCML slug if you are going to explicitly include the package
from another package's configure.zcml file.

Portal Property for Google Maps Api Key:

In ZMI -> portal_properties add a plone property sheet called
geographical_properties and inside it add a new string property
called google_key.

In this property you have to paste the google maps API KEY, follow instruction
https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/v2/introduction#Obtaining_Key

The google account you use to generate the key has to be owner of the site,
this is done by verification via google webmaster tools.
