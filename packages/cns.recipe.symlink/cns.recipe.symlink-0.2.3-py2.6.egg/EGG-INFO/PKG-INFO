Description: ================================
        Introduction
        ================================
        
        This recipe makes it easy to create symbolic links on Unix variants. Links can be
        specified one by one, or in bulk. Various shortcuts are provided to avoid unnecessary
        repetition of source & target paths, etc.
        
        Warning: If you're going to be linking to directories, **make sure** to see the wiki
        `page <https://github.com/koodaamo/cns.recipe.symlink/wiki/zc.buildout-bug-%23144228>`_
        on how to work around zc.buildout bug #144228. Otherwise your buildout will fail.
        
        Common options
        ===================
        
         - *symlink_base* option may contain a common (source) base directory for symlinking,
           when links are created for many items from the same directory.
         - *symlink_target* may contain common target directory, when links are created in the
           same directory.
         - *autocreate* causes a target directory to be created if it does not exist
        
        
        Specifying individual links
        =============================
        
         - *symlink* option contains one or more values in format source=target
        
        Example 1::
        
         [symlinks]
         symlink = ~/work/MyProj = ${buildout:directory}/products
         autocreate = true
        
        
        If a common *symlink_target* is specified, *symlink* can be in format: source= (omitting target directory)
        
        Specifying links in bulk
        ==========================
        
        Links can be created for all items in a directory given via *symlink_base*, all buildout
        eggs, and all development eggs. When links are created in bulk, they are always created
        in directory given by *symlink_target*.
        
        There's also a special option to constrain bulk link creation:
        
         - *ignore* option contains one or more wildcard expressions for choosing items that will
           be ignored, ie. no links will be created for them
        
        
        For files in directory
        ------------------------
        
        If *symlink_base* & *symlink_target* are specified, but no *symlink* option is given,
        links are created for all items found in the (source) base directory. Furthermore, even
        if *symlink* option is used, links can still also be created for all items in
        *symlink_base* by giving the *bulk* option that forces bulk link creation even if
        individual *symlink* specification is used.
        
        Example 2::
        
         [symlinks]
         symlink_base = ~/work/
         symlink_target = ${buildout:directory}/products
         ignore = *.tmp
        
        
        For eggs in buildout
        ---------------------
        
        There are two options to generate symlinks for eggs downloaded to a buildout.
        
         - *eggs*
         - *develop*
        
        The *ignore option* can be used here as well.
        
        Example 3::
        
         eggs = true
         develop = true
         ignore = *.tar.gz
                  *.zip
         symlink_target = ${buildout:directory}/products
