Release History
---------------

0.4.0 (2012-05-05)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Issue #8: Replace ContextStack with ExitStack (old ContextStack API
  retained for backwards compatibility)
* Fall back to unittest2 if unittest is missing required functionality


0.3.1 (2012-01-17)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Issue #7: Add MANIFEST.in so PyPI package contains all relevant files


0.3 (2012-01-04)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Issue #5: ContextStack.register no longer pointlessly returns the wrapped
  function
* Issue #2: Add examples and recipes section to docs
* Issue #3: ContextStack.register_exit() now accepts objects with __exit__
  attributes in addition to accepting exit callbacks directly
* Issue #1: Add ContextStack.preserve() to move all registered callbacks to
  a new ContextStack object
* Wrapped callbacks now expose __wrapped__ (for direct callbacks) or __self__
  (for context manager methods) attributes to aid in introspection

* Added NEWS.rst (and incorporated into documentation)


0.2 (2011-12-15)

  using the module for anything, since I didn't alias the old name at all)
