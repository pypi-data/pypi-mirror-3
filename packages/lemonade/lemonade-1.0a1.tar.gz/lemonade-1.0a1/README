Lemonade is a Python port of the LEMON Parser Generator written by
D. Richard Hipp:

    http://www.hwaci.com/sw/lemon/

This is the initial, alpha release of Lemonade.  Currently, Lemonade
generates a parser written in C (just as the original LEMON does).
Thus, Lemonade is superfluous at present; after all, why not just use
LEMON?

This coming August, Lemonade will be modified so as to generate Python
code instead.  Since Python is a dynamic language, Lemonade will
enable client software to generate a parser from a .y file, and then
use the generated parser on the fly.
