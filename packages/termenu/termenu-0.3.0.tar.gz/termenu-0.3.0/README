Abstract
--------

Termenu is a utility to display inline inteeractive menus in commmand line scripts.

Name
----

Termenu is a combination of the words terminal and menu.

Description
-----------

Traditionally there are two types of applications running the Unix shell: pure
command line utilities such as grep, sed and awk and full screen interactive
applications such as Midnight Commander. Termenu aims to bridge this gap and
allow a modicum of interactivity in regular command line utilities. A common
example is finding and editing a file located somewhere in the directory tree.
The usual way to do this is to run:

$ find . -name the_file_i_need.txt


Examples
--------

Choose a recent commit (for i.e. cherry-pick):

$ git log --pretty=format:'%h -%d %s (%cr)' | ./termenu -w80 -r10 -m | sed "s/ - .*//"
