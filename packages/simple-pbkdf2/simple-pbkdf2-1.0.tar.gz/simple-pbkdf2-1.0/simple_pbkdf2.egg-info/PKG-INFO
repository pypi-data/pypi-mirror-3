Description: PBKDF2 for Python because bcrypt is overkill
        
        Unlike bcrypt this is easy to understand, secure enough given a sufficently
        random salt and implemented on top of the stdlib in about 20 lines of code.
        Also easy to understand and analyze.
        
        Tests included.
        
        Happy hashing.
