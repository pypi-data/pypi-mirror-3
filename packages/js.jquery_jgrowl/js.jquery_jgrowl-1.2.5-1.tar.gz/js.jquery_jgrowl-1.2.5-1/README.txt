js.jquery_jgrowl
****************

Introduction
============

This library packages `jQuery jGrowl`_ for `fanstatic`_. It is aware of different modes (normal, minified).

.. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
.. _`jQuery jGrowl`: http://www.stanlemon.net/projects/jgrowl.html

This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
directory in ``js.jquery_jgrowl``) are published to some URL.
