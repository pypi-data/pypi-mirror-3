        .. rubric::A business process management tool that can be extended to
                   support a range of business processes.
        
        Lokai is a flexible business process management tool that enables
        teams to work together, and places those teams in the context of a
        wider business. A single instance of the tool can handle as many
        projects or tasks as required, with no need to deploy separate project
        or process specific environments that cannot share data.
        
        The tool freely mixes documentation, activity management and data
        access in ways that are appropriate to the project, process or task
        in hand. There is no constraint on how this might be done, and
        different tasks or projects may use different arrangements within the
        same environment.
        
        Access management allows people to see and manipulate data in ways
        that are appropriate to their role and work. Team members may work on
        more than one task or project. Managers may manage more than one
        project. A person can be a team member on one project and a manager on
        another.
        
        The key to this flexibility is a hierarchical data model with
        interlinking between sub-trees. The structure and the links are fully
        user controlled.
        
        Lokai is a web served application, written in Python.
        
        The code itself is written in an extendable manner that allows a
        great deal of flexibility in the type of data represented, and in the
        presentation of that data. Each node in the hierarchy can be
        different. At its simplest, this allows for activities and
        documentation to be held in the same structure, so that everything
        relevant to the project or process is to hand. Whatever data is being
        handled, the user is presented with a consistent interface where
        access rules and navigation are given.
        
        Requirements
        --------------------
        
        Lokai requires Python 2.5 or higher. Python 3.0 is not yet supported.
        
        Other dependencies:
        
          Posgtgresql
        
          SqlAlchemy (version 0.6)
        
          Werkzeug
        
          PyUtilib
        
          Docutils
        
          Reportlab
        
        Lokai is developed under Linux and is currently being run under
        Ubuntu. Lokai itself does not use C extensions and the intention is
        that the development is independent of operating system. However, no
        tests have been done on other operating systems, or on other
        distributions.
        
        Install
        --------------------
        
        Download the package tarball and unpack it. Go into the distribution
        directory and run::
        
          python setup.py install
        
        or, more simply, don't bother with the download and just type::
        
          pip install lokai
        
        To build a workable instance:
        
          Create a working directory for your new instance. And change into it.
        
          Copy ``lk_config.ini`` from the ``config`` folder of
          the installation.
        
          Review the content of the ``.ini`` file. It should work out of the
          box. However, you might want to change the default database name to
          something other than ``lokai_soft``.
        
          Create the database::
        
            tb_migrate.py login.login_db=max
        
            tb_migrate.py lk_worker.nodes_db=max
        
          Copy ``initial_data.yml`` from the ``doc/initial_settings`` folder
          of the installation. This contains a basic administrator login and a
          starting node for the database.
        
          Use the initial data::
        
            lk_initial_data -f initial_data.yml
        
          For a quick hit, start the publisher stand alone::
          
            python -mlokai.lk_ui.publisher
        
          Now browse to localhost:8080.
