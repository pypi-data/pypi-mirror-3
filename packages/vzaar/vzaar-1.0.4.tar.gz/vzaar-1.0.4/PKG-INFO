Description: ##python-vzaar
        This is a wrapper for Vzaar's version 1.0 API. As of this repository's initial
        commit, all documented API methods are implemented.
        
        The most up-to-date version of this code will be available at https://github.com/fourk/vzaar
        
        The original API documentation can be found at http://developer.vzaar.com/docs/version_1.0/
        
        ###Usage:
        
        Install using setuptools, pip, or by cloning the repository and running:
        
            python setup.py intall
        
        Once installed, it can be used with:
        
            from vzaar import Vzaar
            api = Vzaar(username, api_key, video_sucess_redirect, max_video_size)
        
            api.user_details(username)
        
        If you're using django, you can define the values in your settings object instead
        of having to set them when you instantiate the api object. Add each of the following
        to your settings, then import DjangoVzaar instead of importing Vzaar.
        
            VZAAR_USERNAME - string - your username (not your email)
            VZAAR_KEY - string - Vzaar API key
            VIDEO_SUCCESS_REDIRECT - string - where to redirect a user after upload
                    ex: http://example.com/callback/
            MAX_VIDEO_SIZE - integer - size (in bytes) of maximum alowed upload size
        
        Once the above keys are defined in your settings.py file, you can use the api like so:
        
            from vzaar import DjangoVzaar
            api = DjangoVzaar()
