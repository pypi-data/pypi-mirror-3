Filter Learning

Imprinting
   As suggested by Serre et al [1]_, prototypes may be generated from training
   data by chosing C1 neighborhoods at random location and scales.
Shuffling
   Prototypes are copied from some existing set, and the order of elements in
   each prototype is randomized.
Uniform
   Prototypes are generated by sampling each component independently from the
   uniform distribution over :math:`[0,1]`.
Histogram
   Prototypes are generated by sampling each component independently from a
   distribution, which is estimated from an existing set of prototypes.
Normal
   Prototypes are generated by sampling each component independently from a
   normal distribution :math:`N\left(\mu, \sigma^2\right)`, where :math:`\mu`
   and :math:`\sigma` are estimated from an existing set of prototypes.
