    Abstract test definition.

    Test definitions allow lava-test to install, remove, run and parse log
    files of automatic tests. While the interface can be implemented directly
    you should use :class:`lava_test.core.tests.Test` that implements the core
    logic and allow you to customize the parts that are needed by providing
    delegates implementing :class:`~lava_test.api.delegates.ITestInstaller`,
    :class:`~lava_test.api.delegates.ITestRunner` and
    :class:`~lava_test.api.delegates.ITestParser`.

        Install the test program.

        This creates an install directory under the user's XDG_DATA_HOME
        directory to mark that the test is installed.  The installer's
        install() method is then called from this directory to complete any
        test specific install that may be needed.

            Observer object that makes it possible to monitor the actions
            performed by the test installer.

class ITestProvider(_Interface):
    """
    Source of ITest instances.

    Test providers can be used to make lava-test aware of arbitrary collections
    of tests that can be installed and invoked. Internally lava-test uses this
    class to offer built-in tests (via the
    :class:`~lava_test.providers.BuiltInProvider`), out-of-tree tests (via the
    :class:`~lava_test.providers.PkgResourcesProvider`) and declarative tests
    (via the :class:`~lava_test.providers.RegistryProvider`).

    Normally this is not something you would need to implement. If you have a
    large collection of existing tests that can be somehow adapted in bulk, or
    you have your own internal registry of tests that could be adapted this way
    then you might use this interface to simplify test discovery.

    Test providers need to be registered using pkg-resources entry-point
    feature and then added to the lava-test configuration file. See
    :class:`lava_test.config.LavaTestConfig` for details.
