        Quickstart
        -----------
        Create a virtual environment for your project and activate it::
        
            $ virtualenv mysite-env
            $ source mysite-env/bin/activate
            (mysite-env)$
            
        Next install Pinax::
        
            (mysite-env)$ pip install Pinax
            
        Once Pinax is installed use **pinax-admin**  to create a project for your site
        ::
        
            (mysite-env)$ pinax-admin setup_project mysite -b basic mysite
        
        
        The example above will create a starter django project in the mysite folder based on the Pinax **basic** project. Of ccourse you can use any of the Pinax starter Projects.  The **basic** project provides features such as 
        basic account management as well as user profiles and notifications. The project also comes with a theme - a collection css, javascript files and default templates based on Twitter Bootstrap. 
        
        To use the **zurb-foundation** theme in the project, include "pinax-theme-foundation" in requirements/project.txt. Edit the **settings.py** file and 
        comment out the entry for "pinax_theme_bootstrap" and add "pinax_theme_foundation" in your INSTALLED APPS::
             
            # theme
            #"pinax_theme_bootstrap",
            "pinax_theme_foundation",
        
        Inside your project run::
        
            (mysite-env)$ python manage.py syncdb
            (mysite-env)$ python manage.py runserver
        
        Change the Site name by editing *fixture/initial_data.json*  you can also use the Admin app for this purpose. 
        
        Your "site_base.html" should extend "theme_base.html" and should provide "footer" and "nav" blocks (the latter should just be a ul of li of a links).
        
        Your pages should have blocks "head_title" and "body" and should extend "site_base.html".
        
        The **url** name "home" should be defined as the homepage.
        
        Foundation is 100% responsive so that you may want to add the following to the project style sheet *static/site_sytles.css*
        to handle larger displays::
        
        	row {
        	  max-width: 980px; 
        	}
        
        
        Forms
        -----
        
        This theme ships with a basic template tag for rendering forms that match
        the markup expected by foundation
        
        To style forms, add the following to the top of your template ::
            
            {% load foundation_tags %}
        
        and include your form using the following markup: ::
            
            <form method="POST" action="">
                {% csrf_token %}
                <fieldset class="form-controls">
                    {{ form|as_foundation }}
                </fieldset>
                <fieldset class="form-actions">
                    <button type="submit" class="button medium radius nice"">Submit</button>
                </fieldset>
            </form>
