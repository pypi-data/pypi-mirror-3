     * @param method the Method instance corresponding to the
     * interface method invoked on the proxy instance. The declaring
     * class of the Method object will be the interface that the
     * method was declared in, which may be a superinterface of the
     * proxy interface that the proxy class inherits the method
     * through.
     * @param args an array of objects containing the values of the
     * arguments passed in the method invocation on the proxy
     * instance, or null if interface method takes no
     * arguments. Arguments of primitive types are wrapped in
     * instances of the appropriate primitive wrapper class, such as
     * java.lang.Integer or java.lang.Boolean.
     * @return the value to return from the method invocation on the
     * proxy instance. If the declared return type of the interface
     * method is a primitive type, then the value returned by this
     * method must be an instance of the corresponding primitive
     * wrapper class; otherwise, it must be a type assignable to the
     * declared return type. If the value returned by this method is
     * null and the interface method's return type is primitive, then
     * a NullPointerException will be thrown by the method invocation
     * on the proxy instance. If the value returned by this method is
     * otherwise not compatible with the interface method's declared
     * return type as described above, a ClassCastException will be
     * thrown by the method invocation on the proxy instance.
     * @exception Throwable the exception to throw from the method
     * invocation on the proxy instance. The exception's type must be
     * assignable either to any of the exception types declared in the
     * throws clause of the interface method or to the unchecked
     * exception types java.lang.RuntimeException or
     * java.lang.Error. If a checked exception is thrown by this
     * method that is not assignable to any of the exception types
     * declared in the throws clause of the interface method, then an
     * UndeclaredThrowableException containing the exception that was
     * thrown by this method will be thrown by the method invocation
     * on the proxy instance.
