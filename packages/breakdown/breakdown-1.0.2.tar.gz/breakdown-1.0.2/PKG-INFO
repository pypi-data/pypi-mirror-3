        ===========
        
        Breakdown is a lightweight python webserver that parses jinja2 templates.  It's intended to be used by designers for doing rapid prototyping.
        
        
        Basic Usage
        ===========
        
        Breakdown needs a ``templates`` directory and a ``static`` directory to serve from.  If your working directory contains these, you can simply run breakdown with no arguments::
        
            $ breakdown
        
        Or, you can specify the path to a directory containing ``templates`` and ``static``::
        
            $ breakdown /path/to/project
        
        Breakdown will also work with a django project structure.  If the project path contains an ``apps`` directory, breakdown will automatically detect this and combine the ``static`` and ``templates`` directories for each django app.  You'll also get a listing of the directories it found.  Here's the output of running breakdown on a django project with two apps: 'mainsite' and 'blog'::
        
            $ breakdown ~/django/myproject
            Serving templates from:
              /Users/josh/django/myproject/apps/blog/templates
              /Users/josh/django/myproject/apps/mainsite/templates
        
            Serving static data from:
              /Users/josh/django/myproject/apps/blog/static
              /Users/josh/django/myproject/apps/mainsite/static
        
        Viewing Templates
        -----------------
        
        Once breakdown is running, it will print the local URL the webserver is listening on::
        
            Server running at http://127.0.0.1:5000 ...
        
        You can now view templates in your browser by navigating to http://127.0.0.1:5000.  However, you won't see anything here unless one of your template directories contains a file named ``index.html``.  The URL of any template (besides ``index.html``) will be identical to its filename, with all relative paths preserved.  Below is an example of template filenames and their corresponding URL on the local server:
        
        ==================== ====================================
        **Template**         **URL**
        -------------------- ------------------------------------
        index.html           http://127.0.0.1:5000/
        article.html         http://127.0.0.1:5000/article
        blog/index.html      http://127.0.0.1:5000/blog
        blog/post.html       http://127.0.0.1:5000/blog/post
        ==================== ====================================
        
        *Note: The server will accept template URLs with or without .html appended to them*
        
        Additional Features
        ===================
        
        Template tags
        -------------
        
        For convenience, A few template functions have been added to the `jinja2 template API <http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/templates/>`_:
        
        ################
        {{ greeking() }}
        ################
        
        Generates a block of randomized lorem ipsum text marked-up with various HTML elements: ``<em>``, ``<strong>``, ``<code>``, ``<a>``, ``<ol>``, and ``<ul>``.
        
        ##########################
        {{ image(width, height) }}
        ##########################
        
        If you have `PIL <http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/>`_ installed, you can use this function to generate an ``<img>`` tag with a sample image of the specified size (without PIL, the width/height are ignored and you get a large sample image)
        
        CleverCSS
        ---------
        
        Breakdown also supports automatic `CleverCSS <http://http://sandbox.pocoo.org/clevercss/>`_ parsing.  If the file ``foo.css`` is requested and not found, breakdown will then look for a matching ``foo.clevercss`` and compile it to vanilla css on the fly.
        
            
        Advanced
        ========
        
        **Command line options**:
          -h, --help            show this help message and exit
          -p PORT, --port=PORT  run server on an alternate port (default is 5000)
          -m, --media           treat MEDIA_URL as STATIC_URL in templates
          -v, --version         display the version number and exit
