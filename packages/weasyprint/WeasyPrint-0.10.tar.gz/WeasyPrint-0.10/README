WeasyPrint is a visual rendering engine for HTML and CSS that can export
to PDF. It aims to support web standards for printing. WeasyPrint is free
software released under the BSD license.

It is based on various libraries for parsing, text and drawing but **not**
on full a rendering engines like WebKit on Gecko. The CSS visual rendering
is written in Python and meant to be easy to hack on.
