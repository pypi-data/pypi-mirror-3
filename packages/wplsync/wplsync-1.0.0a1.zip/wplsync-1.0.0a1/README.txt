Python console script to synchronize media folders, using playlists as filter.

  - Read one or more playlists (*.WPL) and copy referenced files to target folder.
  - If no playlist is specified, the complete source media folder will be synchronized.
  - Source directory structure is maintained in the target folder.
  - Duplicate, or otherwise invalid playlist entries are ignored.
  - `-d` option removes unmatched files and empty folders from target.
