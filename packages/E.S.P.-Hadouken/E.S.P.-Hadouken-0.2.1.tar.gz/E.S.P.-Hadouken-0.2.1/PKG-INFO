Description: 
        Drawings stole your Game Boy!  Guide the dot through each drawing's randomized barrage without touching the deadly void.
        
        The primary goal is to beat 5 levels by avoiding the black areas as you navigate to the end.  A secondary goal is to do it as quickly as possible and add your name to the record times list.
