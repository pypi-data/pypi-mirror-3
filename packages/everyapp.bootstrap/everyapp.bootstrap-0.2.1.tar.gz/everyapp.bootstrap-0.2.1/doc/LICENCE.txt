Project Licence
===============

*everyapp.bootstrap* is licensed under the `GNU General Public License version
3`_ or later (`GPLv3+`_).  This is free software: you are free to change and
redistribute it under certain conditions.  There is NO WARRANTY, to the extent
permitted by law.  For the full licence text, see |COPYING.txt|.

Documentation Licence
=====================

The documentation source files (those documentation files included in the
version control system and/or in the source distribution for this project are
considered source code just like the program source code.  They are, therefore,
also licenced under the `GPLv3+`_ just like the rest of the project.

Additionally, all generated forms of *everyapp.bootstrap*'s documentation, such
as, but not limited to, |HTML|, EPUB_, latex, |PDF|, `man pages`_, etc. are
also licenced under the `GPLv3+`_, just like the rest of the project.

.. index:: generated files licence, licence; generated files
.. _generated_files_licence:

Licensing of Generated Files
============================

By default, the generated bootstrap script (typically named |bootstrap.py|)
contains code from this project as well as code from the virtualenv_ project.
When this is the case, it is therefore also licensed under the `GPLv3+`_ as a
derivative work.  Further, if a project includes this file, but does not depend
on it in order to function normally, then the inclusion is considered mere
aggregation and does not make the project a derivative work of
*everyapp.bootstrap*.

All copyrights and moral rights on the the bootstrap configuration file that is
generated by this distribution (|bootstrap.cfg|, by default) are explicitly
disclaimed.  It is in the public domain as it is intended to be copied and
modified by anyone using this distribution.

By submitting a patch, bug report or any other copyrightable material to this
project, you automatically agree to license the contribution under the
`Apache Software License, v. 2.0`_, and further agree that it may be
re-licensed as necessary for inclusion in *everyapp.bootstrap* or other
downstream projects.
