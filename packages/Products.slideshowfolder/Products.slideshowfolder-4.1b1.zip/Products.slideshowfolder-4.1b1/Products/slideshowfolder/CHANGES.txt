History
=======

4.1 - beta (2012-03-02)
-----------------------

- Added .metadata files for skin based images, js and css to get 
  slideshowfolder cacheable.
  [pelle\_]

- Use current plone markup style (folder_listing.pt) to solve the template 
  error when having the Plone Site it self as a slideshow. 
  http://plone.org/products/slideshowfolder/issues/57/view.
  [pelle\_]

- Added basic functional/browser test setup and added a test that covers the 
  case where slideshow is used for the Plone Site root currently raising a 
  template error http://plone.org/products/slideshowfolder/issues/57/view.
  [pelle\_]

- Fixed an error, occured if layout-property was set before making a folder a
  slideshowfolder and then unmaking it again [tom_gross]

- Use correct permission for slideshowsettings-view. [tom_gross]

- Added german translation [tom_gross]

- Updated JavaScript to Slideshow2r147 [tom_gross]

- Fixed AttributeError, if JavaScript was called with wrong context [tom_gross]

4.0 - final (2008-07-30)
------------------------

- Documented workaround for obscure issue with viewing slideshow when logged 
  in, using IE as the browser, and accessing the site at http://localhost/.
  [davisagli]

- Changed the permission checked when deciding whether to display a warning 
  about needing to add images to a slideshow-enabled folder to 'ATContentTypes: 
  Add Image'. Also removed detail about publishing, since images are no longer 
  associated with a workflow by default.

4.0 - release candidate 2 (2008-07-18)
--------------------------------------

- Worked around an obscure Javascript error affecting IE when logged in.
  [davisagli]

- Applied patch for http://code.google.com/p/slideshow/issues/detail?id=28&can=1
  from upstream, which fixes an issue where images weren't displayed when serving
  via a proxy.
  [davisagli]

4.0 - release candidate 1 (2008-07-11)
--------------------------------------

- Added "Slideshowfolder: Manage slideshow settings" permission
  (assigned to Manager, Editor, and Owner roles by default.)
  [davisagli]

- Added i18n infrastructure.
  [davisagli]

- Improved compatibility with things that are not ATImages but implement the 
  same interface (ISlideshowImage).
  [davisagli]

- Switched settings form to use formlib.
  [davisagli]

- Modified mootools 'protect' flag to work around still-present conflict with 
  kupuhelpers.js
  [davisagli]

- Switched to "Slideshow 2" javascript and Mootools 1.2.
  Changes to templates, settings to expose new features.
  [jonstahl]


3.0 alpha 2 - unreleased
------------------------

- Using proper noLongerProvides zope.interface API for removing a marker 
  interface from content object
  [andrewb]

- Removing testJSRegisteryHasResources per no longer present mootools.js, 
  slideshow.js in JS registry. This is now pulled in via a metal slot (see 
  below for more)
  [andrewb]

- Load javascript via a metal slot rather than via the javascript registry, 
  to avoid conflicting with kupu.
  [davisagli]


3.0 alpha 1 - 2007.12.11
------------------------

- Moved registration of "slideshow settings" action to Generic Setup; it gets re-registered in Plone 3.0 to 
  a different action id via a separate profile.


1.2.2 - 2007.12.11
------------------

- Fixed conditional zope.annotations import in a more graceful way.
  [FinnArild]

- Removed newlines from image descriptions; they were breaking the js.  Thanks to "Taun" for finding this.
  [jbaldivieso]

- Fixed another js bug caused by a misplaced comma.
  [jbaldivieso]
  

1.2.1 - 2007.10.29
------------------

- Fixed a minor bug where duration settings were not getting respected due to malformed JS.
  [jbaldivieso]


1.2 - 2007.10.22
----------------

- Finished support for Smart Folders -- slideshows now show up properly for them. (Rich Topics
  are supported.) (issue #14)
  [jbaldivieso]

- Fixed the slideshow settings javascript so that it works in IE.
  [jbaldivieso]

- cleaned up the Generic Setup install steps.  (No bugs were reported, but installation could have
  been a little funny before.)
  [jbaldivieso]

- Slideshows now use full absolute urls for image sources. This should mean that spaces in image
  names are escaped properly.  (issue #15)
  [jbaldivieso]
  

1.1 - 2007.10.04
----------------

- Restructured how the slideshow settings are delivered to the template. Separated out
  the data from the presentation (no more HTML/JS coming directly from the browser view).
  In so doing:
  
  - gave support for Unicode image captions (issue #8)
  - gave skin-level support for filtering slideshow image content based on WF (i.e.,
    showing non-published images in a slideshow is a template change now)
  
  [jbaldivieso]
 
- Modified the slideshow template to give feedback when the folder didn't have content
  for a slideshow (including a message of advice if you are a content editor).  (issue #7)
  [jbaldivieso]

- Uninstall process examines all folders in the catalog and unslideshowifies them (as
  long as you're not reinstalling) (issue #9). Uninstall also removes its traces from
  portal_actions.
  [jbaldivieso]

- Refactored the way slideshows are activated. One switch does it all (including changing
  the view template). All folders may now be activated, regardless of whether they have
  images in them yet. Slideshows may also now be deactivated.
  [jbaldivieso]

- Use backgroundColor from base_properties for slideshow bg color (issue #3).
  [jbaldivieso]


1.0 - 2007.09.??
----------------

- First release.
