js.signals
**********

Introduction
============

This library packages `js-signals`_ for `fanstatic`_.

.. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
.. _`js-signals`: http://millermedeiros.github.com/js-signals/

This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
directory in ``js.signals``) are published to some URL.
