        What is ztfy.file ?
        ===================
        
        ztfy.file is a set of classes to be used with Zope3 application server.
        The purpose of this package is to handle :
         - custom schema fields with their associated properties and browser widgets to
           automatically handle fields as external files
         - automatically handle generation of images thumbnails for any image ; these
           thumbnails are accessed via a custom namespace ("++display++w128.jpeg" for example to get
           a thumbnail of 128 pixels width) and are stored via images annotations
         - allow selection of a square part of a thumbnail to be used as a "mini-square thumbnail".
        
        Square thumbnails selection is based on JQuery package extensions, so the ztfy.jqueryui is
        required to use all functions of ztfy.file package.
