Description: Todo.txt in Python
        ==================
        
        This is a simple todo manager for the console, written in Python and modeled
        after todo.sh from http://todotxt.com.
        
        Why'd I do it? For environments where I can't or don't want to run sh shells.
        That, and for fun, and to learn stuff. The usual.
        
        The home of the project is currently at http://bitbucket.org/Ilkka/todopy
