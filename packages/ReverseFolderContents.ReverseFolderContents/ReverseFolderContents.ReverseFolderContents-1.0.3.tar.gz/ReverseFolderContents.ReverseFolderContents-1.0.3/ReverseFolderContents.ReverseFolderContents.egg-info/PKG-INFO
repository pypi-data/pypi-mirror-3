Description: This product started out as a way to monkeypatch plone so that the
        folder contents was reversed, so it was called
        ReverseFolderContents. However, it was soon found that reversing the
        navigation was necessary as well, and a logical part of how people
        relate to a folder. So here you go, have fun.

        The code in getFolderContents.py is copied from Products.CMFPlone and
        is under the GPL, slightly modified (a few lines added) to work with
        this product.
        
        To the best of my knowledge, the rest of this source code doesn't
        contain any verbatim copies of code except for maybe some import
        statements which can't be written in many different useful ways so the
        thing is available as GPL version 2. But thanks to all the people who
        ask questions and figure things out and put it out on the web where it
        can be found through search engines.
        
        BUGS (or is it a feature?): Reversing of contents does not work when
        not logged in.
        1.0.3
        
        	Added info, bumping version for egg release.
