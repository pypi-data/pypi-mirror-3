 GNU UnRTF (using Cygwin 1.3.10)          v.1.1           27 March 2002

 Copyright (c) 2001 Zachary Thayer Smith

 DESCRIPTION
 -----------
 GNU UnRTF is a moderately complicated converter from RTF to other 
 formats, including HTML, LaTeX, text, and PostScript.  Converting 
 to HTML, it supports tables, fonts, colors, embedded images, 
 hyperlinks, paragraph alignment among other things.

 We added some patches to both fix, err, bugs and to add further 
 capabilities.  Our patches were applied to GNU UnRTF version 0.18.1 
 and can be found on our web site (www.lymeware.com/download_fw.html).
 
 Cygwin is an awesome (and huge) set of tools and a single dll, which 
 allows a user trapped on a win32 machine access to most of the
 GNU and open-source tools available to the rest of us Unix
 developers.  RedHat provides this wonderful tool-set FREE of charge
 and we heavily endorse it.  RedHat is also the source of RedHat Linux
 and other wonderful goodies - check them out at sources.redhat.com.

 THE LICENSE
 -----------
 We are hereby releasing this information and binary in to the public
 domain, as much as we can.

 Because we used the Cygwin development environment, and because
 Cygwin uses all kinds of GNU code and products, we try to do the
 right thing and include every possible license, including the 
 non-restrictive ones.
 
 The source for GNU UnRTF can be found at Zach Smith's site
 (http://www.geocities.com/tuorfa/) and as of two days ago
 was still available (don't forget, this is the "amazing land of
 dissappearing hyper-links" Internet).

 Please see http://sources.redhat.com/cygnus for the appropriate 
 Cygwin  licensing terms and conditions and also visit 
 http://www.gnu.org (for good measure) and familiarize yourself with 
 the GPL in its many versions.


 CONTENTS
 --------
 The zip file includes:

 unrtf.exe:
     This program REQUIRES the cygwin1.dll (version 1.3.10), which must
     exist either in your local directory or in your PATH.
     NOTE: Cygwin does NOT need to be installed for this executible
     to work, if you have the necessary dll.

 unrtf.1:
     A "MAN" page for GNU UnRTF.  You can use the man command in 
     Cygwin, if you installed it.

 README.orig: Original UnRTF readme file.

 unrtf.html: More documentation from the original source 
     distribution.

 readme.txt:
     This file.


 REQUIREMENTS
 ------------
 None, except a win32 machine/OS.


 INSTALLATION
 ------------
 1. Un-zip the unrtf_Win32 (Cygwin) binary release.  We would suggest using winzip (only cause we like it).

 You did it.  Now the fun begins . . .


 SUPPORT
 -------
 If you wish to report a problem with this binary release then please 
 include  all of the following information in any bug report:

    Cygwin.dll Version (we have only tested this release with 1.3.10)
    Operating System Details
    - OS Name, Version
    - Hardware platform
    Problem Description
    - include steps that will reproduce the problem (if known)

 You may report the, ahem, bug to Lymeware at: freeware@lymeware.com
 but I'll warn you ahead of time - we only actively support Solaris
 and Red Hat Linux environments.  Our capacity (inclination AND
 resources) to support Cygwin is limited, to say the least.  If you
 have a problem with other environments we strongly suggest reporting
 the bug to Zach directly at tuorfa@yahoo.com

 Happy un-RTF converting
