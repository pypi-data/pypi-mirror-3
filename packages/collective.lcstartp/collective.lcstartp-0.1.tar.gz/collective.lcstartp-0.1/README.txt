Introduction
============

Linkchecking is a common task for content editors.
Linkcheckers normally go through your site recursivly which
will result in many pages to be checked several times. The
linkchecker start pages tries to avoid this by giving the
linkchecker a page from which every relevant content item can be reached.

Configuration
--------------

In the controlpanel you can define which item types will be listed on
the link checker start page. The startpage itself is reachable at
http://yourdomain.tld/@@linkchecker_startpage_view.html. This page also
gives you an example how to use it with http://linkchecker.sourceforge.net/
