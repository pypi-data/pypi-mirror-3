Description: Introduction
        ------------
        
        This module provides a Django middleware class, 
        ``proxiedssl.middleware.ProxiedSslWsgiMiddleware``, that looks for one of two 
        headers and sets the WSGI URL scheme to the value of the header. This allows a 
        proxy server that handles SSL to notify the Django WSGI request handler that the 
        end user is accessing the site through SSL.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Add ``proxiedssl.middleware.ProxiedSslWsgiMiddleware`` to the 
        ``MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES`` tuple in your settings file. It would be best if it was 
        first so that the ``is_secure`` method is accurate for the other middleware 
        classes.
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        Django and you currently must be using the WSGI handler either through a WSGI 
        server or through the FCGI server which is a wrapper around the WSGI server.
