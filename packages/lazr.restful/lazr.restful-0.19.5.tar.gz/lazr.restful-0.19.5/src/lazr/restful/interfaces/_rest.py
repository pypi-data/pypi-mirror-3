        responsible for modifying the ETag on the way out.

        Setting this value to True will tell lazr.restful that

        does to outgoing ETags, and if this value is set, it will
        strip the modification from incoming ETags that appear to have
        been modified by mod_compress.

        Specifically: if lazr.restful generates an etag '"foo"',
        mod_compress will change it to '"foo"-gzip' or '"foo-gzip"',
        depending on the version. If this value is set to False,

        This is a hacky solution, but until Apache issue 39727 is
