Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        
        This product provides an adapter for collective.plonetruegallery to display
        contentleadimages from collective.contentleadimage.
        
        In the weird case where an object is an image (provides IImageContent) and
        also has a contentleadimage, the contentleadimage is the one displayed in the
        gallery.
        
        
        Installation
        ============

        not require any installation in Plone.
