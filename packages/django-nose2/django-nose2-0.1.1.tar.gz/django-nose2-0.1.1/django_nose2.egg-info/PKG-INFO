Description: Django nose2 test runner
        ========================
        
        A test runner for django 1.2 or better that runs tests with nose2.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        In your settings module, set::
        
          TEST_RUNNER=djnose2.TestRunner
        
        Then ``manage.py test`` will run nose2's test runner.
        
        Notes
        -----
        
        Put command-line arguments for the test runner after '--'. For
        example, to turn on output buffering::
        
          manage.py test -v 2 -- -B
        
        (But really, almost all of the time, you'll want to put your nose2
        configuration in a config file).
