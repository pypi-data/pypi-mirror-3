        Rationale
        =========
        
        Most internet banking systems are capable of exporting account transaction to
        some sort of computer readable formats, but few supports standard data formats,
        like `OFX`_.  On the other hand, personal accounting tools, such as `GnuCash`_
        support standard formats only, and will probably never support proprietary
        statement formats of online banking systems.
        
        To bridge the gap between them, ofxstatement tool was created.

        Mode of operation
        =================
        
        The ``ofxstatement`` tool is intended to be used in the following workflow:
        
        1. At the end of each month, use your online banking service to export
           statements from all of your bank accounts to files in formats, known to
           ofxstatement.
        
        2. Run ``ofxstatement`` on each exported file to convert it to standard OFX
           format.  Shell scripts or Makefile may help to automate this routine.
        
        3. Import generated OFX files to GnuCash or other accounting system.
        
        
        Configuration
        =============
        
        Before first use, ofxstatement should be configured to know about particular
        format of your statement files. Configuration file is stored in
        ``~/.config/ofxstatement/config.ini`` and must be created before first use.
        
        Configuration file format is a standard .ini format. Configuration is divided
        to sections, that corresponds to ``--type`` command line parameter. Each
        section must provide ``plugin`` option that points to one of the registered
        conversion plugins. Other parameters are plugin specific.
        
        Sample configuration file::
        
            [swedbank]
            plugin = swedbank
        
            [dnb]
            plugin = dnb
            charset = cp1257
        
        Such configuration will let ofxstatement to know about two statement file
        format, handled by plugins ``swedbank`` and ``dnb``. ``dnb`` plugin will load
        statements using ``cp1257`` charset.
        
        To convert proprietary ``dnb.csv`` to OFX ``dnb.ofx``, run::
        
            $ ofxstatement -t dnb dnb.csv dnb.ofx
