        CHANGES
        =======
        
        0.6 - 2012-06-20
        ----------------
        
        - introduced a graceful shutdown
        - added a worker registering so restarting workers are not
          impacting the system
        
        0.5 - 2012-06-12
        ----------------
        
        - drastically reduced the number of used FDs, mainly by
          reusing the same context when possible
        
        
        0.4 - 2012-05-25
        ----------------
        
        - the broker exits if there's already a valid broker running
          in the socket.
        - powerhose-broker gained 2 new options: --check and --purge-ghosts
        
        
        0.3 - 2012-05-24
        ----------------
        
        - implemented timeout_max_overflow in the client.
        - the stacks are dumped on worker timeouts
        - now using delayed callbacks for the heartbeat
        
        0.2 - 2012-04-17
        ----------------
        
        - make sure execution errors are properly transmited and raised.
        - fixed the pool of connectors - so every connector is correctly freed
        - now workers can get extra options from the command-line
        
        0.1 - 2012-04-05
        ----------------
