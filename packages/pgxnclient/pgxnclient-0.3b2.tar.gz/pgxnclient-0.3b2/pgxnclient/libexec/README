This directory contains the commands available to pgxn.

Builtin commands are normally implemented as links to the bin/pgxnclient
script. External commands can be added too: if you have written a pgxn
subcommand in any language you can add a symlink here ``pgxn-foo`` to have
your script invoked via ``pgxn foo``.

Note that setuptools doesn't do a perfect job and replaces the links with the
script content, dropping the executable flag. If you are packaging pgxnclient
for a distribution, you may use soft/hard links instead. The location of this
directory may also be changed if your distribution policies prefer a better
location (e.g.  ``/usr/lib/pgxnclient/libexec``...): in this case change the
`LIBEXECDIR` constant in ``pgxnclient/__init__.py`` with the absolute path of
the scripts directory.
