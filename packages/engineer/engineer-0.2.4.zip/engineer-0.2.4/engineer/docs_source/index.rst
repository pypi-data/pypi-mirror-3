Engineer: A Static Website Generator for Fellow Engineers
=========================================================

At its core, Engineer is a static website generator. In other words, Engineer let's you build a website from a bunch
of files - articles written in Markdown, templates, and other stuff - and outputs *another* bunch of files - HTML,
mostly - that you can then copy wherever you want. It has some very nice :ref:`features` that will make you happy,
but it's :ref:`not for everybody <caveats>`.

Engineer was inspired by `Brent Simmons`_, Marco Arment's `Second Crack`_, `Jekyll`_, `Octopress`_, and `Hyde`_.

.. note::
   The Engineer documentation is a work in progress. It is by-and-large up-to-date and the most relevant
   sections are complete, but some of the more 'advanced' sections are not yet complete.
