Description: CassandraLauncher contains two parts:
        1. `cassandralauncher` that is accessible straight from the commandline that launches a Cassandra cluster for you.
        2. `clusterlauncher` that is also accessible from the command line that is a GUI wrapper for AWS and RAX.
        
        Both run off of a config: clusterlauncher.conf.
