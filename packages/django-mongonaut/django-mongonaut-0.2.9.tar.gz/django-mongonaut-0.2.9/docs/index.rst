Features
========

Introspection of Mongo data
----------------------------

    * **[in progress]** Admin determination of which fields are displayed. Currently they can do so in the Document List view but not the Document Detail view.
    * **[in progress]** Introspection via pymongo (so you don't need to define a schema ahead of time). This *might* be too much a jump in scope for this project, requiring a separate project. We'll see.
    * Introspection via mongo engine
    * Q based searches
    * django.contrib.admin style browsing
    * Automatic detection of field types
    * Automatic discovery of collections    
    
Data Management
----------------------------

    * **[in progress]** Editing on ListFields, EmbeddedDocumentsFields, and ReferenceFields
    * **[in progress]** Document Deletes
    * **[in progress]** Admin authored Collection level document control functions    
    * Editing on most other fields 
    * Automatic detection of widget types
    * Text field shorthand for letting user quickly determine type when using without mongoengine
    * Document Adds
    
Permissions
----------------------------

    * **[in progress]** Group defined controls    
    * User level controls
