reprtools
==========

i created reprtools,
because i was annoyed by how i have to write __repr__ in my simple classes

usage::

    from reprtools import FormatRepr

    class User(object):
        __repr__ = FormatRepr("<User {name}>")

        def __init__(self, name):
            self.name = name



 >>> User('test')
 <User test>
