        Introduction
        ------------
        
        collective.prettydate is a package that helps developers to solve some
        usability issues associated with the utilization of absolute date formating on
        sites used among different timezones.
        
        When a date is printed as "01/02/2012" it could represent February 1 or
        January 2, depending on the format used. Also, if the site is located on a
        different timezone, it could take you to situations when today's date is
        printed as yesterday, or tomorrow's date.
        
        collective.prettydate represents dates on a relative format so it would be
        printed as "last month" or "2 months ago", which is easier to read and
        understand for most people.
        
        collective.prettydate is specially well suited for sites that produce a lot of
        content, like breaking news.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        This product provides a utility which will convert a DateTime object into a
        human readable text.
        
        ::
        
            from zope.component import getUtility
            from collective.prettydate.interfaces import IPrettyDate
            date_utility = getUtility(IPrettyDate)
        
        At this point, you can use the 'date' method to convert the DateTime object
        
        ::
        
            from DateTime import DateTime
            today = DateTime()
            str_date = date_utility.date(today)
        
        in previous example, 'str_date' will be "now"
        
        'date' method also allows 2 additional parameters: 'short' and 'asdays' which
        will modify the output to be in short format ('h' instead of 'hours', 'd'
        instead of 'days', etc) and whole days (it will use 'today' instead of any
        amount of seconds, minutes or hours for current day). They both default to
        "False".
        
        Timezones
        ^^^^^^^^^
        
        If your server timezone is configured correctly, and the DateTime object
        contains valid timezone info, then the text output will reflect the correct
        time. You do not need to convert date and time between different timezones.
        
        Output examples
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        * '4 hours ago'
        * '4h ago' (short format)
        * 'in 28 minutes'
        * 'in 6 months'
        * 'today'
        * 'last week'
        * 'yesterday'
        * 'last year'
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        To enable this product in a buildout-based installation:
        
        1. Edit your buildout.cfg and add ``collective.prettydate`` to the list of
           eggs to install ::
        
            [buildout]
            ...
            eggs =
                collective.prettydate
        
        2. You may need to extend a five.grok known good set (KGS) to make sure that
           you get the right versions of the packages that make up five.grok ::
        
            [buildout]
            ...
            extends =
                http://good-py.appspot.com/release/five.grok/1.2.0-1?plone=4.1
        
        After updating the configuration you need to run ''bin/buildout'', which will
        take care of updating your system.
