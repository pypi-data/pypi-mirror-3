Description: django-resto (REplicated STOrage) provides file storage backends that can store
        files coming into a Django site on several servers simultaneously, using HTTP.
        ``HybridStorage`` will store the files locally on the filesystem and remotely,
        while ``DistributedStorage`` will only store them remotely.
        
        This works for files uploaded by users through the admin or through custom
        Django forms, and also for files created by the application code, provided it
        uses the standard `storage API`_.
        
        django-resto is useful for sites deployed in a multi-server environment, in
        order to accept uploaded files and have them available on all media servers
        immediately for subsequent web requests that could be routed to any machine.
        
        `django-resto`_ is a fork of `django_dust`_ with a strong focus on consistency,
        while django_dust is more concerned with availability. The two projects cover
        different use-cases.
