=========
 Amalgam
=========

Amalgam is a thin wrapper over various ORM solutions, intended to simplify and
unify initialization and declaration of models for various stores.

The only built-in backend right now is SQLAlchemy, which means that currently
Amalgam is just a wrapper over SQLAlchemy (a bit like `Elixir`_), providing
interface which is cleaner than default.

See `docs`_ for more information.
