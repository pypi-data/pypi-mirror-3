# This module is registered by ebdata.retrieval.__init__ so that
# client code can simply use 'import logging' instead of having to set up
# the logging infrastructure on a case-by-case basis.
#
# Client code should use this like so:
#     import logging
#     # logger name should start with 'eb.retrieval.' to use this.
#     logger = logging.getLogger('eb.retrieval.scrapers.chicago.crime')
#     logger.warn('...')
#     logger.info('...')
