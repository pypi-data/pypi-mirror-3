Installing a third party application
====================================

This document describes how to deploy an application on the Nagare framework

Prerequisites
-------------

The Nagare framework must be installed as explained in :wiki:`NagareInstallation`.

Installing the application
--------------------------

If the application is available on the `PyPi <http://pypi.python.org>`_, use
the command:

  .. code-block:: sh
  
     <NAGARE_HOME>/bin/easy_install <application>
     
else, retrieve the application archive or egg and install it with:

  .. code-block:: sh
  
     <NAGARE_HOME>/bin/easy_install <path/to/the/archive>

To check the application is correctly registered to Nagare, enter:

  .. code-block:: sh
  
     <NAGARE_HOME>/bin/nagare-admin serve
     
which lists all the registered applications.

The application is installed in is own directory under
``<NAGARE_HOME>/lib/python2.5/site-packages``

Serving the application
-----------------------

Check, in the ``conf`` directory of the application that the parameters of
the configuration file are correct for your environment. For example, check
that the database URI is correct if the application uses a database. 

If the application uses a database, create the database tables:

  .. code-block:: sh
  
     <NAGARE_HOME>/bin/nagare-admin create-db <application>

Then, the application is launched with:

  .. code-block:: sh
       
     <NAGARE_HOME>/bin/nagare-admin serve <application>

To know how to configure an application, consult the
:wiki:`ApplicationConfiguration` guide.

To change the way the application is published, consult the
:wiki:`PublisherConfiguration` guide.
