Description: ***********************************************************
          HTSQL -- A Query Language for the Accidental Programmer
        ***********************************************************
        
        HTSQL ("Hyper Text Structured Query Language") is a high-level query
        language for relational databases.   The target audience for HTSQL is
        the accidental programmer -- one who is not a SQL expert, yet needs a
        usable, comprehensive query tool for data access and reporting.  
        
        HTSQL is also a web service which takes a request via HTTP, translates
        it into a SQL query, executes the query against a relational database,
        and returns the results in a format requested by the user agent (JSON,
        CSV, HTML, etc.).
        
        Use of HTSQL with open source databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite) is
        royalty free under BSD-style conditions.  Use of HTSQL with proprietary
        database systems (Oracle, Microsoft SQL) requires a commercial license.
        See ``LICENSE`` for details.
        
        For installation instructions, see ``INSTALL``.  For list of new
        features in this release, see ``NEWS``.  HTSQL documentation is in the
        ``doc`` directory.

        Installation Instructions
        =========================
        
        Download HTSQL source code::
        
            $ hg clone http://bitbucket.org/prometheus/htsql
        
        Build and install HTSQL::
        
            $ cd htsql
            $ make build
            # make install
        
        Installing HTSQL creates a ``htsql-ctl`` script.  For general help and
        a list of commands, run::
        
            $ htsql-ctl help
        
        To start a command-line HTSQL shell, run::
        
            $ htsql-ctl shell DBURI
        
        To start an HTTP server running HTSQL, run::
        
            $ htsql-ctl server DBURI [HOST [PORT]]
        
        Here, ``DBURI`` specifies how to connect to the database and must have
        the form::
        
            ENGINE://USER:PASS@HOST:PORT/DATABASE

        List of Changes
        ===============
        
        
        2.2.0 beta 1 (2011-09-20)
        -------------------------
        
        * Fixed silent data truncation bug on invalid values; users of SQLite
          are adviced to upgrade.
        * Added support for loading application configuration from a file;
          option `-C FILE`.
        * Refactored plugin architecture; added support for plugin parameters.
        * Added SQLAlchemy adapter.
        * Added support for statement-like functions; converted formatters
          to statements.
        * Added plugin `tweak.meta`: database metadata exposed as a database.
        * Added plugin `tweak.shell`: a simple web-based HTSQL editor.
        * Removed plugin `tweak.schema`: functionality is implemented in
          the core.
        
        
        2.1.1 final (2011-08-30)
        ------------------------
        
        * General code cleanup and refactoring.
        * Improved emitted SQL for projections and aggregates.
        * Changed operator precedence to avoid parentheses around
          filtering and projection operators.
        * Added a test data generator for HTSQL regression tests
          (thank to Yuri Yerokhin).
        * Added support for hierarchical headers for `/:txt` and `/:html`
          formatters.
        * Updated documentation.
        
        
        2.1.0 rc 1 (2011-06-21)
        -----------------------
        
        * Added `/:tsv` formatter that generates output in tab-separated format
          (thank to Andrey Popp).
        * A lot of updates to the tutorial, the reference and other
          documentation.
        * Minor code updates and bug fixes.
        
        
        2.1.0 beta 3 (2011-05-13)
        -------------------------
        
        * Added a fiber linking operator: `{x,y} -> T{x,y}`.
        * Provide named attributes for kernel expressions and the complement
          link in a quotient scope: `(program^degree)` generates attribute
          `degree` as an alias for `*1` and `program` as an alias for `^`.
        * Added in-selector definitions: `{attr := expr}` is de-sugared to
          `define(attr := expr){attr}`.
        * Added `$reference` syntax for inter-scope references.
        * Added flow method `fork()`: clone the last node in the flow, e.g.
          `/course?credits=max(fork().credits)`.
        * Added flow methods `.filter()` and `.select()` as aliases to `?`
          and `{}` operators.
        * Added method `distinct()`: `distinct(table{kernel})` produces
          a flow of unique values of `kernel` as it runs over `table`;
          it is equivalent to `table^kernel`.  `distinct()` and `^` operators
          now filter out NULL values in the kernel.
        * Changed semantics of `.` and `{}` expressions: specifier (`.`)
          now allows arbitrary expressions on both sides, selector (`{}`)
          now sets the output columns in the current scope.
        * Added syntax `*N`, where `N` is an integer literal, to get the value
          of the `N`-th output column.
        * Added addon `tweak.cors`: append `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`
          to every HTTP response.
        * Added addon `tweak.pgsql.inet`: basic manipulations on values
          of `INET` data type.
        * Added addon `tweak.pgsql.view`: determine foreign key relationships
          for views in Postgresql.
        * Use `search_path` or its analogues to choose a table when
          the table name is ambiguous.
        * Optimized introspection for Oracle.
        * Added option `-p` to ask for a password on startup.
        * Added shell command `run filename.htsql` to load and execute
          an HTSQL query from a file.
        * Many other fixes and documentation updates.
        
        
        2.1.0 beta 2 (2011-03-29)
        -------------------------
        
        * Added support for `datetime` and `time` date types.
        * Added support for calculated attributes, `define()` and `where()`
          macros.
        * Added addon `tweak.pgsql.catalog`: configure primary and foreign keys
          for `pg_catalog.*` tables.
        * Added addon `tweak.schema`: allow addressing a table in a specified schema
          as `<schema>_<table>` identifier.
        * Added addon `tweak.autolimit`: add ``LIMIT`` clause to each query.
        * Added addon `tweak.pgsql.timeout`: set statement timeout for each query.
        * Added Jinja integration demo.
        * Many minor fixes and updates.
        
        
        2.1.0 beta 1 (2011-03-08)
        -------------------------
        
        * Ported to MySQL, Oracle and MS SQL Server.
        * Added support for projections (`base^kernel`).
        
        
        2.0.1 final (2011-02-01)
        ------------------------
        
        * Merged `/:json` and `/:jsonex` formatters; use `/:jsonex` layout
          to avoid CSRF issues.
        * Documentation updates.
        
        
        2.0.0 rc 1 (2011-01-21)
        -----------------------
        
        * HTRAF demo is promoted to a standalone project; see
          http://bitbucket.org/prometheus/htraf.
        * Added `/:jsonex` format: JSON with extra metadata.
        * Documentation updates.
        
        
        2.0.0 beta 5 (2010-12-14)
        -------------------------
        
        * Completed the SQLite backend.
        * Completed the standard library.
        
        
        2.0.0 beta 4 (2010-12-05)
        -------------------------
        
        * Refactored peep-hole optimization of the frame tree and SQL
          serialization; refined the generated SQL.
        * Refactored the internal API for adding functions.
        * Added new (experimental) syntax for infix function call.
        * Added an "Examples" section to the documentation.
        * Fixed compatibility with Python 2.5.
        * Many minor bugfixes, documentation updates, etc.
        
        
        2.0.0 beta 3 (2010-11-09)
        -------------------------
        
        * Refactored the translator from the term tree to the frame tree;
          added a new translation step to collapse nested frames and reduce
          SQL expressions.
        * Added the HTRAF demo: use HTSQL with client-side javascript
          to define complex dashboards.
        * Added the SSI demo: using HTSQL for web without giving direct access
          to the database.
        * Updated the tutorial, minor bugfixes, regression test updates, etc.
        
        
        2.0.0 beta 2 (2010-10-01)
        -------------------------
        
        * Refactored the translator from the expression graph to the term tree.
        * Added `Content-Disposition` header to `:json` and `:csv` renderers.
        * Merged the tutorial to the repository.
        
        
        2.0.0 beta 1 (2010-09-21)
        -------------------------
        
        * Initial beta release.
        * PostgreSQL and SQLite backends are (mostly) supported, the former
          more than the latter.
        * The SQL translator needs more work, in particular, the term tree,
          the frame structure and the serializer.
        * Lots of functions are either not implemented or missing a proper
          serializer, especially in the SQLite backend.
        * Other areas which need more work before the final release: rendering,
          introspection, regression tests and documentation.
