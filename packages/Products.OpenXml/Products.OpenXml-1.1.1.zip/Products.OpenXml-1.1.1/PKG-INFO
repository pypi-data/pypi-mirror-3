        About OpenXml
        #############
        
        OpenXml provides Plone resources for OpenXml documents :
        
        * A set of icons for Office 2007 documents
        * A set of PortalTransforms plugins suitable to OpenXml documents
          indexing
        
        Requirements
        ############
        
        * Plone 2.5, Plone 3.x, or Plone 4.0 (note that indexing of OpenXml 
          documents in ATFile or FileFields only works from Plone 3.x onwards
          due to AT changes in field indexing).
        
        * openxmllib 1.0.0 (+) for Python:
          http://code.google.com/p/openxmllib/
        
        * Note that openxmllib requires the - excellent - lxml. See the
          instructions provided in openxmllib documentation.
        
        Note that if you install OpenXml with zc.buildout, you should not care about
        installing openxmllib or lxml.
        
        
        Install
        #######
        
        With zc.buildout
        ----------------
        
        From now, OpenXml is an egg, but you already know it if you're reading
        this browsing the pypi site. So to get the latest distro suitable to
        your Plone, you only need to add ``Products.OpenXml`` to the eggs list
        of your ``buildout.cfg``.
        
        Without zc.buildout
        -------------------
        
        ::
        
          $ easy_install openxmllib
        
        Install the OpenXml directory from the unzipped egg into your instance Products
        folder.

        1.1.1 (2012-09-03)
        ##################
        
        * Added marker file in the profile directory to not execute the import step
          every time a third party add-on is installed.
          [vincentfretin]
        
        1.1.0
        #####
        
        * Updated mimetypes registry unit test to work with Plone 4 as well since
          isImplentedBy doesn't exist on InterfaceClass objects.
          [davidjb]
        * Modified setup handler to overwrite existing mimetype registry entries
          as Plone 4 provides a basic implementation.
          [davidjb]
        
        1.0.3
        #####
        
        * Added dependency on openxmllib 1.0.6 due to API changes and bugfix on large
          powerpoint files.
          [glenfant]
        
        * Added metadata.xml to the GS-profile to avoid DeprecationWarning "Version for
          profile Products.OpenXml:default taken from version.txt"
          [WouterVH]
        
        1.0.2
        #####
        
        https://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/Products.OpenXml/tags/1.0.2
        
        * Removed unnecessary required eggs.
        
        1.0.1
        #####
        
        https://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/Products.OpenXml/tags/1.0.1
        
        * Added Plone 2.5 compatibility. Note that ATFile that ships with Plone 2.5 does
          not attempt to index file contents. So only icons and mime types work on a
          Vanilla Plone 2.5. If you need support for indexing, consider using
          AttachmentField and PloneExFile that fit with Plone 2.5. As a consequence, the
          unit test "testATfileSearchableText" fails.
          [glenfant]
        
        * Fixed a typo in unit tests.
          [glenfant]
        
        1.0.0
        #####
        
        https://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/Products.OpenXml/tags/1.0.0
        
        * Added new mime types to the "mimetypes" standard module (should be
          done by openxmllib in next release)
          [glenfant]
        
        * Transform support when mime type is not provided but the filename is
          available.
          [glenfant]
        
        * Log the error message and traceback when the user provides a crappy
          file.
