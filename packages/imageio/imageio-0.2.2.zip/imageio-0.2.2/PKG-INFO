Description:  
        The imageio library aims to support reading and writing a wide 
        range of image data, including animated images, volumetric data, and
        scientific formats. It is written in pure Python (2.x and 3.x) and
        is designed to be powerful, yet simple in usage and installation.
        
        The imageio library is intended as a replacement for PIL. Currently, most
        functionality is obtained by wrapping the FreeImage library using ctypes. 
        
        Quickstart:
        
          * Use imageio.imread to read an image
          * Use imageio.imsave to save an image
          * See the `functions page <http://imageio.readthedocs.org/en/latest/functions.html>`_ for more information.
