Description: 
          This class provides the methods to deal algebrically with quaternions. Quaternions operations are implemented, including square and cubic roots evaluations.
          Hurwitz quaternions can also be used. For Hurwitz quaternions modular operations are implemented.
          Moreover, other algebraic tools are available, such as Cross Ratio and Moebius transformations.
