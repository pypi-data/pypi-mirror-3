WWScraper
=========

Introduction
------------
WWScraper is a module designed to scrape the mobile WeightWatchers website.

It currently allows you to query points info for foods and pull some general information about the current user.   It requires a WeightWatchers eTools account.

This module is in no way affiliated with WeightWatchers International, and is not guaranteed to continue to work in the event of changes to their mobile site.  It requires you have a valid, paid eTools account in order to access this data.

History
-------
I designed this module as I was not happy with the WW website requiring me to load up a bulky flash app just to search for foods, and the mobile interface is quite clumsy even in a full blown browser.

Requirements
------------
mechanize
BeautifulSoup

Basic Usage
-----------
    from WWScraper import WWScrape
    
    # Instantiate the object, and connect
    ww_site = WWScrape()
    ww_site.connect('wwmobileuser','wwmobilepass')
    
    # Do a food search
    potato_data = ww_site.food_search('potato')
    
    # Display our results (provided in tuples)
    for result in potato_data:
        print "Name: %s, ID: %s, Serving: %s, Points: %s" % result
