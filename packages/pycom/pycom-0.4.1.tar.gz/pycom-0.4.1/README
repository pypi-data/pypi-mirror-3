Introduction
=============

PyCOM is simple and easy-to-use distributed component model written in Python.
PyCOM makes different parts of your network application isolated and
independent, while allowing easy and straightforward interaction between them.
PyCOM may be seen as an easy and lightweight web services replacement.

Ideology highlights:

- Non-intrusive design without black magic and lots of auto-generated code
- Effective, easy-to-implement and portable protocol
- Support for binary attachments of any size
- Support for stateful services via HTTP-alike sessions
- Low level enough to build your own frameworks
- ... and still simple enough to be used as is
- Python 2 and Python 3 support out-of-box

Technical highlights:

- Pluggable protocol support (default is JSON over ZeroMQ aka `zerojson`)
- Easily extensible core library
- Does not required special "container" software
- Introspection support for services
- Comprehensive test suite and documentation
- Free software (new BSD license)

There is ongoing effort to create a C++ client library for PyCOM:

Main concepts
--------------

With PyCOM you build your application as a number of *services*,
each running in it's own process (or even on it's own computer).
You maintain a PyCOM *nameserver* for finding services by their names
(by the way, nameserver itself is a service).

Services provide *interfaces*, i.e. a named way of interacting with service.
They are somewhat similar to interfaces in e.g. Java, but note that
PyCOM does not perform any checks on interfaces. Interface usually has
some amount of *methods*.

Services are identified by path with parts separated by slashes,
e.g. ``/com/foo/group/service``.

Interfaces are identified by name with parts separated by dots,
e.g. ``com.foo.my-interface``.

Examples
---------

Service example (module ``service1.module1``)::

    import pycom

    @pycom.interface("com.foo.example")
    class Query(pycom.Service):

        @pycom.method("create")
        def method_create(self, request):
            return {"field1" : request.args}

    pycom.main()

Example command line for running this service (provided nameserver is running
on ``192.168.10.1:2012``)::

    python -m pycom -a tcp://192.168.10.2:2013 -n tcp://192.168.10.1:2012 service1.module1

Example client code for this service::

    import pycom

    pycom.configure(nameserver="192.168.10.1:2012")

    query = pycom.locate("com.foo.example")
    print query.invoke("create", 42)
    # Prints {"field1" : 42}
    print query.introspect()
    # Prints a lot of introspection information

Quick start
------------

To test (logs will be saved in `test.log`)::

    $ python test.py

To build HTML documentation (requires `Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org>`_)::

    $ python setup.py build_sphinx
    $ <your-browser> build/sphinx/html/index.html

To install::

    $ python setup.py install

or via `pip`::

    $ pip install pycom
