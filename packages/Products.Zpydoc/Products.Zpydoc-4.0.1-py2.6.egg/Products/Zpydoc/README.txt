Zpydoc
------

pydoc for Zope and Plone.

Zpydoc documents any python module loaded into the Zope server.  There are sophisticated
permissions allowing you to control which modules are available via Zpydoc and to whom.

In addition, there are Plone skins too, allowing you to control the look and feel of the
documentation.

You are encouraged to offer feedback through http://www.last-bastion.net/forge/zpydoc.
