Description: django-jasmine
        ============
        
        django-jasmine integrates the [Jasmine Javascript testing framework][1] with [Django][2].  Jasmine is a behavior-driven development framework for testing your JavaScript code. It does not depend on any other JavaScript frameworks. It does not require a DOM. And it has a clean, obvious syntax so that you can easily write tests.
