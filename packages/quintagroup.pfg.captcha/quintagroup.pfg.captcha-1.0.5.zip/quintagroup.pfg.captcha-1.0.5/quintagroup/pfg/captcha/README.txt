Quintagroup PloneFormGen Captcha Field (quintagroup.pfg.captcha) allows to add captcha field to PloneFormGen forms.

Usage

  To add captcha to PloneFormGen forms you need to install PloneFormGen first (for creating the form itself). After that install Quintagroup PloneFormGen CaptchaField (for adding captcha field to the forms), it will be installed together with Quintagroup Captcha Core (quintagroup.captcha.core) package that enables Plone captchas on Plone sites.

  Make sure you install PloneFormGen first, otherwise quintagroup.pfg.captcha may fail to work correctly.

  quintagroup.pfg.captcha plugs to PloneFormGen forms, so after successful installation you will have a new field among fields available for PloneFormGen form - Captcha Field. Everything you need to do is to select this field from 'Add..' drop-down menu and save it.

Supported Plone versions

  Plone 3.x, Plone 4.0
