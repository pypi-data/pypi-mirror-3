  <h1>Poulda &mdash; a simple file upload service</h1>

  <div class="layout">

    <p>
      Poulda is a simple file upload web service. It comes from a need
      I have to receive large files from friends and family who would
      not be bothered to use FTP or anything more complex than a web
      browser interface. Amongst its features are such diverse
      elements as:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>only authenticated users may upload a file;</li>
      <li>user accounts (login and password) are set up in the WSGI
        configuration file;</li>
      <li>a progress bar appears during the upload (unless you disabled
        JavaScript);</li>
      <li>relatively old browsers should be supported relatively well;</li>
      <li>the user interface is in English or French, hopefully not both at
        the same time.</li>
    </ul>

    </div>

    <h2 class="clear">Requirements</h2>
    <p>
      Poulda requires Python 2.7.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you use Nginx, you should use
      the <a href="http://wiki.nginx.org/HttpUploadProgressModule">Upload
      Progress module</a>. If you do not use this module, Nginx will
      read the entirety of the uploaded file before passing on to the
      WSGI server, which obviously defeats the purpose of this
      application. For further details about the support for this
      module, see the <a href="#nginx-support">related section</a>
      below.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you do not use the aforementioned Nginx module, you need an
      RDBMS. SQLite will do very well unless you expect a large number
      of simultaneous users (in which case you may want to think twice
      anyway, since Poulda has not been developed and tested to scale
      up).
    </p>

    <h2>Installation</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          It is highly recommended that you install Poulda in a
          <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv">virtual
          environment</a>. Once you have one, you may install Poulda
          and its dependencies with (note the extra requirement):
        </p>
        <pre>$ easy_install Poulda[db]</pre>
        <p>
          If you use the Nginx Upload Progress module, you need not
          the database-related Python packages, so the following line
          will pull the minimum requirements:
        </p>
        <pre>$ easy_install Poulda</pre>
      </li>
      <li>
        Download
        the <a href="https://raw.github.com/dbaty/poulda/master/development.ini">development
        WSGI configuration file</a> and make appropriate changes (see the
        <a href="#configuration">Configuration</a> section below). The
        source repository also provides <a href="https://raw.github.com/dbaty/poulda/master/production.ini">a more production-ready
        configuration file</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Install Waitress (or use your preferred WSGI server and
          tweak the WSGI configuration file):
        </p>
        <pre>$ easy_install Waitress</pre>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>And finally start the application:</p>
        <pre>$ pserve production.ini</pre>
      </li>
      <li></li>
    </ol>

    <h2 id="configuration">Configuration</h2>
    <p>
      The WSGI configuration file should be modified to fit your system
      and your needs:
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt><code>poulda.accounts</code></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          A space (or new line) separated list of user accounts. Each
          user account is composed by the login, followed by a colon,
          followed by the password. Passwords must not contain the
          space character.
        </p>
        <p>Examples:</p>
        <pre>
poulda.accounts = jsmith:secret jane.doe:mYp3ssWord
poulda.accounts = jsmith:secret
                  jane.doe:mYp3ssWord</pre>
      </dd>
      <dt><code>poulda.db_url</code></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>The database connection string.</p>
        <p>Examples:</p>
        <pre>
poulda.db_url = sqlite:///%(here)s/Poulda.db
poulda.db_url = postgresql://poulda:secret@localhost/poulda</pre>
        <p>
          This directive is ignored
          if <code>poulda.nginx_upload_progress</code> is enabled.
        </p>
      </dd>
      <dt><code>poulda.enabled</code></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          The string "true" if you wish to enable the service. If any
          other value is provided, all pages will show a message that
          indicates that the service is disabled (and users will not
          be able to do anything).
        </p>
      </dd>
      <dt><code>poulda.nginx_upload_progress</code></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          The string "true" if you use Nginx Upload Progress module.
          If any other value is provided, the support will be
          disabled.
        </p>
      </dd>
      <dt><code>poulda.secret</code></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          A secret string that will be used to encrypt authentication
          tokens.
        </p>
      </dd>
      <dt><code>poulda.upload_dir</code></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          The path to the directory where uploaded files will be stored.
        </p>
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <h2 id="nginx-support">Support for Nginx Upload Progress</h2>
    <p>
      Once you have the Nginx Upload Progress module installed, you
      must first enable it in the WSGI configuration as stated
      above. Also, your Nginx configuration file should be
      modified. See below for an example (the context being
      an <code>http</code> section).
    </p>
    <pre>
# This line is required by the module.
upload_progress uploads 1m;

upstream poulda {
  # Our upstream application, in this example served by uWSGI on
  # a UNIX socket. 
  server unix:/var/www/exemple.com/var/uwsgi.sock;
}

server {
  # The usual stanza.
  listen        80;
  server_name   exemple.com;

  # The default value is set to 1Mb.
  client_max_body_size 500M;

  location /static/ {
    alias       /var/www/exemple.com/static/;
  }

  # This section is required.
  location ^~ /progress {
    upload_progress_json_output;
    report_uploads    uploads;
  }

  location / {
    # Those two lines are because we use uWSGI. YMMV.  
    uwsgi_pass          poulda;
    include             uwsgi_params;
    # This one is required, though.
    track_uploads       uploads 30s;
  }
}</pre>
