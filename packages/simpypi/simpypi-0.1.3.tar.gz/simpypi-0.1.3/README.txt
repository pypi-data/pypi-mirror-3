Simple python package index

How simpypi works
-----------------

The heart of simpypi is ``simpypi.wsgi.SimPyPI``, a simple
`WSGI <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0333/>`_ web app that
accepts a uploaded
`python package <http://guide.python-distribute.org/introduction.html>`_
distribution and places it according to its name and version metadata
appropriate to the
`simple index protocol <http://guide.python-distribute.org/contributing.html#the-simple-index-protocol>`_ .

For security, ``SimPyPI`` returns straight
`HTTP 400 <http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html>`_ s
for invalid requests.  This could probably be improved.

``SimPyPI`` itself does not serve this directory.  The directory
should be served by a fileserver that will generate directory indices
(as apprpropriate to
http://guide.python-distribute.org/contributing.html#the-simple-index-protocol
) such as Apache or
`FileServer <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/FileServer>`_ .
``simpypi.factory.factory`` does provide a factory to make a WSGI app
that wraps ``FileServer`` in middleware and serves the simple index
under ``/index/`` and the ``SimPyPI`` app at ``/``.  Additionally, a
``simpypi`` command line program is provided that front-ends this.

Currently ``simpypi`` only works on source distributions (that is,
packages made with ``python setup.py sdist``).

Example
-------

I installed an instance of ``simpypi`` at http://k0s.org:8080 for
demonstration purposes with a package index at http://k0s.org:8080/index/ .
For testing purposes, I made a script,
`upload_mobase.py <http://k0s.org/mozilla/hg/simpypi/file/tip/tests/upload_mozbase.py>`_
that uploads the
`mozbase <https://github.com/mozilla/mozbase>`_ packages to
``simpypi``.  So the
`index <http://k0s.org:8080/index/>`_ is now populated with them.

You can upload packages with
`curl <http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/documentation/curl/>`_ ::

    > wget http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/P/PyYAML/PyYAML-3.10.tar.gz
    > curl -F 'package=@PyYAML-3.10.tar.gz' http://k0s.org:8080/

You can ``easy_install`` mozbase from http://k0s.org:8080/index/ .
If a package's dependencies can be found from the ``simpypi`` package
index, they will also be installed from the index::

Note that all of the packages come from the k0s.org installation and
not from http://pypi.python.org/ .


Running the Tests
-----------------

The
`tests directory <http://k0s.org/mozilla/hg/simpypi/file/tip/tests>`_
contains
`doctests <http://docs.python.org/library/doctest.html>`_ and
the test-runner,
`test.py <http://k0s.org/mozilla/hg/simpypi/file/tip/tests/test.py>`_ .
These tests illustrate basic functionality and protect from
regressions if they are run before code is committed.
``tests-require.txt`` contains dependencies that should be installed
to run the tests.
`Paste <http://pythonpaste.org/>`_
`TestApp <http://pythonpaste.org/testing-applications.html>`_ ,
though this could be transitioned to
`WebTest <http://webtest.pythonpaste.org/en/latest/index.html>`_ .
`virtualenv <http://www.virtualenv.org/>`_
is used for isolating python environments.

To run the tests, do::

    python test.py

TODO
----

While simpypi is pretty simple, just because it is only 100 lines of
code doesn't mean that it is the *right* 100 lines of code.  The
following issues could be addressed:

 * the temporary package should be dealt with entirely in memory,
   ideally.  Currently we write to a file and move it.

 * ``simpypi`` use ``pkginfo.sdist`` to read the data from a source
   distribution. Instead, the uploaded package should probably be
   unpacked and ``python setup.py sdist`` run and the resulting
   package put in the appropriate place.  This will allow archives
   without ``PKG-INFO``
   (e.g. http://hg.mozilla.org/build/talos/archive/tip.tar.gz )
   to be uploaded as well as at least partially correct for the fact
   that currently ``simpypi`` only works for uploaded source
   distributions.
